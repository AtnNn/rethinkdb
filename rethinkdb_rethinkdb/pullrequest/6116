      "- [ ] I have read and agreed to the RethinkDB Contributor License Agreement http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/\n### Description\n\nI've had variations of this patch around for a while and so finally decided to find out if you're interested.\n\nI had noticed that mailbox_t in typed.hpp was an auto generated file by a python script, so I went about updating this to C++11's variadic templates.\n\nI kept this working for C++11, though that meant implementing index_sequence which is a C++14 feature, C++17's std::apply would reduce the helper code too, but that's for the future.\n\nNot included in this request are commits, moving the tuple serialize code to  archive/stl_types.hpp with the rest stl serialize code.\n\nIf you find this useful and would like to push I will complete the CLA.\nCheers\nIan\n"
