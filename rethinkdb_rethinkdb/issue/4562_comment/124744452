      "My current suspicion is that something is terminating TCP connections that have been inactive for a while, but the client only notices that the connection has been terminated when it tries to send some new data.\r\n\r\nThis might also be at the source for https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4572 , though that's all still somewhat speculative. We are currently thinking about adding \"keepalive\" heartbeats to the protocol that would make sure that the connections don't remain inactive for too long.\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to reproduce the problem on an Oracle Linux 6 VM so far, but will investigate  more."
