      "@nayan9 Thank you for the report. We have not seen this before.\r\n\r\nA few questions so we can try to reproduce this locally:\r\nWhich version of Oracle Linux are you running? Could you also post the output of `uname -a`?\r\n\r\nIs the client running on the same machine as the RethinkDB server or remotely? Is it connecting through IPv4 or IPv6?\r\n\r\nAre there any suspicious messages in the RethinkDB server log? Could you maybe send me the full server log by email (daniel@rethinkdb.com)?\r\n\r\nHow frequently / reliably does this happen?"
