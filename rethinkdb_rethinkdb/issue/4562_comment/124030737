      "> A few questions so we can try to reproduce this locally:\r\n> Which version of Oracle Linux are you running? Could you also post the output of uname -a?\r\n\r\n$ uname -a \r\nLinux ******.com 2.6.32-504.1.3.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Nov 11 07:57:22 PST 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n\r\n> Is the client running on the same machine as the RethinkDB server or remotely? \r\n\r\nRemotely\r\n\r\n> Is it connecting through IPv4 or IPv6?\r\n\r\nIPv4\r\n\r\n> Are there any suspicious messages in the RethinkDB server log? \r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n> Could you maybe send me the full server log by email (daniel@rethinkdb.com)?\r\n\r\nEmail is on the way.\r\n\r\n> How frequently / reliably does this happen?\r\n\r\nI can't put a firm number on it.  The way we have been reproducing it is by submitting a series of queries, waiting for a few minutes and then submitting another set.  In the second set, we will see one or two failures.  A guess: 10% failure rate with this scenario.\r\n\r\n> Is there anything special about your network setup?\r\n\r\nNothing specific with few folks that I was able to check with.\r\n\r\n> Any IP-level routers or firewalls between the servers or things like that? \r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n> Any non-default configuration options for the network stack (e.g. the flags in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/) that might be relevant?\r\n\r\nEmail is on the way."
