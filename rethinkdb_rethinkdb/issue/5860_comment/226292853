      "@hgill Check out https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5823 .\r\nWhile the functionality described in that issue doesn't directly allow you to open a changefeed that includes the current time, it will allow you to automatically flag documents that are older than 15 minutes by setting an \"outdated\" field on them (or similar). You can then create an index and open a changefeed on that field, which will give you the functionality you need.\r\n\r\nThere are some details to how you'd need to set this up that I'm happy to explain once we have agreed on a full API in #5823. Please feel free to ping me on this issue again when that is done so I don't forget.\r\n\r\nThis is also related to some of the things discussed in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3583 , though the original proposal in that issue had a more limited scope.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this as a duplicate as we've discussed related things in other issues and there's soon going to be a solution for doing what you need. Let me know if you feel like the existing issues don't sufficiently cover your use case."
