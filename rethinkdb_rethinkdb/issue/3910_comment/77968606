      "@deontologician query_limit is stored as a data explorer option and pulls from state, and the check is only made upon changing.\r\n\r\n@chrisvariety since time increase from large row returns is completely subjective to the data returned, I just opted to put a note next to the input box that lets the user know that returning more rows will increase the load time.  Also, changed parseInt to use base 10 radix."
