      "@justinmealey  This looks good overall, I think it just needs a couple changes:\r\n\r\n1. Wrap up the \"localStorage or 40\" check up into a single method, right now the logic is duplicated a lot\r\n2. Move the option into the dataexplorer options template `admin/static/handlebars/dataexplorer-options-template.handlebars`. The option panel it's in now is for overall webui options, and this only applies to the data explorer.\r\n\r\nOther than that this looks good, it'll make a nice addition"
