      "Just a note I don't think you'll be able to set this to e.g. 100,000 and expect everything to work... at some point the browser will simply hang or crash trying to display that much data, which may end up looking like a Web UI bug in the future. Not sure if an upper limit makes sense or a warning or what, but figured I would bring it up.\r\n\r\nAlso, you should **always** specify a radix when using `parseInt`, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt for more details."
