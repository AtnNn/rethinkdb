      "The main reason we should provide all errors and not just one is to recover in case of failures.\r\n\r\nCurrently if people send a range update/batch insert, they have no way to recover in case of errors.\r\nSending only the key doesn't help in case of inserts (since you don't know what documents map to the uuids returned).\r\n\r\nI'm in favor of sending back the whole document."
