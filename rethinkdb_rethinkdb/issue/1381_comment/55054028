      "It should be noted that if you use something like the `warning` machinery I included for the multi-change ticket, it handles deduplication inherently ('cuz I needed it there).\r\n\r\nAs for return_error_rows, would it be sufficient to give the primary key of the row and the table name?  That should be reasonably short and give you enough information to read it if you need it."
