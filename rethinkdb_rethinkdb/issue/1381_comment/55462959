      "In the case of inserts without generated keys, you can just look at the documents you inserted and see which one has that key.  In the case of inserts with generated keys, we send back the generated keys in the same order as the documents you provided, so you can just look at the offset.  (That said, I wouldn't be incredibly strongly opposed to returning the key by default and having an optarg `return_error_rows` that adds another field `row` to the error document, but if we do that then we're once-again dependent on #1375.  We could also do this and open a new issue for that optarg.)"
