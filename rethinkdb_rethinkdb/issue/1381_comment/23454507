      "Hi @underrun -- we've been talking about improving the error reporting for batch operations for quite some time. There are clearly cases (like yours here, but also others) when reporting a single error and the number of errors is insufficient. We thought about a few ways to do this, but couldn't come up with anything we were really happy with.\r\n\r\nYour idea sounds cool (I don't think anything like this was proposed before). We have to think about this a bit more, but we'll definitely do something about this. We're working really hard on performance and scalability now, so it might be a little time before we get to this. There is definitely *something* we'll do about it (though I'm not sure what yet).\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, could you try inserting documents one at a time (possibly with soft durability on to speed things up) and looking at the errors?\r\n\r\nMoving to subsequent for now."
