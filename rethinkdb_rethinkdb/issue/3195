        "Whew!\n\nI spent a good three hours trying to understand the ramifications of upgrading the driver in my project to version 1.13.0-3 while the rethinkdb version on my box is 1.11.2. I had problems connecting to it, and I came across this [doc](http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/migration/). I tried to follow it, but I got a number of errors (sorry, I wish I had them still), and then I ended up just reverting back to rethinkdb v1.11.2 and using an old driver -> rethinkdb==1.12.0-2. \n\nI understand the process better now, but this was a bit of a mess to figure out. I would love to get some warning when I run the rethinkdb server, in the terminal, indicating which driver versions I should be using. \n"
