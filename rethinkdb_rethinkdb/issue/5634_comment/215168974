      "@wmark Thanks for putting so much work into this. I'll see if I can find anything suspicious in the kernel change logs. So Ubuntu 4.4.0-4 was bad, 4.4.0-21 is good it seems right?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I have also tested 2.3.0 and 2.3.1 on a larger server with more RAM (though I limited the cache size to 16 GB), and with two NUMA nodes. Both worked fine, despite the scheduler scheduling RethinkDB across both nodes. However I was running a much older kernel on the host, namely 3.13.0-85-generic. So it seems plausible that this is somehow related to a kernel detail."
