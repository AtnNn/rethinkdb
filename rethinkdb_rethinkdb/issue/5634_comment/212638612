      "It looks like Docker has a default size limit for the changed data of a given container, depending on the backend used.\r\nLooks like it used to be 10 GB ( https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/5151 ) though it was apparently bumped to 100 GB recently ( https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/14709 ).\r\n\r\nI wonder what happens if that limit is exhausted. Do you think it's possible that you're hitting this?"
