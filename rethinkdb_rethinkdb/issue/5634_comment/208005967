      "Running on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) (updated as of today), their Linux 4.4.0-4-generic, SSD with ext4.\r\n32 GiB ECC DDR4, amd64, Xeon E5-2676v3 (12 core+HT, Haswell). No _swap_.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB is yours published for Docker and started this way:\r\n```bash\r\n# sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory=1\r\n# (no memory limits were hit, though)\r\n\r\ndocker run --name bench_rethinkdb \\\r\n  -v /var/lib/rethinkdb:/data \\\r\n  --net=host --privileged \\\r\n  -d \\\r\n  rethinkdb:2.3 rethinkdb --bind all --no-update-check\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I've used 2.2.6 and 2.3.0.)\r\n\r\nI cannot send you the data directory, but the raw data ready for your import tool. Packed as _squashfs_ image of about 2.5 GiB. That's all what is needed to reproduce the issue. No NDA needed. If that's okay with you I will start the upload and link to it here in a day or two."
