      "Thanks for looking into this!\r\n\r\nhttps://[link not public anymore]/\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker run \\\r\n  -v /var/lib/rethinkdb:/data \\\r\n  --net=host --privileged \\\r\n  -d \\\r\n  rethinkdb:2.3 rethinkdb --bind all --no-update-check\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn database 'test' create a new table 'benchdata';\r\nremember to select _\"Ack writes only when written to disk\"_ \8592 NO.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo mount benchdata-people.csv.xz.squashfs /mnt\r\n\r\n/usr/local/bin/rethinkdb-import \\\r\n  --force --table test.benchdata \\\r\n  --format csv -f /mnt/*.csv \r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, depending on RethinkDB's cache size, writes/s drop to zero and RethinkDB stops responding.\r\n\r\nThe error occurs even with said importer. I've formerly used a script written in Go for that (which pushed the data in in batches for 100 rows/transaction), but found that it doesn't make any difference. It's been of no difference whether I used 'address' as string or nested map. It's been of no difference whether 'isMale' is a string or bool, 'birthday' datetime or string.\r\n\r\nI guess this is about millions of rows <512byte and something kicking in eventually.\r\n"
