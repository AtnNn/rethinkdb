      "It's a minimal change to the code (which is already templated), slightly faster (not a huge deal), only affects the one .cc file (so it won't seriously harm compile times), and more things can be checked at compile time.  None of which matter that much.  I would be fine with doing runtime-dispatch if people feel strongly about it, but since nobody replied 11 days ago I assumed nobody felt strongly."
