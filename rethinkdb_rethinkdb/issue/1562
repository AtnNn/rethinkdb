        "There are a few things I'd like to add to indexes to make them a bit nicer:\r\n\r\n- a way to get rows that errored\r\n- a way to wait for an index to be ready\r\n- a way to check if an index is ready\r\n- a way to get the completion percentage of an index\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I know how to do all of these, it shouldn't be too hard although maybe a bit of a pain. I also haven't thought too much about the API but here's a first stab:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nr.table(\"foo\").index_errors(\"index_name\") -> [{\"doc\" : {...}, \"error\" : ...} ...]\r\nr.table(\"foo\").index_wait(\"index_name\") -> (returns nothing)\r\nr.table(\"foo\").index_ready(\"index_name\") -> bool\r\nr.table(\"foo\").index_progress(\"index_name\") -> number\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also makes it easy to alert the user if they have indexes with errors. Maybe via a low severity issue or something of the sort."
