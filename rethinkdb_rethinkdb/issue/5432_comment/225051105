      "It looks like the new version throws a `ReqlDriverError` with the message \"Cursor is closed.\", while the old version might have thrown a different error, but in general had undefined behavior (it would sometimes return more rows and never throw an error, sometimes return a few results and then throw an error, and sometimes throw an error immediately).\r\n\r\nThe new behavior for the first time defines what the behavior for reading from a cursor after closing it is, so I'm not sure if this qualifies as a breaking change.\r\n\r\nIn general we should get better at pointing out changed error messages in our release notes though. We are currently not mentioning such changes anywhere."
