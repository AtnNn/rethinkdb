If the user tries to set `auth_key` to `\"<hidden>\"`, they will get this error message:\r\n``You're trying to write the string \"<hidden>\" to the `auth_key` field of the `auth` document in `rethinkdb.cluster_config`. \"<hidden>\" is what the `auth_key` field appears as if you try to read the current auth key; RethinkDB won't show you the real auth key for security reasons. To prevent confusion, RethinkDB won't let you set the auth key to the string \"<hidden>\".``"
