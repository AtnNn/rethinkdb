      "@danielmewes: I thought Slava's proposal was that you could write a string or `null`, and read `true` or `null`. My counter-proposal was that you could write a string or `null`, and read `\"<hidden>\"` or `null`. So I'm not sure where `false` is coming in. Were you proposing to replace `null` with `false`? I guess `true`/`false` makes more sense than `true`/`null`.\r\n\r\n@neumino: I don't understand your proposal. Are you suggesting to have two keys on the same document, or two documents in the table? Could you give some examples of what the document(s) would look like, and of queries to add and remove an auth key?"
