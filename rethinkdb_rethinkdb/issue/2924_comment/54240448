      "If writing to that table is the only way of setting the auth key (i.e. we don't wrap it into some neat UI that makes it look like it's something secure), I think having it visible in clear text would be ok. People will hopefully realize that the key will be readable and use an appropriate auth key.\r\n\r\nThere's still the issue with migration though, since in the old system the key was not accessible (through ReQL). So someone might have re-used a key in the belief that a security issue which allows an attacker to issue arbitrary ReQL commands wouldn't expose the key. This is probably not a huge issue, given that a) the new admin API will provide such an attacker with lots of other new privileges anyway and b) the client would already have to know the auth key, and a security breach that allows executing arbitrary ReQL would probably also expose the client's auth key anyway."
