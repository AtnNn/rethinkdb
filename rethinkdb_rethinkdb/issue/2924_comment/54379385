      "> Also, we would still want the convoluted error message in case they try to write {\"hidden\": True}.\r\n\r\nI think we could get away with a type error (\"auth key must be updated to a string\") or something, but I wouldn't be opposed to keeping the error message in if they try to update to the specific object `{hidden: true}`.\r\n\r\n> What if we called the field hidden_key and had it be true or false?\r\n\r\nI meant the toplevel document would be `{auth_key: {hidden: true}}`.  That seems slightly better because it signals to people that they can update `auth_key` (although it's still a little confusing because they need to update it to a string)."
