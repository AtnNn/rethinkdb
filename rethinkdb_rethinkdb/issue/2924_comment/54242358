      "So if the user runs:\r\n```python\r\nr.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"cluster_config\").get(\"auth\").update(r.row)\r\n```\r\nit will produce an error. I guess we can have a special error message if they try to write `true`. However, there's some risk that this will happen by accident; maybe a third-party client driver will assume it's always safe to run `.update(r.row)`, or something. I think it's probably OK to do this,, but it's still somewhat inelegant."
