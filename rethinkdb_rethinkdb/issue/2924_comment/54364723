      "@timmaxw Ah, my interpretation of Slava's proposal was that the value on reads would be either `true` or `false`, and that you would write a string or `null`. As you say, my suggested modification was to write either a string or `false` (not `null`), and to fail when writing `true`.\r\n\r\nAlso returning `<hidden>` and disallowing that string as an auth key sounds ok-ish, though it feels more hacky than returning `true` I think. With `true/false` it's clear that the domain of values you're getting when reading the document is separate from the one you can set auth keys from."
