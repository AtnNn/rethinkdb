      "Should the auth key be readable? That might be unexpected from a security perspective.\r\n\r\nWe could display it as `true` or `false` (depending on whether a key is set) without showing the actual key value. That would be sort of weird though, since the field would take a different type when writing to it than what it returns when reading it.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should consider switching to a (salted) hash for storing the auth key as part of this.\r\n\r\nLater we could also change the client communication to use a challenge-response protocol, but that's a separate issue."
