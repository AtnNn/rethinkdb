      "I think `true`/`false` is intuitive enough. I don't think the difference in clarity between that and `\"<hidden>\"` is that big.\r\n\r\nA remaining question regarding that proposal is whether we want to allow writing `false` to the value to delete the auth key. I think we should. Only writing `true` should cause an error.\r\n\r\nGenerally I don't particularly like the fact that the value we write is different from the value we read. Thinking about it more, many ORMs for example would likely have issues with that. Of course changing the auth key is not something you will necessarily have to do from within your application, so that would be acceptable I think in this limited case."
