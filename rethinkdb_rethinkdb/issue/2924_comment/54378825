      "I'm sort of unhappy with this.  I think having a specific string that can't be an auth key and an error message explaining the convoluted reason why is a pretty bad smell.  I would strongly prefer `true` here, but if everyone else is happy with `\"<hidden>\"` I wouldn't kick up a huge fuss over it."
