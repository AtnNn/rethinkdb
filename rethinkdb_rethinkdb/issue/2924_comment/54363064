      "I think that either approach is reasonable, `<hidden>` is probably a bit better, since it's intended for human-readable purposes only. I think that this choice can be easily explained in the documentation, and will be blindingly obvious to anyone using the system after a quick glance at the docs or if they stumble on it themselves.\r\n\r\nAlso, agreed that the case of setting the auth key by varying or modifying your existing auth key is totally obscure (and I can't think of any other case that would pose a problem for `<hidden>`.)\r\n"
