      "From @Tryneus:\r\n\r\nWhen the rethinkdb python driver is installed, it should add a script for `rethinkdb-dump` as well as the others (mine are located in /usr/local/bin).  When you call `rethinkdb dump`, it attempts to run the script and pass the arguments down.  It is likely that the environment the server was run in doesn't include the correct $PATH variable.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround (until we know if it's a configuration problem), if `rethinkdb-dump` is in your environment's $PATH, you should be able to run it directly.  If not, you may be able to run `python -m rethinkdb._dump` instead."
