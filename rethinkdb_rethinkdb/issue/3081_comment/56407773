      "Looking at the .pkg BOM it seems that the problem is that the `/usr/local`, `/usr/local/share` and `/usr/local/share/rethinkdb` entries are incorrect (`/usr/local/bin` is correct):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ lsbom rethinkdb.pkg/Bom -p fMU -d\r\n.\tdrwx------ \troot\r\n./usr\tdrwx------ \troot\r\n./usr/local\tdrwx------ \troot\r\n./usr/local/bin\tdrwxr-xr-x \troot\r\n./usr/local/share\tdrwx------ \troot\r\n./usr/local/share/rethinkdb\tdrwx------ \troot\r\n./usr/local/share/rethinkdb/web\tdrwxr-xr-x \troot\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo anything that the installer creates along this path for us is going to get the wrong permissions (usually this is only going to be `/usr/local/share/rethinkdb`). All of the files look correct, so the only problem is those directories. I am tracing exactly where this goes wrong now."
