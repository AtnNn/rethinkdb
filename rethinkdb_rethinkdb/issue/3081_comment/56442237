      "I just discovered that, when creating directories, the `install` command only sets the given permission on the childmost directory. The permissions for other non-existent directories in the path are set according to the current umask.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should prefix `umask 022 && ` to the `install -d` rule in the makefile."
