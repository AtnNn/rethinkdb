      "At first I was going to say that /proc/version is basically universal, but then I remembered that we're planning an OS X port, which means no /proc for us.  (Actually, don't we use /proc in the stats collection, too?)\r\n\r\nI'm hesitant to start forking processes while we're crashing.  Why don't we just print the version number when we crash, like we do now, and fold this into the bug-report functionality?\r\n\r\nAlso, this sort of thing should really be encapsulated in a shell script rather than in C++ code.\r\n\r\nClosing and merging into Issue #41, unless anybody objects."
