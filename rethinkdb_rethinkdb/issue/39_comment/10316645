      "The first part of this is done (we now print out version strings before backtraces, along with the compiler used to compile it).\r\n\r\nIt sounds like we also want to make RethinkDB collect some data about its environment at startup.  Let's try to make a list of what we want to see before a backtrace:\r\n\r\n* The version of RethinkDB\r\n* The output of `uname -a`\r\n* The output of `df -T`\r\n\r\nIs there anything else?"
