      "1. I think the value of printing mount info is very questionable. It turns the message into a wall of text, and I don't see what useful information we can extract out of it.\r\n2. `cat /etc/issue` isn't portable -- for example, we'll be adding rpm support soon and beyond. This needs to be abstracted (if it isn't already) so it can work on all systems or at least degrade to \"can't determine the distro version\".\r\n3. `uname -a` is better than `/proc/version` -- the former exists everywhere, whereas the latter does not.\r\n\r\n"
