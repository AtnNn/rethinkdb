      "Personally, I would love to see a plugin system (very similar to that of Elasticsearch with the rivers) that would allow things like dumping the change feed directly into an AMPQ without the need for any sort of middleware. This would give the level of redundancy and scalability most (me included) are looking for in something like a change feed."
