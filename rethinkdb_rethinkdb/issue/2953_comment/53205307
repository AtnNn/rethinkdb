      "I talked with @coffeemug about this while working with some of the mq stuff. It seems like it'd be nice to have a way to name the changefeeds and have their buffers persist on the server. One of the difficulties that would need to be solved is that the buffers are held on the query server you connected to previously. So if you happened to connect to another query server the second time, there's no way to get at the buffered changes.\r\n\r\nFrom what I recall, this is \"something that feels like it needs to happen\", but there are some technical aspects that need to be thought out for it to work in a clustered environment.
