      "We discussed the API for this a little bit, and the way to implement this is to send an opaque token for a change back to the client. The client can then pass the token back to the server and get all the changes that happened since that token.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely something that needs to happen, though unfortunately I don't have an ETA on this since it's a non-trivial technical effort."
