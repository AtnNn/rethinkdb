      "@coffeemug I think another way then some sort of token is a key that i can use when connecting with a changefeed.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table().changes({\"name\":\"helloworld\"}).run(function() {})\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis way there can be some black magic under the hood so if i reconnect the cluster can find anyne that was keeping track of my changes and will figure out a way to move the changes to the new server  i am connecting to and then continy the feed from there and then there should be some sort of timeout and then there is the 100k max before it starts droping things this couldwork out okay."
