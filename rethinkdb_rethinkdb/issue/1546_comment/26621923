      "Here are my thoughts on this:\r\n\r\n* Adding a semaphore to limit the number of concurrent tables being processed sounds like a good idea and is relatively easy to do. I think we should definitely do that.\r\n* Batching will be done soon by @mlucy and should help a lot so we don't have to worry about it in the export script.\r\n* The temp directory/renaming sounds like a good idea, I think we should do that.\r\n* I wouldn't worry about wrapper script to check for OOM snipes. I think the other changes should be more than sufficient."
