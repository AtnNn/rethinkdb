      "@Tryneus -- a couple of questions:\r\n\r\n* Do progress bars still work? Last time I was around your desk I thought you ran into some problem with them.\r\n* We don't have to detect OOM kills, we just need to print an error if a connection was closed prematurely (before the export tool could read through the entire cursor and get to the end). Do we do that? Is that difficult?"
