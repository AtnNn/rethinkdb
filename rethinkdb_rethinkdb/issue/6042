        "The RethinkDB version is 2.3.4, and I imported around 1.5M json objects to one table, and each object has around 20 fields. When I created 10 indexes for the table and then started loading the json file, a very strange issue is the RethinkDB was eating storage quickly, there was about 50G got fulled, and I have to stop the data loading. But when I loaded the json data into the table without those indexes, the rethinkdb generated a table file around 1.2G, and then I created the 10 indexes for the table, the final table file size is about 3.3 G.\r\n\r\nWhy is the result so different? 50G vs 3.3G..., Is there any issues at there? Thanks.\r\n\r\nC_ommand Line in Linux Server:\r\nrethinkdb import -c server:port -f mydata.json --table mydb.\"mytable\" --force --max-document-size 500000000"
