      "So, the first one is a bug.  Without has just been broken; this needs to go into a point release.  (I rolled it into review 704 since it's like a one-line change.)\r\n\r\nThe second one (`CLIENT ERROR: FUNC variables must be a *literal* array of numbers.`) is a little trickier, though.  We need to know the numbers in FUNC's first argument at compile-time so that we can turn them into a location in memory.  (Same with the argument to VAR.)  We can't do arbitrary code evaluation at compile-time, which is why they're currently restricted to literal datum numbers, but we could conceivably make an exception for `r.json`.  I'd have to think about that."
