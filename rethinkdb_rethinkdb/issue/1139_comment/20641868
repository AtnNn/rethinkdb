      "So, in this particular case it was a use-after-free bug that only got exposed because `r.json` is more complicated.\r\n\r\nIn general, it should be fine almost everywhere, although we only use it in the rb/py/js drivers to speed up inserts.\r\n\r\nWe have some documentation in the .proto file specifying what has to be specified explicitly rather than with a term that evaluates to the value, but it seems to be drastically out of date."
