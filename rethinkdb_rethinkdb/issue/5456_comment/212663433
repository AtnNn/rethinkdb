      "@ntquyen Are the \"Rejected a connection from server\" messages still repeating endlessly though? A few of these log entries are normal, especially if the servers are reachable through multiple addresses (e.g. one IPv6 and one IPv4 address). But they should stop once a connection has been established.\r\n\r\nI think `15f81be4-d716-4242-be1e-fb9237bf706f` might have been a so called peer ID which is different from the \"server ID\" that has the form \"proxy-...\". We used to print the peer ID in the \"Connected to proxy\" message. We changed this message recently to print the server ID as well in order to be less confusing and more useful. I forgot if we did this change in 2.2.6 or only in 2.3.0 (looks like it was in 2.3.0 based on your logs).\r\n\r\nIt's odd that the peer ID would be the same though for two proxies. Maybe both \"Connected to proxy\" messages are actually referring to the same proxy?\r\n\r\nIgnoring the log messages, is everything else working fine with your setup?"
