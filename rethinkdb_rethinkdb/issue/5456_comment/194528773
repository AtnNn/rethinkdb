      "@vyerukon Thanks for letting us know. The logic around this was changed a bit in RethinkDB 2.2.5, so upgrading might fix this for you. It's also worth noting that occasionally seeing this message after a temporary disconnect is normal (note that it's only an \"info\", not a warning or error).\r\n\r\nThe weird thing that this bug is about is that it keeps on happening over an extended period of time."
