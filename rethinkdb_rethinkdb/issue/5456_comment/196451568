      "Thanks for the additional info @ntquyen .\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with bonding NICs. Does that mean that the server has two different IP addresses (which should be fine)? Or is this below the IP level?\r\n\r\nRegarding the proxies: In the test with 10 proxies, are you running all of them on the same container, or each one in a separate container?\r\n\r\nI think we currently don't print the proxy ID anywhere. I opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5515 to address this in a future release."
