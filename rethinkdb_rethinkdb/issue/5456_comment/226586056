      "@erikdubbelboer The node being unable to reconnect and the warnings being printed even though the node isn't currently connected is concerning. That sounds like there's some race condition in our code.\r\nYou can probably work-around the issue for the moment by restarting the other servers in the cluster.\r\nOnce the cluster is back up, could you also email me the output of `r.db('rethinkdb').table('server_status')` to daniel@rethinkdb.com? That might help us to figure out if this issue is somehow related to the network or server configuration.\r\n\r\n@ddombrow Thanks for sending over the server output. It looks unsuspicious on first look."
