      "Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier about this @ntquyen .\r\n\r\nIt looks like @ddombrow also can still see this issue (as reported in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5862 ). Maybe we can find something that yours and his configuration have in common.\r\n\r\n@ddombrow what is the type of network you are running on, and how is it configured? Are there any firewalls, routers etc. in between the servers? Do the servers have multiple network interfaces, IP addresses and/or host names that they are available under?\r\n\r\n@ntquyen @ddombrow could you each email me the output of `r.db('rethinkdb').table('server_status')` from the affected clusters? My email address is daniel@rethinkdb.com ."
