      "Thanks for the update @ntquyen .\r\nI was able to get this message in a quick test after a heartbeat timeout, but it stops quickly for me once the servers are fully connected again (that behavior is pretty much expected with the current implementation).\r\nIs it still printing the message continuously for you @ntquyen ?\r\n\r\nTo find the timestamp of the heartbeat timeout, you can grep the RethinkDB log file. You'll find it in the RethinkDB data folder of that node (or in a different location in case you explicitly specified another log file path)."
