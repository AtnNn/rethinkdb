      "We found that in some network configurations, servers attempt to connect to another server via a loopback address and then end up connecting to themselves instead. This used to be ignored, but in recent versions generates the \"Rejected a connection from server ... since one is open already\" message.\r\n\r\nThis isn't actually harmful, other than adding unnecessary noise to the logs.\r\n\r\nThe problem will eventually be fixed by https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/5720 , but we might ship a smaller patch for 2.3.x before that."
