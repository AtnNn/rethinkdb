      "@danielmewes Sorry for late reply, I keep getting that error. And yes, for more than 24 hours. One thing to note that on instance is running on a CoreOS node that uses bonding NIC, mode 0 (round robin) in front of two physical NICs. And every one in a few days, one physical NIC is down and up for a ~1 minute."
