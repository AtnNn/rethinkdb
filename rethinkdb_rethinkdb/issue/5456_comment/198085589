      "I've finally been able to reproduce this thanks to some additional info from @ntquyen .\r\n\r\nI can trigger the described behavior by:\r\n1. Starting two servers, say with `-o 0 -j localhost` and `-o 1 -j localhost`\r\n2. Starting a proxy with two `-j` parameters: `-o 2 -j localhost -j localhost:29016`\r\n3. Shutting down the proxy and restarting it with the same parameters again"
