      "In the help slack channel, @rosskukulinski had a similar issue (repeated \"rejected connection ... because one is open already\", bad connectivity inside the cluster) when running RethinkDB inside Kubernetes; Kubernetes has a complex networking system and ends up with each `rethinkdb` process on its own dynamically allocated IP (different from the node's IP), in addition to many other IPs.\r\n\r\nHe was able to solve it by setting the `canonical-address` config setting to the IP that was supposed to be accessible by the other cluster members."
