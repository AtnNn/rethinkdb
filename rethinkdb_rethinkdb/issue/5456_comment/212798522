      "@danielmewes  When I restart the server, it runs well without any `Rejected a connection...` warning, but after about 10 - 15min, the warning appears and keep printing endlessly, 3-4 times per second.\r\n\r\nThe cluster is running fine, but I really concern that warning could affect the connection between nodes in cluster. I'm also facing the issue Heartbeat timeout while the cluster (of 3 nodes) is stress (read/write continuously for 1 or 2 hours, high CPU usage, 100% cache used). But may be our internal network is not stable, that could make Heartbeat timeout is more likely to happen when cluster is stressing."
