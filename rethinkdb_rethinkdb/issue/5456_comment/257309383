      "We were seeing this on 2.3.5. I finally fixed the issue by realizing that one of our servers was having issues (couldn't stop services etc), so I killed the rethinkdb instance there. That solved the issue.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it seems a misbehaving server was refusing to connect to the new server and thus brought the cluster into partial connectivity."
