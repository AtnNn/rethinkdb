      "@danielmewes That's correct, the bonding NIC is load balancing (round robin) between 2 physical NICs which each has different IP, it just works the same as normal NIC (though I'm not sure if it's exactly the same) This is the related documentation I followed: https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/network-config-with-networkd.html\r\n\r\nFor the proxies, I'm running it inside each kubernetes pod, along with a microservice that it serves requests. For example, I have microservice A and a rethinkdb proxy running in a same kubernetes pod so that A can connect to the proxy via `localhost:28015`. And I have ~20 pods like that.\r\n\r\n@encryptio Thanks for your response. However my rethinkdb cluster is outside kubernetes. I used to put it inside kubernetes, but i was very painful, simply setting `canonical-address` can make it work, yes, but the performance is very poor. And I don't see any benefit to put it inside k8s after all."
