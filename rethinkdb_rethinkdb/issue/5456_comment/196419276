      "@danielmewes Another notice I've just discovered: I have a bunch of rethinkdb proxies joined to ther cluster and in everyone of those, their `log_file` is constantly printing `info: Rejected a connection from server `[server-id]` since one is open already.` The `server-id`s are not listed in table `server_config` so I guess they are ids of the proxies. I can replicate the issue easily in different CoreOS environments: Run one-server rethinkdb cluster, and have about 10 rethinkdb proxies joining to the cluster. Check their log_file. \r\n\r\nAll inside docker container.\r\n\r\nOne question: where can I find the rethinkdb proxy id? I can't find it in the `log_file`"
