        "I noticed that to access a nested attribute in `orderBy` we pass a function, but to do it in `groupBy` we pass a nested json object. That seems inconsistent to me (I first tried to pass a function to groupBy, realized I can't, and then tried to pass a nested object and it worked).\n\nUnless I'm missing some subtlety, I think we should pass functions to `groupBy` instead, since that would allow a strict superset of operations and would be more consistent.\n\nI have two questions about this:\n- Am I missing some subtlety?\n- Is this change doable for 1.8 early next week?\n\nPinging @jdoliner.\n\n(Putting in 1.8-required for now).\n"
