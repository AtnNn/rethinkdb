      "Hello @anatol \r\n\r\nCompiling things with Google Closure is definitely something we are going to do, but before that we would need to do (at least?) two things\r\n- Merge some tests for the web interface in next\r\n- Compile the JavaScript driver.\r\n\r\nThe second point is more tricky. I did successfully compile the JavaScript driver with Google Closure and the flag ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS, but I had to do a few sed commands before on the CoffeeScript output and somehow I am not sure what wasn't following Closure's rules.\r\n\r\nI think once the JavaScript driver is stable (when all the new RQL methods will be done -- something like 3 weeks?), we could start to look again at Google Closure (or whatever other compiler -- but from my experience, the most efficient one is Google Closure).\r\n"
