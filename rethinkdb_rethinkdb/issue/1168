        "Currently our joins completely model SQL joins and return proper cross products. The resulting data can be painful for people to manipulate. However, we have the opportunity to make join operations more nosql-y -- instead of returning a cross product we can give the option to take all the rows from the right table, concat them into an array, and merge the array into the relevant row in the left table. This would be much nicer for users to manipulate.\n\nWe don't have to do it soon, so putting it in backlog for now. We can do it along with #1152 when we get around to it.\n"
