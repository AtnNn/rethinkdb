      "Probably we would have to (possibly implicitly) denote a default data directory for each server, and then specify alternate locations for some set of `db`/`table`/`shard`s. The more of those we offer the more complicated the UI is going to be (as well as the underlying system), but the more scenarios we are going to cover:\r\n\r\n- `db` - this would make multi-tennant setups better (with some nasty quota issues)\r\n- `table` - probably the most useful for many setups\r\n- `shard` - more valuable if you could specify shard boundaries in \r\n\r\nSo each server would have to have things specified as their disk layouts would be different, so this would involve some setup from people. There is some real thinking about where the metadata files would have to live, since there are potential issues both at startup, and atomicity issues with a disk suddenly unmounting."
