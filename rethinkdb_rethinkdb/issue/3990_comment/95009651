      "Currently time-limited queries have a target latency of 125ms for the first batch and 500ms for all subsequent batches, and in practice you get up to ~25-75ms above that.\r\n\r\nI'm reasonably sure we should reduce the first batch latency; it makes things feel much faster in the REPL and it barely hurts throughput at all.  I'm less sure we should reduce the latency for subsequent batches, but half a second is pretty long; we should consider maybe halving that."
