      "That sounds complicated. My opinion is that changing the batching scheme for later batches isn't worth it. In most cases the latency there doesn't matter, and we shouldn't risk performance in common production cases (usually: all data has to be loaded anyway) to make rare interactive cases feel slightly snappier.\r\nHow often do we think users click \"load more data\" in the Data Explorer? I imagine this is rather rare (I've close to never done it). Am I missing other scenarios where those latencies matter?\r\n\r\nReducing the first batch latency sounds ok."
