      ">  rethinkdb not have the option \"open.db\" of mongodb\r\n\r\nYou basically use RethinkDB driver like so:\r\n```\r\nr.connect({...}, function(error, client) {\r\n  if (error) {\r\n    // handle error\r\n  } else {\r\n    // client is connection object\r\n    // here goes your mega-cycle\r\n    r.db(\"test\").table(\"test\").insert({\"name\": \"value\"}).run(client, function (error) {\r\n      // some operations\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo r.connect *is* open.db, it just works slightly differently. Open one connection and use it for db operations with connection object you got into your callback, then close it after you're done. Personally I use node-pool to simplify my life and boost performance.\r\n\r\nYou should ask such questions on IRC channel, mailing lists or StackOverflow, and this is clearly not a bug."
