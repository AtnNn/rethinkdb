      "Ok, the new stress client has been approved and merged into next.  It provides workloads for each of the above traffic types.  You run one invocation of the stress client for each traffic type, telling it how many clients, how many total ops/sec, and how many ops to do before creating a new connection.  See test/rdb_workloads/README for a more in-depth description and some examples.\r\n\r\nThe stress client will then output on stdout the timestamp and latency of each operation when it completes, as well as any errors that occurred.  When interrupted, the stress client will shut down and print a summary of the number of operations run and their average latency (on stderr, to not confuse anyone parsing the latency numbers on stdout)."
