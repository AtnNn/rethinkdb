      "It should, but doesn't, but that is probably due to how it's handled on the server - it isn't put into the term tree with the rest of the query, but it is instead rewritten to a literal value before we run the query.\r\n\r\nIt's entirely possible that `r.now` used to check the arity and I screwed it up when I rewrote that code a few months back.  Either way, it should be a simple fix.\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting this, @webmasterkai, and glad to help!"
