      "I modeled that after Python's `requests` library. They pick it as a default and people seem to like it. Here is their explanation (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/authentication/):\r\n\r\n> Many web services that require authentication accept HTTP Basic Auth. This is the simplest kind, and Requests supports it straight out of the box. In fact, HTTP Basic Auth is so common that Requests provides a handy shorthand for using it.\r\n\r\nBy \"shorthand\", they mean it's the default. I think it's a good idea and it's trivial for the user to change. Are you strongly opposed to it?"
