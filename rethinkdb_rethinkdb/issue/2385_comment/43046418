      "What happens if I try to pull data from rotten tomatoes with the default auth set to basic.\r\n\r\nIt seems like setting the default auth to basic is like over-fitting the case of pulling data from GitHub.\r\n- `wget` and `curl` don't set the default auth type to basic\r\n- There are also quite a lot of API that don't use such authentication system\r\n\r\nIs it really a good idea to have the default auth type set to basic?"
