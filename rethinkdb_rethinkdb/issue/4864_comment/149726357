      "@brunoalano: if you are restricting the YAML format, then we already have a parser that I wrote in the codebase that would handle what I see there. Take a look at [test/common/parsePolyglot.py](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/test/common/parsePolyglot.py). I would be open to some changes in that parser if you needed it (as well as relocation into the Python driver)."
