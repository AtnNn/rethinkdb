      "@brunoalano Sounds good. If you run `make` in the `drivers/python` directory that will build the Python driver in `build/drivers/python`.\r\n\r\nI think you need to apply some extra tricks to run _impory.py directly without installing the driver, since the way it tries to import the driver doesn't work outside of a package. I'm not too familiar with the exact modifications necessary for doing that, but it shouldn't be too hard.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can run `make sdist` instead of just `make` in the `driver/python` directory. That will create a `.tar.gz` file in `build/packages/python` that you can install through `pip` (ignore the version number, it's still set to 1.16 on `next`). After it's installed, you can run the import script through `rethinkdb-import`."
