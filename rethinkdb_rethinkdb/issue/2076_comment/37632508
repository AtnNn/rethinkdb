      "Up in review 1317 assigned to @mglukhovsky \r\nBranch michel_2076_new_type\r\n\r\nI tested it with the docs generated from the branch `michel_group_polish_index` and it works fine.\r\n\r\nBasically we consider a \"grouped_stream\" as a \"stream/array\".\r\nWe started to track if we were in a `grouped_stream/grouped_data` since #2054 and we are using it to decide whether we should display `ungroup` or not.\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky I you want to test it, you have to:\r\n- checkout `michel_group_polish_index` in the docs repo\r\n- in `_scripts`, run `python dataexplorer.py`\r\n- Copy `reql_docs.json` in the rethinkdb repo in `docs/rql`\r\n- Run `make`\r\n\r\nOr I can show you the result, it's probably going to be easier."
