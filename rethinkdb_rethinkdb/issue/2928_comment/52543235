      "Hi, I don't have access to my server for a while, so I'll answer what I can and fill in the rest later;\r\n\r\nI only installed rethinkdb 2 weeks ago straight from your website, so I think I'm running the latest version but will confirm later\r\n\r\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04 server with all updates installed and very little custom software\r\n\r\nI'm using rotational storage running on a VPS. Not sure what kind of storage they're using in terms of RAID or disk speeds, but I know I'm not the only person using this disk/array of disks.\r\n\r\nSorry I can't provide more details right now"
