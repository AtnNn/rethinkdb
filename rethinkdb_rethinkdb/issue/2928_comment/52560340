      "@JOE95443 thank you for the information. We've just released RethinkDB 1.13.4 and I recommend updating to that version as a first step.\r\n\r\nCan you send us a copy of the table files (rethinkdb_data directory) when this happens the next time? Just tar/gzip the whole directory. It should compress pretty well. Once you have the file, let us know and @mglukhovsky can set up a secure upload page for it.\r\nI would like to take a look at the file to see how exactly it is corrupted."
