      "Hi @JOE95443,\r\nthank you for the issue report. I have a few more questions about your setup:\r\n* Which version of RethinkDB are you running?\r\n* Which version of Linux (or is this on OS X?)? What's the output of `uname -a`?\r\n* Are you using SSD or rotational storage?\r\n* Which file system is the RethinkDB data on? Are you using any special mount options?\r\n* Is this running in a virtual or virtualized machine?\r\n\r\nWe are about to ship a couple of fixes with RethinkDB 1.13.4 in the next days, though at this point I cannot say whether those will fix this problem as well or if this is something different."
