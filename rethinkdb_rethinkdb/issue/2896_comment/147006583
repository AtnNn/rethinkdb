      "@pires That's theoretically possible. Rebalancing a table still causes a brief interruption in availability, so we would have to be a bit careful about when to perform that operation and when to enable it in the first place.\r\n\r\nOne option that can be done right now is to monitor the `doc_count_estimates` field in `table.info()` using a separate script, and to issue a `table.rebalance()` whenever the counts become too uneven. Once we have support for plugins (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4785), this could very easily become one."
