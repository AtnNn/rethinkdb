      "@ilsken -- thanks for the suggestion! You can already do this in RethinkDB manually (very much similarly to how you'd do it in Mongo -- by copying old data into an archive table), but I agree that it would be really neat to support archive functionality out of the box.\r\n\r\nTagging as feature and moving to 2.x for now. We should discuss this along with other issues in #1911 to see if it impacts our cluster overhaul design."
