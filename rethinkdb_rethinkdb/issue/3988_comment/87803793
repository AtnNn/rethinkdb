      "@danielmewes CORS is pretty easy (it's pretty much just an extra `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header, which allows you to read the response with an XMLHttpRequest, even if it's cross-origin). If your server is written with Express, the [ach](https://github.com/stuartpb/ach) middleware is a simple one-line way to enable it.\r\n\r\nGetting the JSON using Ajax with CORS would circumnavigate this issue (as there are no protocol security restrictions on XHR the way there are for script inclusions)."
