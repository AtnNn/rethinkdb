      "@stuartpb Does the warning go away if you disable update checking in the web UI?\r\n(click on the gear icon between \"Logs\" and the \"Search\" box)\r\n\r\nIn the long term we should get rid of the update check in the UI and instead use the information from the server's update checking mechanism.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I don't know anything about CORS. Is that easy to use? Would it avoid the issue for now?\r\n\r\nThis is also related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3489"
