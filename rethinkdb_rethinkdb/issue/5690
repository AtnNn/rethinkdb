        "Hola,\n\nI think this PR will fix #5439 and fix #5660 for the Java driver.\n\nThe core of the bug is described here: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5660#issuecomment-210734741\n\nThe crux of the issue is that only `IOException` is being handled. If another exception type was thrown, the `ResponsePump` thread exceptionally exit without clean up and without notifying cursor changefeeds causing what looks like a stalled changefeed upon a server restart.\n\nI'm not sure how I could write a unit test for this particular issue since it would require restarting the RethinkDB server :electric_plug: during a unit test.\n\nAll unit tests pass (except a few string tests). Probably because some M$ Windowz string quirks?\n"
