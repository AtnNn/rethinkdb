      "@AmeenAli One small problem with it is that it would be inconsistent with the other command line arguments `rethinkdb` takes, such as `--help`, `--cache-size` etc.\r\nWe could make those case-insensitive as well, but that would definitely be at odds with other Unix commands then.\r\n\r\nSome Unix tools even assign different meanings to certain single-letter arguments depending on whether they are in lower or upper case.\r\nFor example GNU `ls`:\r\n```\r\n-c     with  -lt:  sort  by, and show, ctime (time of last modification of file status information) with -l: show ctime and sort by name otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first\r\n\r\n-C     list entries by columns\r\n```\r\n"
