      "If this is a matter of personal preference, a cookie would be sufficient. We would also have to think about how much of the UI you'd be allowed to recolor.\r\n\r\nIf this is intended to reliably distinguish a production vs development cluster, we would probably have to store it in the system cluster configuration, which would definitely require additional work.\r\n\r\nWould it be sufficient if we allowed adding a brightly colored tag to the header of the web UI that allows custom text / color? (e.g. _development_ or _production_)"
