      "Also, we've discussed the possibility of adding a \"cluster ID\" to make it hard for users to accidentally connect two clusters together. We could also use the cluster ID to solve this problem. If we display the cluster ID at the top of the web UI, then users could set it to \"development\" or \"production\" or whatever. Another option would be to choose a color scheme for the web UI by hashing the cluster ID, so different clusters would automatically each have their own color scheme. (But we probably won't implement cluster IDs for a few months at least, so it's not an immediate solution.)"
