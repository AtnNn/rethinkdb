      "Thank you for your suggestion @mkleehammer .\r\n\r\nIt sounds useful. By \"sidebar\" you mean the bar at the top of the console right (the one that displays the server currently being connected to, the number of issues, number of servers and the number of tables)?\r\n\r\nProbably the easiest way for implementing and using this would be by having an option in the \"Web UI Settings\". The ones you get by clicking on the small gear between \"Logs\" and the \"Search\" field at the top of the UI. Currently those settings get stored in a cookie, which makes the implementation much easier.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage would be that if you connect to say a production server from a different computer, through a different URL, or with a different browser, it would again appear in the default colors since the cookie won't be found.\r\n\r\nA more complex but probably better solution would be storing the color in the `r.db('rethinkdb').table('cluster_config')` table. This would require an extension to the server code to store and synchronize this setting across nodes in the cluster. Depending on how commonly this feature is going to be used, it has the disadvantage that it adds clutter to the configuration table. It might be worth it though.\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky what is your opinion on this?"
