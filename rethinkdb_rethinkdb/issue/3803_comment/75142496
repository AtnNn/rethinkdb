      "I'll try those.  I had tried setting machine-name in the config file but it did not affect the host name.  (I started with server-name like the docs but the 1.15 server reported it did not know this setting.)\r\n\r\nSince I assume these techniques work should this be closed?  I think a color would be useful long-term addition - it is much more obvious than text, particularly if you reserve bright colors only for production.  For example, one app I am using has a red navbar if node_env-production and the login is marked as a developer.  "
