      "You could use the cookie to identify development machines (e.g. with a green color). That way you know to be careful when the UI appears in the default color. I agree though that it's not quite ideal.\r\n\r\nLike @timmaxw said you can override the RethinkDB server name manually through the system table or even through the instance configuration file in `/etc/rethinkdb/instandces.d/...` by adding a `server-name=PROD_...` line to the file.\r\n... or try what @chrisvariety suggested and set the host name through AWS.\r\n\r\nWould one of those options work for you?\r\n\r\nI think the color coding would still be more visible, but is definitely more work to implement."
