      "I think the cookie would actually be worse since it would sometimes be red (or whatever you choose) but not if you clear your cache or use a different machine.  If the purpose is to identify production, having an indicator that is *sometimes* there would make matters worse.\r\n\r\nThe host name works ok but when there are multiple machines on AWS or one some other system where hostnames are out of our control and look random it isn't quite as helpful."
