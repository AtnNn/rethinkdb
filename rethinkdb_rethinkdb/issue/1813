Create a cluster of two machines (one per datacenter).\r\n2. Create a table, set one of the datacenters as primary, have a replica in each datacenter.\r\n3. Manufacture a netsplit.\r\n4. Turn off primary datacenter on one of the sides.\r\n5. Rejoin the machines.\r\n6. Try to do anything with primary datacenter setting on that table."
