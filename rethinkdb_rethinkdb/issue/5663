        "In GoRethink we read the `server_status` table to get the list of available servers when connecting and also create a changefeed on this table to ensure that the client always has the complete up-to-date list of servers. \r\n\r\nHowever in 2.3 with the addition of users this no longer works for non-admin users as it appears that it is not possible to grant read permission to non-admin users on system tables such as `server_status`. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"users\").grant(\"user\", {read: true})\r\n```\r\n```\r\nThe `rethinkdb` database is special, you can't grant permissions on it in\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that system tables should be protected but should the status tables also be protected from reading?"
