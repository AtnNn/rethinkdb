      "So I can reproduce this bug on newton too.\r\n\r\nI just need to create secondary indexes and call `indexStatus()` on the table.\r\n\r\nSo far, \r\n- just creating indexes doesn't seem to trigger this bug, \r\n- if indexes are built, I can't trigger the bug by calling `indexStatus()`\r\n\r\nThe indexes I created always map to an undefined key, so there was nothing in the secondary index."
