      "Yeah I think it's really splitting hairs to call this error message wrong. Reading it really tells me exactly what's wrong and I actually think it's much better to say specifically \"I got X but I wanted Y.\" than to start with something general like: \"This function only takes Xs and Ys. (You gave me an X and a Z)\""
