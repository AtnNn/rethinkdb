        "Hi folks\r\n\r\nApologies if RethinkDB already does this or has another solution, but looking at the drivers I couldn't see one. If I've issued a changefeed query for something and the driver is waiting for results, I think this means that the driver needs to keep polling the RethinkDB server. It would be great if the RethinkDB server could push changes to the driver, rather than having to keep polling for changes.\r\n\r\nIs this something that would be useful or possible?"
