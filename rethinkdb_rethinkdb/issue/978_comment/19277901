      "This would also give us an opportunity to negotiate an alternative protocol. Eventually, if we decided that protobuf's limitations are no longer acceptable, and we develop a new protocol (and that supports streaming, say) we could make protocol selection part of this handshake, which, thankfully, lies outside of the protobuf spec. I imagine we could also eventually implement versioning of the protobuf based protocol too with the same mechanism, allowing old drivers to work but with a warning about the deprecation of that version of the protocol."
