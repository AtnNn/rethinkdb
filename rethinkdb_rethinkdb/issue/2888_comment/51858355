      "Copied my response to @srh's comment from #2857:\r\n\r\nThat might be the right solution; I'm not sure. If we're trying to be consistent with `r.table_create()` and `r.table_drop()`, presumably we would allow `r.db(...).table_reconfigure()`; but in the discussion on #2680, Slava mentioned that seemed odd to him. Another possible problem is that the pseudo-tables `table_config` and `table_status` always present the name as `db.table`, no matter which DB the user is connected to. So I agree that my original proposal has a problem, but we should discuss this more."
