      "So, if we ever want to get this issue done, we should probably list specific array functions we also want to work on strings, otherwise this issue is too general. This is a fairly low priority now and I have lots to do so I don't want to spend time on this yet, but if anyone wants to take a crack at it, it would help move this along I think."
