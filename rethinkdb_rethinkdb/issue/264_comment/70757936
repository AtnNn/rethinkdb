      "I think we should implement `.count` for strings. It should count the number of Unicode characters, and not the number of bytes. Should be pretty easy now that @gchpaco has implemented UTF-8 support for `split`.\r\n`count` would be O(n) on strings, but I think that's fine.\r\n\r\nSimilarly I think `slice` would be useful, and it should be UTF-8 aware."
