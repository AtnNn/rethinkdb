      "Thanks for the additional info @elifarley .\r\nI think it is extremely similar to materialized views (unless I still misunderstand something). Materialized views would also be persistent and would be brought back up to date if a server was restarted.\r\n\r\nThe only difference I can see is that a materialized view would update the most recent time group every time the underlying data changes, and not only when the full hour / 10 minutes (in this example) have elapsed. So you will need to discard the count for the last group if you want to consider only completed time periods."
