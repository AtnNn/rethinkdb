      "I think having these terms return seconds is probably not a good idea, but that doesn't mean that it has to be impossible to do arithmetic with them.\r\n\r\nTheoretically we could add a `duration` type that's represented in terms of months, days, hours, minutes and/or seconds. We could then support adding a duration to a datetime in a way that uses the correct length of the month, day or hour.\r\nThe semantics of this might not be completely obvious though, and it could be a bit of a pain to implement.\r\n\r\nI'd like to keep this open, but I'll move it to `backlog` since I think it's not something that we want to do quickly and badly."
