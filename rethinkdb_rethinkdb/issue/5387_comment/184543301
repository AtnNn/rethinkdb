      "I vehemently disagree that we shouldn't worry about purity, quite the contrary, we should such that you don't have to. If treating a day as 86400 seconds is sufficient for you storing that number in a constant `day` and simply using `r.now().sub(day)` is just about as much effort as using `r.now().sub(r.day())`. However, someone expecting us to do the right, but tricky, thing would be sorely mistaken.\r\n\r\nIf we add this feature, given that it's possible to do right to begin with, we should do so and not cut corners."
