      "Or even, how many seconds in a day? Daylight savings time changes make that a surprisingly difficult question when you want to do arithmetic on times. Adding a \"day\" to a timestamp and having the time-of-day change would be what adding 86400 seconds would do across daylight savings time changes, which could be completely incorrect behavior in some use cases, and exporting constants like this makes it easy to mistake \"this time tomorrow\" with \"add one day to this time\".\r\n\r\n[Go's time library](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration) decides to only give `Duration` constants up to `Hour`, which is arguably less useful but also avoids some confusion."
