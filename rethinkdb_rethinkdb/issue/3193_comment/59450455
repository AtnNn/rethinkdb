      "It looks like this isn't that easy actually, since there doesn't appear to be a syscall for getting those numbers. Instead on Linux we would have to parse /proc/meminfo, or at least that's what people on the web are saying.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty important that we get this right though, since users will lose a lot of performance if their RethinkDB cache size is set to a value that's much too small."
