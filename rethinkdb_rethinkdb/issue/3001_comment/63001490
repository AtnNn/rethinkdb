      "@coffeemug: Currently `foreach()` makes assumptions about the format of the documents returned by the commands it's running. Perhaps we should redesign the return values of `table_create()` and `table.reconfigure()` so they're compatible with `foreach()`. Right now `foreach()` expects that the operations it's running should each return a document where all the values are numbers or arrays. So this is an example of a compatible format:\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    created: 1,\r\n    table_configs: [config]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd then if the user runs `seq.foreach(table_create(r.row))`, they would get something like:\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    created: 5,\r\n    table_configs: [config1, config2, config3, config4, config5]\r\n}\r\n```"
