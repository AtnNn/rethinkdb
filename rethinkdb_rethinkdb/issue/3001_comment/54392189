      "@coffeemug, I'm confused by your comment:\r\n\r\n* First you say we should special-case `db_create()` and `table_create()`, but then you give a query that doesn't seem to involve calling `db_create()` or `table_create()`.\r\n\r\n* What does `return_changes=True` give you that wasn't either in the `generated_keys` field or in the original document you inserted? I don't think it gives you anything. Even if we were to add some optional fields that got automatically filled in when you wrote to `table_config`, I think the current codebase would just return exactly what you inserted rather than what it got automatically changed to.\r\n\r\nBut the gist of your comment seems to be that the right way to do this is by doing #2870, which I think Michel and I agree with."
