      "Thanks for bringing this up again @andyburke (we had some prior discussions about this in another issue, I have to look up which one it was). This is indeed a convincing example for why we should strongly consider switching to semver for our driver. The reason for why we don't use it at the moment is to keep the driver versions similar to the corresponding server versions, so you can easily tell which driver works with which server.\r\n\r\nWe could use something like `23.0.0` instead of `2.3.0` maybe, or even `203.0.0` if we want to make sure that the version schema still works if we ever reach `2.10.x` for the server."
