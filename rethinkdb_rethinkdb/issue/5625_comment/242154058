      "I just wanted to add another quick note that there is another factor at play here \8211 having the same version shared across all client libs and the database itself is *extremely* useful. I know that elastica had such a problem with confusion from different versions that they're unifying everything in their stack under \"5.0\" shortly.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, semver is critical in client libraries, since it's obeyed by just about every popular package manager.\r\n\r\nPerhaps \"major\" numbers should be shared by the database and all clients (and increment any time a database API change is made, breaking or not); \"minor\" and \"patch\" numbers could then follow the semantics of semver for each client library, while the server is more or less constrained to `<major>.0.<patch>`.\r\n\r\nJust an idea."
