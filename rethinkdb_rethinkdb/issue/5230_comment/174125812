      "Someone else on IRC was asking about this error.\r\n\r\nI got a little too frustrated when I last tried fixing this issue. It might be possible instead, in the `./configure` script, to check if `npm` supports `--no-registry` and to automatically fetch it if not. It's not a good long-term solution but it would help anyone running into this issue."
