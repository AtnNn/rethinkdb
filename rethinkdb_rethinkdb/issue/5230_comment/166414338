      "@sreekaranugu That is an interesting bug. The RethinkDB build system has been using the `--no-registry` to npm, but your `npm` complains that \"ERR! registry URL is required\".\r\n\r\nYou should be able to work around that error by copying the `precompiled/` folder from the RethinkDB source distribution and re-running `./configure --allow-fetch`.\r\n\r\nOr as @danielmewes suggests, running `./configure --fetch npm --allow-fetch` might also work.\r\n\r\nThis issue might be fixed by rewriting the npm pkg scripts to copy files and use `npm rebuild` instead of using `npm install`."
