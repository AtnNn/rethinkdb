      "This is actually one of the bigger points in the static value sugar proposal (#343). There are a number of places in our query language where we want people to pass a mapping function but assume that most of the time this mapping function is just going to be a single attribute access so we give them a short hand way to do it with a string. This is kind of dumb though because you can easily have both. Since people basically never want to pass a constant function in these places we can just accept functions and treat strings as a special shorthand for `lambda x: x[string]`."
