      "@jdoliner, could you describe how you're doing this and what's involved? Specifically there are three questions currently in my mind (though there are probably more I'm not thinking of):\r\n\r\n* are we just going to store pkeys as the secondary index value (or rather, basically nothing, since it's already stored in the secondary index key) and then just look up documents by pkey?\r\n* are we going to use snapshotting in the cache to make this work, or some other mechanism?\r\n* also, there is a question of whether the copy-free implementation should be the only implementation, or one of two possible implementations controlled by a flag (MongoDB offers both an implementation that copies documents and one that requires an extra pkey lookup).\r\n\r\nI think this issue warrants some public discussion as it's a pretty big deal and the implementation tradeoffs will have significant product-y impacts that we should discuss.\r\n\r\n"
