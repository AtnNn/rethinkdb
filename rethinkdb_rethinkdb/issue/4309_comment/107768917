      "Thanks @bcantrill -- the CLA is definitely the most expedient path (but not the only one, if it's unworkable for you guys). FYI, all it does is signs off the copyright to these specific patches to RethinkDB. We included a lot of info in the CLA document on why that's necessary for us to operate effectively -- sorry if it causes too many inconveniences."
