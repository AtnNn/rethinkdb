      "This might be related to https://github.com/joyent/pkgsrc-joyent/blob/master/rethinkdb/patches/patch-mk_support_pkg_v8.sh, or something similar where it is trying to e.g. build a 64-bit binary where the GCC default is 32-bit, or vice-versa.  That's usually the cause of ELFCLASS failures.\r\n\r\nI also ensured that we used the system (pkgsrc) icu rather than building inline, which required this patch https://github.com/joyent/pkgsrc-joyent/blob/master/rethinkdb/patches/patch-external_v8__3.30.33.16_third__party_icu_icu.gyp\r\n\r\nBoth of these are specific to the pkgsrc environment though and aren't general purpose.
