      "Ok made some progress. Looks like the problem is that the V8 build system creates what's called a \"thin\" archive, which gld then doesn't accept (not sure if that's because of the missing `file` magic, or due to a different reason). http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25554621/turn-thin-archive-into-normal-one shows how to convert the `.a` files."
