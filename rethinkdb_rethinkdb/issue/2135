        "Right now we have too much pointer chasing in counted_t<datum_t>.  For example, to access the k'th element of a datum that is an array, we'd write (informally) `x->r_array->std_vector_ptr_[k]`.  That's three indirections.  We could make that be two indirections with a variant_ptr type and one indirection with a wire_vector_t pointee for that.\r\n\r\nI've implemented a variant_ptr type (a pointer version of boost::variant) before and could do it easily (with template metaprogramming checks that all the times are unique).  It would be a counted_variant_ptr in this case."
