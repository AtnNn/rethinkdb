      "I don't think that this is being deleted, since there is no code for that. Rather I think that this error is being prompted by the combination of:\r\na) that file is actually a symlink to a file `../../../build/drivers/ruby/ql2.pb.rb`\r\nb) with the failure in #2403 this file is never being created\r\n\r\nWith your system in this state can you verify for me that the symlink file still exits?\r\n\r\nI also wonder if we should have a symlink to the build directory there, but have to ask around to see if I am missing something there."
