      "So just aliasing wouldn't be quite enough, since `arr.forEach` passes a different set of arguments to the callback, including an index. It also accepts an optional second argument `thisArg` that's used to set `this` when executing the callback, which we don't have in `each`.\r\n\r\nIt still sounds like it would be fairly easy to do, and sounds like a really good idea."
