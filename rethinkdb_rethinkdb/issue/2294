        "Running RethinkDB 1.12.3 with a 500 MiB cache.\r\n\r\nI inserted 4'000'000 small (< 200 B) documents into a single table. Running `tbl.sample(1)` 100x concurrently causes the memory to go from 871 MiB to over 2 GiB.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, the idle server does not seem to free any memory. But running a single `tbl.sample(1)` query frees 20 MiB, and running it multiple times keeps lowering the amount of used memory (as seen in the RES column in htop) from 1970M to 1949M to 1922M.\r\n\r\nIf I run no more queries for 20 minutes it stays at 1922M. Running the query again lowers the memory usage to 1895M."
