      "@karlgrz This is still expected behavior today. You can somewhat speed it up, by doing\r\n```\r\nr.db('my_db_name').table('my_table_name').delete({durability: \"soft\"});\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can speed it up a lot by dropping the table and recreating it (though you'll have to re-create your replication/sharding configuration and secondary indexes of course)."
