      "I just tried running the following query on a table with approximately 5 million records:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.db('my_db_name').table('my_table_name').delete();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt timed out. Am I correct that this is the expected behavior? Or should this be a fast operation?\r\n\r\nCluster topology: 3 nodes, this table only replicated onto a single node without sharding."
