      "This is part of the user-facing interface so I'd lean towards leaving it alone unless there's a strong reason to change it.\r\n\r\nThe situation where `all_replicas_ready` is `false` but all the replicas report `ready` won't last very long in general, right? I'm not sure if that's a big enough problem to justify changing it.\r\n\r\nBut I don't feel strongly about this and I would be OK either way."
