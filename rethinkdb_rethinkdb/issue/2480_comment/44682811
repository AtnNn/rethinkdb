      "I wrote this after a conversation with @Tryneus. I came away with the mistaken assumption that the conversion to JSON had not been done for the Python driver. It turns out that only the build system was broken on that count. I am just completing the changes in the build system so that there is no dependency now.\r\n\r\nAnd I re-named this issue to reflect the actual issue."
