Without stack trace and wrong error message it was a matter of guessing which was the function with the missing argument.\n\nFrom the docs - `array.changeAt(index, value) \8594 array`. There are only two arguments for this function ofc if I'm not missing something else because I'm still really new to rethinkdb.\n"
