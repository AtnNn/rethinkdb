        "`rdb_unittest` is often used when tests have to modify the cluster (e.g.: kill a node), but there are enough cases where only a single server is used, and it remains intact for the whole test (e.g.: `connections/r_http.py`). It would be nice if those tests could use the external server provided by `test-runner` rather than spinning up their own."
