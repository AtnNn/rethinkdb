        "After talking with @timmaxw, it sounds like right now if you change which replica is the master, existing changefeeds on the old master won't be disconnected, so we'll have changefeeds on a replica, which we haven't thought about.\r\n\r\nWe probably want to support this at some point, for live resharding if nothing else.  After a brief talk with @timmaxw it sounds like it might be sufficient to just guarantee that changefeeds are disconnected if the replica and the master can't reach each other."
