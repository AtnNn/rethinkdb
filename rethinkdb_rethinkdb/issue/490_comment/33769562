      "I want to get the integrations tests to run again and consistently pass. Ideally I will be able to:\r\n\r\n- Refactor the python test framework (scenarios and workloads) to make it even easier to use (I still don't know if that's possible, @timmaxw and @Tryneus did a really good job)\r\n- Convert the polyglot tests to use that framework, and act as workloads (The current scripts are very erratic: #674, #706, #968, #711, #668, #616, #1402)\r\n- Convert the memcache workloads into reql workloads, which would fix #1524 and would remove the need for keeping the memcache protocol on the server (#803)\r\n- Maybe add some features to rethinkdb that would help make the tests more reliable (#1884, #1912, #1927, #511)\r\n- Add some missing tests: #745, #537, #1654, #441, #384 and modern interface tests for the web ui\r\n- Repair or remove every broken test (#1374, #1525)\r\n- Automatically test next every night\r\n- Make the tests easier to run manually\r\n\r\nI have started work on this in the `atnnn/490` branch."
