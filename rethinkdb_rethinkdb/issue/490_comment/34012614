      "That all sounds wonderful.\r\n\r\nAs part of porting the polyglot tests, could we make it so that regression tests for server behavior are written directly in one of the three languages rather than going through yaml and the polyglot test framework?  Some types of tests would be an order of magnitude less painful to write in that case."
