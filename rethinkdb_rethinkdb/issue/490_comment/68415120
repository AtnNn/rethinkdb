      "I am going to close this both because much of it is stale or completed, and because there is little point to a very generic umbrella issue like this. Minus a 3 points that are too vague to be addressed everything is covered. Here is the checklist from above:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] ~~Refactor the python test framework (scenarios and workloads) to make it even easier to use (I still don't know if that's possible, @timmaxw and @Tryneus did a really good job)~~ *too vague*\r\n- [ ] Convert the polyglot tests to use that framework, and act as workloads (The current scripts are very erratic):\r\n  - [ ] #674 Polyglot tests should clear out `run` directory occasionally\r\n  - [x] #706 Polyglot tests fail with `OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory` if `build/release/rethinkdb` does not exist\r\n  - [x] #968 Broken test: Database `test` already exists.\r\n  - [x] #711 Some of the driver tests test the installed driver\r\n  - [x] #668 The ql-js-connect test occasionally fails on travis \r\n  - [x] #616 When running the regression-659 test, the stress client fails with `Unable to read from socket: Success\r\n  - [x] #1402 Make reql tests not be so unfriendly \r\n- [x] Convert the memcache workloads into reql workloads\r\n  - [x] fix #1524 serial_mix memcached workload fails because append/prepend is broken \r\n  - [x] #803 Remove internal memcache protocol, dummy protocol, templatization of clustering layer.\r\n- [x] Maybe add some features to rethinkdb that would help make the tests more reliable:\r\n  - [x] ~~#1884 Listen on Unix Domain Sockets~~ *no testing impact*\r\n  - [x] #1912 Support --client-port in release mode \r\n  - [x] #1927 Using a single, system-generated source port for cluster connections \r\n  - [x] #511 RethinkDB should never return HTTP code 500 (Internal Server Error) without writing a more detailed message to the log \r\n- [ ] Add some missing tests:\r\n  - [ ] #745 Add connection tests for Ruby \r\n  - [ ] ~~#537 Add an import integration test.~~ *duped to #2598*\r\n  - [ ] #1654 Test how a cluster responds to partial node failures\r\n  - [x] #441 We should test that the new protobuf well-formedness-checker actually catches malformed protobufs.\r\n  - [x] ~~#384 ReQL testing todo~~ *obsolete*\r\n  - [x] ~~modern interface tests for the web ui~~ *too vague*\r\n- [x] Repair or remove every broken test\r\n  - [x] #1374 Resurrect cluster tests \r\n  - [x] #1525 \"restart\" test scenario does not work \r\n- [x] Automatically test next every night\r\n- [x] ~~Make the tests easier to run manually~~ *too vague*"
