      "We should always include the original javascript error verbatim in any message we return. This enables people to easily google the problem.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer to avoid parsing the error string to determine if it is the parens issue or not. There are several points at which catch errors in JS execution including a separate point where any syntax errors are reported. We could simply append a hint (similar to \"did you forget a return?\") to any syntax error reminding people that parens are necessary to force an expression evaluation context."
