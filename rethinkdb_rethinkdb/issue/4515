        "Currently `pmap` has one variant that takes `int64_t` boundaries, and one that it templated and works for arbitrary iterator types. The problem is that if you want to use the first variant but your types aren't exactly `int64_t` but some other integer types, it will use the iterator variant which isn't going to work.\n\nAlso `throttled_pmap` currently only has the `int64_t` variant, and we should add a variant that takes iterators as well.\n"
