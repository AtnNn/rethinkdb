      "Ok, this is implemented and up in review 572.  There were a few things I changed:\r\n\r\n1. Added an extra check for permission to write to the parent directory.  This was not entirely necessary, but it allows for an extra, more descriptive error message.\r\n2. Changed error reporting in the write_pid_file function to use logERR instead of fprintf(stderr), so the info will be written to the console and the log file, where possible.  This wasn't happening before, since this function is called after daemonizing, and by that point there is no longer a stderr.\r\n3. Split the checks on pid-file to be called both before daemonizing and right before writing the pid file.  This should allow us to report the error to the console, if possible."
