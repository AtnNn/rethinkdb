        "Specifically, we need to distinguish between primary replicas that were configured by the user (in table_config) and those that were elected by raft (unless they're the same).\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm using this terminology:\r\n\r\n   | primary in table_config | primary in table_status | what it's called in webui\r\n--- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------\r\n1  | true                    | true                    | Primary replica\r\n2  | true                    | false                   | Configured primary replica\r\n3  | false                   | true                    | Elected primary replica\r\n4  | false                   | false                   | Secondary replica\r\n\r\n@danielmewes has suggested \"Acting primary replica\" for row 3.\r\n@timmaxw suggested \"Future primary replica\" for 2 and \"Temporary primary replica\" for 3 in #engineering \r\n\r\nping @coffeemug @mglukhovsky, but whoever wants to comment feel free. I don't have a strong opinion about it, other than it should be something we're happy with since it'll show up several times in the webui"
