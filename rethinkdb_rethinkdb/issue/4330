        "Specifically, we need to distinguish between primary replicas that were configured by the user (in table_config) and those that were elected by raft (unless they're the same).\n\nCurrently, I'm using this terminology:\n\n|  | primary in table_config | primary in table_status | what it's called in webui |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | true | true | Primary replica |\n| 2 | true | false | Configured primary replica |\n| 3 | false | true | Elected primary replica |\n| 4 | false | false | Secondary replica |\n\n@danielmewes has suggested \"Acting primary replica\" for row 3.\n@timmaxw suggested \"Future primary replica\" for 2 and \"Temporary primary replica\" for 3 in #engineering \n\nping @coffeemug @mglukhovsky, but whoever wants to comment feel free. I don't have a strong opinion about it, other than it should be something we're happy with since it'll show up several times in the webui\n"
