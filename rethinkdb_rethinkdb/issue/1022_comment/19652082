      "The only downside is that the node version available in even the newest version of Ubuntu is 1.6, forcing basically every user to manually install a newer version of node. Fortunately it's easy enough to do this that it's not much of a burden. I agree that we should move our support to 0.10.0 minimum. When we do this though, we should document this restriction and how to easily upgrade node. I didn't know about the `n` command until recently and until then had thought this would mean being forced to compile node from source which I don't think would be acceptable."
