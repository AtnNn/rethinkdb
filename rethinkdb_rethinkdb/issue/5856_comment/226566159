      "> Last night database crashed but there is nothing in log, like nothing happened.\r\n\r\nIf the system runs out of RAM, the database server might get killed by the operating system. In that case there won't be anything in the RethinkDB log, because the rethinkdb process doesn't get a chance to write anything. You might find some messages in the syslog or in `dmesg` about the out-of-memory killer terminating rethinkdb.\r\n\r\n> I do not understand why dumping simple json to some file takes 11GB RAM.\r\n\r\nIt definitely shouldn't, we're investigating this now and will try to release a fix soon.\r\n"
