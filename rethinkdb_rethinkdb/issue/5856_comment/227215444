      "I presume from the closure that we found the solution in our email conversation, so I want to sum that up here. Both @danielmewes and I had assumed that the issue was that the `dump` script was the one taking up the memory, but it turned out that it was the `rethinkdb` process that was sucking up the memory. Likely this was because the `cache-size` option was set to larger than the available memory, making this an expected behavior.\r\n\r\nWe do print a warning into the log files at startup, but that could be easy to miss if you don't know to look for it. There might be a better way for us to try and mitigate this, but we need to balance the user's ability to set things against protecting people from theirselves, and I don't immediately see a better strategy then we have now."
