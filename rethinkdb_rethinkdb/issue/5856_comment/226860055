      "@goors: I don't see anything in the structure of your document that would obviously be the cause. But I already have developed a theory that I want to test. Would you be willing to try a slightly hacked version of our driver to see if my theory is correct? In the hope that you agree I just emailed you a driver modified to avoid this potential issue.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who wants to follow along at home, this is from branch `larkost/5856-dump-queue-trial`."
