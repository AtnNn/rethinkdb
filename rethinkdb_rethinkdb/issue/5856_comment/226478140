      "```\r\npip freeze | grep rethinkdb\r\nrethinkdb==2.3.0.post2 \r\npython --version\r\nPython 2.7.6\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith --clients 1 it uses around 10 GB of 16GB and app is ok now.\r\nLast night database crashed but there is nothing in log, like nothing happened.\r\n\r\nIf this is problem with dump what do you think of next scenario.\r\n\r\n1. Have proxy on each app server\r\n2. Have like 3 servers in cluster\r\n3. Do just backup on \"third server\" for example\r\n\r\nI do not understand why dumping simple json to some file takes 11GB RAM.\r\n\r\nTo answer you this:\r\n\r\n> Do any of your tables have particularly large documents or is there anything else \"special\" about your data?\r\n\r\nNo, there are no large documents. Maybe biggest is 32Kb.\r\n\r\nI have crontab at 1:30AM every night with just simple:\r\n\r\n`rethinkdb dump -c localhost:28015 --clients 1 --password-file /mypassfile -e dbname -f $BACKUP_DIR/$TIMESTAMP/db.tar.gz`\r\n\r\n> If you can also send me (karl @ rethinkdb.com) a sample document that might help me reproduce the case.\r\n\r\nThis is sample file: https://api.myjson.com/bins/4zmtr"
