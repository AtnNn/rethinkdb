      "Thanks for the bug report @JOE95443 .\r\nThis is probably the same issue that @nighelles mentioned in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5331 . It will be fixed with RethinkDB 2.3.0.\r\n\r\nThe issue is triggered by calling `print` directly on a cursor result by the way. You can probably avoid it by adding a `.to_array()` behind the `run()` before calling `print` on the result.\r\n\r\nIt also shouldn't affect any application that actually iterates over the cursor.\r\n\r\nClosing since it's already fixed in `next` by https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/commit/4c84e3364a833f25745eb5efd5b0494a81144fca"
