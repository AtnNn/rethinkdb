      "I have a strong suspicion that this is related to the non-atomic updates I'm doing in the workload (I reproduced the hang with a workload of only writes and non-atomic updates, so the only read in the workload is from the non-atomic udpates).  Here is exactly what the stress client is running:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n    target = random.sample(extant_keys, 1)[0]\r\n    source = random.sample(extant_keys, 1)[0]\r\n    r.table(table).get(target).update(lambda row: row.merge(r.table(table).get(source).pluck(\"value\")), non_atomic=True).run(connection)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo perhaps this query is not properly interruptible."
