        "Currently the `indexes` key on `table.config()` is a read-only field and returns the following message if you try to update it:\r\n```The change you're trying to make to `rethinkdb.table_config` has the wrong format. The `indexes` field is read-only and can't be used to create or drop indexes.```\r\n\r\nThere are two immediate (but non-pressing) arguments to change this:\r\n1. It is inconsistent with everything else except `id` and `primary_key`. And those have good reason not to be alterable. \r\n2. It would make it easier to manage configurations on tables. You could read out the `table.config()` and then write back everything but `id` and `primary_key` in one go.\r\n\r\nThe latter pre-supposes that we could come up with a way of textually serializing non-trivial indexes. I would also suggest that this field should be an object/dict rather than an array, with the key always being the name."
