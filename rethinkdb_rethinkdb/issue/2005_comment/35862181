      "Hi @dmitrig01, thank you for reporting the issue. \r\nThat looks like the backfill had a really huge impact on the count query. I will look into it.\r\n\r\nWas the backfill on the same table that you ran the count on or on a different table?\r\nDid you get a chance to look at the memory utilization while this happened? I wonder if the server might have gone into swap (in case you have swap enabled?)."
