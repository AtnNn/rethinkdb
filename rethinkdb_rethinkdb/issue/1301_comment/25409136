      "So, we currently don't hardcode a path to ql2.pb.rb. I think this is the right choice, because it means that Ruby will look in the whole $LOAD_PATH for it, and I'm not sure it will always be installed in the same directory on different systems.\r\n\r\nIf anyone in the future runs into this problem, the solution is to do:\r\n```ruby\r\n$LOAD_PATH.unshift('directory_with_ql2.pb.rb')\r\n```\r\n"
