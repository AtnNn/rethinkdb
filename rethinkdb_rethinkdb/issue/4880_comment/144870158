      "@deontologician it appears the issue is with the refactoring of [these lines](https://github.com/marshall007/rethinkdb/blob/07197781e47b01e6ab81749dfc72da9002df7ff3/drivers/javascript/cursor.coffee#L221-L227). If you change the definition of `nextCb` to the following, the `polyglot/changefeeds/edge` tests pass again:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnextCb = (err, data) =>\r\n    if err?\r\n        if err.message is 'No more rows in the cursor.'\r\n            onFinished?()\r\n        else \r\n            cb(err)\r\n    else if cb(null, data) isnt false\r\n        @_next nextCb\r\n    else\r\n        onFinished?()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, my refactored version was continuing iteration even after encountering an error. I can throw the fix in a new PR if you'd like. Just let me know!"
