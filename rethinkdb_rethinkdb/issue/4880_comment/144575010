      "Sorry about that! I tested under `node@v0.12.x` which exports the native `Promise` object as a global, so that explains the `connections` tests. I have no idea why the `polyglot/changefeeds/edge` tests are failing though, that seems unrelated to the `Promise` issue. Will try to dig into it further."
