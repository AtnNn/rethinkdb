      "Hi, sorry to \"bump\" this thread, I just ran into the issue again, and it's easily reproducible in our setup. RethinkDB 2.3.5, 5 nodes, 5 proxies. Two app servers are watching the jobs table to see if a specific query is running, even after filter()ing everything out, the traffic went up.\r\n\r\nWe found a way to measure just the container traffic, so this doesn't count proxies/apps. Outbound traffic on every RethinkDB node went up by 1-2MB/s, inbound traffic went up by 4-5MB/s for the nodes where the changefeed is running. Actual number of all jobs visible in the jobs table is 40~50. Without the changefeed, the average is 500~600kB/s on each node (both sent and received)."
