      "@analytik Thanks for the update and additional data. \r\n\r\nThe queries in the `jobs` table have a string representation of the query itself as one of their fields. Could you check how big those values are on average (approximately)? You wrote above that many of the queries are inserts and updates of about 1 KB. But I wonder if the spaces used in the string-representation for indentation could blow these (or other queries) up sufficiently to explain the 4-5 MB/s of incoming traffic."
