      "Answer: Yes, they can. As long as a ghost server is connected, backfilling doesn't finish. Once I terminate it the tables become available.\r\n\r\nExact steps to reproduce:\r\n* Start a two-server cluster, let's say the servers are called A and B\r\n* Create a table, reconfigure to `{shards: 2, replicas: 1}`\r\n* Remove one of the servers from the cluster, for example server B:\r\n`r.db('rethinkdb').table('server_config').filter({name: \"B\"}).delete()`\r\n* Reconfigure the table to `{shards: 2, replicas: 1}`\r\n* The table never becomes available, the replicas are stuck in state \"backfilling_data\".\r\n* Shut down the ghost server (server B)\r\n* The table becomes available\r\n"
