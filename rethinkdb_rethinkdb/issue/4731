        "I've got an issue on one node of my 5 server cluster test-installation.\n\n4 of 5 Servers run Arch Linux, one is running Debian Jessie. Fulla is running Arch Linux as well. The only difference is that Fulla is longer installed than the others and I'm connecting to fully via ssh-forwarding for the administrations-panel.\n\nSince ArchLinux is using systemd, RethinkDB should send it's logs to journalctl ... and this seems to work.
