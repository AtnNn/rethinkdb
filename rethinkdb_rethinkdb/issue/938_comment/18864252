      "Version of node doesn't matter, I looked into changelog between cs 1.6.2 and 1.6.3 and one, fairly young, commit really tells something like \"disallow 'for own'\". So if you compiled fine, it is probably there already is no \"for own\" in 1.5.\n\nMichel wrote:\n> So I just built with CoffeeScript 1.6.3 without any problem on my Arch \n> laptop (node v0.10.7, npm 1.2.21).\n>\n> @herby <https://github.com/herby> what version of node are you running?\n>\n> \8212\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub \n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/938#issuecomment-18861978>.\n>"
