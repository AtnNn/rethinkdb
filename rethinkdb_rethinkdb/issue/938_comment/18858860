      "@wmrowan, @neumino, @atnnn, could you take a look at this?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems like we're often at the mercy of CS compiler changes (which seem to break fairly often). I don't see an issue for this on the coffeescript repo, but in the meantime, you can always try the source distribution that has most of these assets precompiled: http://download.rethinkdb.com/dist/\r\n\r\nAlso, quick question: I don't see another issue reported for build problems on CentOS with 1.5. What problem are you encountering when trying to build 1.5 (besides the coffeescript issue)?"
