      "Thanks @mlucy. A few suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. we could make r.between polymorphic instead of adding r.during\r\n2. maybe add duration.between(duration, duration) -> bool (or fail if comparing uncomparables, such as days and months)\r\n3. hours should be (0-23) [1]\r\n4. maybe add duration.total_seconds() -> double or null\r\n5. (time/duration).coerce_to\r\n6. I also realised that the zero-padded notation for durations does not support weeks.\r\n\r\n[1] iso8601 also allows 24, but only for 24:00 (to represent midnight on the same day). I think it's ugly. Trivia: if we did allow 24:00, would we have 23:60 > 24:00?"
