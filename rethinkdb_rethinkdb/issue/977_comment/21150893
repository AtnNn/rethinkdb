      "Hm.  Well, here's how I'm thinking about it:\r\n\r\n* Pro-positional\r\n  - The \"I want to specify year, month, day, and hour, but not minutes or seconds, and I don't want to have to type `0` twice.\" use-case doesn't seem too compelling to me.\r\n  - It would be more typing to use optargs in 99% of cases -- the two zeroes for minutes and seconds would be outweighed by the `:hours =>`.\r\n\r\n* Pro-optional\r\n  - Keeping track of 7 positional arguments sorta sucks, so optargs might be more readable.\r\n  - Only need to implement one function on the server.\r\n\r\nWhat do other people think?\r\n\r\n(I think dates are just going to be an exception to our time-boxing rules no matter what we do, so I've given up on trying not to debate the spec even though it's \"settled\".)"
