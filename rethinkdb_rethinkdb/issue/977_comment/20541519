      "From my perspective, the sensible default is to assume that if a timestamp includes a timezone, the timestamp should be processed in that timezone. An alternate timezone could be passed in by providing an optional parameter, with the parameter defaulting to null.\r\n\r\nThis default makes additional sense when you consider that if someone is consistently normalizing timezones to their querying machine's timezone, they may well be normalizing them at write time instead of read time (i.e., if they frequently want all timestamps to be treated as UTC, they may well be converting them to UTC when they store them, and thus won't need coercion an query time)."
