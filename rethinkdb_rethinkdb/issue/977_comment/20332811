      "Actually another open question (6) that's important is which types to implement. E.g.: `Date`, `Time`, `DateTime`, `Duration`, etc. (I think we need to support all of these, though `Date` and `Time` are merely cases of `DateTime` with some control bits flipped).\r\n\r\nAlso FYI -- if you look at MySQL docs (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/datetime.html) they offer a variety of types that handle relevant tradeoffs above differently (e.g. different representations on the server), and I think it's an overkill and is a poor design -- I bet having to choose between `DATETIME` and `TIMESTAMP` doesn't make users happy, and having a `DATE` type, `DATETIME` type, but no `TIME` type confuses the heck out of people.\r\n\r\n"
