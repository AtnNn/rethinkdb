      "We had a conversation about this last night, and @atnnn convinced me that not storing time zones on the server is a bad idea.\r\n\r\nAs for leap seconds, I think we're split on this internally. I believe @mlucy thinks it's ok not to support them at all, and @atnnn thinks we need to support them (please correct me if I'm misrepresenting your opinions). I'm split on this point, and I don't know what @jdoliner and @srh think (including @srh since he has strong opinions on time implementation)."
