      "If we start getting fancy with time zones, there might be more incompatibilities with client libraries' notions of how time zones should work.  We'll need to be aware of that and ready for that.  Of course, despite whatever effort we put into time zone support, the vast majority of users' applications would most appropriately use GMT or UTC timestamps for everything, since most people aren't making calendaring applications."
