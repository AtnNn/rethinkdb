      "I just want to chime in to say that if you chose to not store leap seconds internally but don't want to break on valid ISO dates, I believe the right way to handle is by subtracting 60 seconds and adding one minute as opposed to just subtracting 1 second, otherwise the math doesn't add up (23:59:60 should be > 23:59:59, the only way to keep that property true is storing as 00:00:00 next day)."
