      "I don't think `r.day('monday')` is all that weird.  (Also, doing it that way means that driver developers only have to implement 2 terms instead of 17 as well.  We already have ~100 terms that driver developers have to implement to have a minimal complete driver; I think the sheer number of terms we ask people to do is getting a bit high.)"
