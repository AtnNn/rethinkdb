      "*Date support would be a great addition, really looking forward to it!*\r\n\r\nHowever, the proposed syntax makes me think of MongoDB and their inconsistent api which I'm not a big fan of.\r\n\r\nTrailing underscores and abbreviations are hard to remember:\r\n\r\n    duration.dur_{lt/gt/le/ge/eq/ne}(other_duration) => bool\r\n    duration.dur_sub(other_duration) => third_duration\r\n    duration.dur_add(other_duration) => third_duration\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could go with `duration.add` (or `duration.add_duration`) and `duration.compare` instead?\r\n    \r\nMixing of camelCase and snake_case is very confusing:\r\n\r\n    time.year_day() => number\r\n    duration.totalSeconds() => number\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you picked one and used it consistently."
