      "Hi @sandstrom the sentiments you have here are definitely shared by the development team and I think everything you have an issue with is not making it into the final product. It's tough to tell because this is such a monstrous thread but we decided pretty early on in the conversation not to have `dur_lt`, `dur_add` etc. Durations are actually just numbers now so we you just use normal `+` and `-` with them. Furthermore dates have overloads for `-` and other functions that make sense.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know every driver we support adheres strictly to either camel case or snake case. Whichever is more standard in the language itself (JS is camel case, python and ruby are snake case). However because we on the dev team all maintain and use different drivers we all wind up with our own preferences for how to talk about things which can be confusing in issues."
