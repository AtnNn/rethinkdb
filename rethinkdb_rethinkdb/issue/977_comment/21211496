      "I agree with @srh -- I think we should keep it to original spec. Here is my rationale:\r\n\r\n* Everyone else I know of handles this by using positional arguments, not optionals\r\n* I don't think keeping track of positional arguments is too hard\r\n* I think that using optional arguments to specify time every time would be *really* annoying. I'd rather look up the constructor I want and use that, then have to specify positionals for every time construction."
