      "Another change I'd like to make: instead of having three versions of `r.now`, we just have one that produce a time with no timezone attached, and people can write `r.now.in_timezone(...)` instead of `r.now(:timezone => ...)` to put it into a timezone.  I don't think we should add an optarg to reproduce the behavior of a chainable term that we're adding anyway."
