      "So, after some thought, I think that we should just use whatever behavior our ISO 8601 parsing library defaults to as our rule for parsing leap seconds.  If we have to choose, I think that we should ignore leap seconds and have `5:60` compare equal to `6:00`.  (If the library we end up using is smart enough to keep track of leap seconds and parse those into different epoch times, though, I don't see any reason to explicitly stop it from doing that.)\r\n\r\n"
