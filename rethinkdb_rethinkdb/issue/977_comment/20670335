      "@mlucy Rather than limiting RethinkDB to millisecond accuracy, perhaps it could return the full accuracy of the time in nanoseconds (or whatever), and drivers for clients that can't handle times that precise can truncate to milliseconds? \r\n\r\nAdvantage is more capable languages aren't held back by the less capable ones, and sometimes >millisecond accuracy is useful. Disadvantage is anything where people are relying on time for ordering will suddenly change when a client library gains support for nanoseconds. "
