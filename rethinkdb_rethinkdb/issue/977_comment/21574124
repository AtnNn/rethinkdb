      "I overlooked that part of the proposal actually.\r\n\r\n`time.year => number`\r\n`time.month => number` (1-12)\r\n`time.day => number` **(1-366)**\r\n`time.weekday => number` (1-7, starting on Monday per. ISO 8601)\r\n`time.hour => number` (0-23)\r\n`time.minute => number` (0-59)\r\n`time.second => number` (0-59.999, double)\r\n\r\nThat part seems like an accident.  `time.day` should return the day of the month, a number from 1 to 31.  I would have thought that's what you meant all along.  And that's what you're now saying.\r\n\r\nUsing `day` is appropriate because it's the year/month/day/hours/minutes/seconds analogue to the constructor.\r\n\r\n`day_of_year` and `day_of_week` are appropriate.  `weekday` sounded fine before, but really a weekday is any day that isn't on the weekend.\r\n\r\nEdit: However, beware that my preferences between `weekday` and `day_of_week` are basically artistic.  `day_of_year` is a standard term though.  Having them all be commonly prefixed with \"day\" makes the API more findable, though."
