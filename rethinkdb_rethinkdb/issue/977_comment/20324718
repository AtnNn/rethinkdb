      "I think that having people access non-existent attributes of objects as a metaphor for function calls might be a little confusing.  Also, it would be confusing for `o[:year]` to work but not `o.pluck(:year)`.\r\n\r\nAlso, do we really allow arrays as primary keys?\r\n\r\nIf we switch to supporting objects as primary keys, we'd have to go back and make the optional argument to `get_all` mandatory in order to remove any ambiguity."
