      "Since not all languages have a built in date type the appropriate format for representing dates will be language dependent. Since the driver is the interface to the host language, it should be up to the driver to decided upon the best representation.\r\n\r\nA separate datum type in the protobuf spec is easier for the driver to convert to the preferred type than an weird looking object format that must be searched for in every Datum object field.\r\n\r\nA separate datum type also cannot be leaked accidentally as a normal object. If the driver developer really does want to expose {`__reql_type__: ...` to the user then he or she can always do so explicitly by constructing such an object from date results."
