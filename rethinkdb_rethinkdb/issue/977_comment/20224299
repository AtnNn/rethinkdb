      "@coffeemug Right, I get what you mean now. I just didn't get where the above methods fit in your example though. I expected date manipulation would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table('events').filter(\r\n  r.row('takes_place_in').weekday().eq(1) # Monday\r\n).run(conn, callback)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo?\r\n\r\nSorry if my questions are stupid, I'm still figuring out RethinkDB, I'm not sure what's possible or not."
