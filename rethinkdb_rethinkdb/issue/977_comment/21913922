      "So, another addition to the proposal: I think that we should have an option (perhaps on `run`?) that prevents the drivers from translating `$reql_type$` objects into native types.  This will be useful in several situations:\r\n* In languages that can't easily represent a time + timezone, like Ruby 1.8, driver developers might just produce a UTC timezone, discarding the timezone information on the server; in this case the user needs some easy way to access the information.\r\n* It will make writing tools like Marc's import/export tool much easier.  (Another way to do this would be to overload the JSON serialization function on the time types we produce.)\r\n* It lets people turn off the magic when debugging something confusing."
