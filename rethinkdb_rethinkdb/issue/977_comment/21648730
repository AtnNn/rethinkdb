      "@coffeemug -- No problem, you are recused.\r\n\r\nI agree with @srh .  I'll implement that interface.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would like to formally retract my request to change the `r.monday` etc. interface.  Switching to an enum would be slightly easier for us on the server, but would have some problems:\r\n* The backtraces would have numbers instead of names.\r\n* Drivers like the Ruby driver that automatically handle new terms would have to have special logic for enums.\r\n* We now have things in the `r.` namespace that evaluate to integers rather than RQL types, which might cause subtle problems -- e.g. in the Ruby driver, where there are still some binary operators that we can only overload on their lefthand side in 1.8, it would cause confusing overload resolution.\r\n\r\nI'll just do this the mildly-irritating way and add all the protobuf terms."
