      "Some more thoughts on timezones. Here's a key question. When someone says \"give me every event that happened on a Monday\" what exactly do they mean wrt timezones? There are three options I can think of:\r\n\r\n* They mean \"Monday\" from the POV of the event creator (i.e. the timezone specified by the client that inserted the event record)\r\n* They mean \"Monday\" from their own POV (i.e. their client's timezone at the time of the query)\r\n* They mean \"Monday\" from the point of view of the server (i.e. the processing server node's timezone). This option probably isn't very useful, but I'm including it for completion.\r\n\r\nSo the question is, do we allow both of the first two options or only one, and if we allow both which is default behavior and how does the user specify the other behavior?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n@mlucy -- since we're getting to the end of the discussion timebox, could you write up a complete proposal for dates taking into account everything discussed so far? (with great power to break ties comes great responsibility to write up proposals when it's the last thing you want to do :-D) I'll ask @srh to review the complete proposal (which will probably result in some additional discussion) and then we'll move on to the implementation stage."
