      "Could we do:\r\n\r\n- `day_of_week`\r\n- `day_of_month`\r\n- `day_of_year`\r\n\r\nHaving `day` default to `day_of_month` isn't immediately obvious to me (I would have guessed it's `day_of_week`) and this way it's consistent and you'll never have to look it up. If I came across some code that just said `day` I'd probably have to dip into documentation to figure out which one it is so I'd rather just sacrifice the verbosity and have it right there for me.\r\n\r\nAlso I think: `week_day` and `day_week` (and associates would be acceptable and the shortening might be worth it. I don't feel to strongly about that one."
