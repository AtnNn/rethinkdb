      "So, in this one particular case the `__rql_type__` solution works fairly well, because our naive ordering on objects exactly matches the ordering we want (since `_` is less than all letters and `ms_since_epoch_utc` will sort correctly).\r\n\r\nSo I wouldn't be incredibly opposed to doing it that way.  The only large cost I can think of is that people could no longer use times as primary keys.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, @atnnn ?"
