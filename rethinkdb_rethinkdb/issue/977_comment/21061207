      "I feel like if we're going to add `during` it would be better to just make it a generic thing that can be used for any value. `time.during(time1, time2)` is equivalent to `time1 < time && time < time2`. And it's a useful function for things other than times. If we don't want to add it now that's fine but I think if we don't we should just scrap `during` because it's a less generic version of a function we will want to add later and it'll just be a pain for people when we remove it. I think I'd prefer having an overload \r\n\r\nIronically enough this function could be made superfluous in Ruby and maybe Javascript because we could support a syntax like: `time1 < time < time2` in Ruby or `time1.lt(time).lt(time2)` in javascript. However it won't work in Python because Python supports something like this natively."
