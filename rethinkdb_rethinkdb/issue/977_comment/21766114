      "Isn't Ruby 1.8.7 retired?  Do we care about it?  Ruby 1.9's Time supports representing a time with any time zone offset.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to drop time zone offset support and only allow UTC times.  (The common wisdom for storing times in databases is to always specify the UTC timezone, according to some angry people I know.  Nobody is going to be able to use our existing time-with-offset scheme for any advanced date logic anyway, in the sense that saying \"Mondays from 9-5 in my timezone\" is not supported by ReQL.)"
