      "I'd like to recuse myself from this question (unless you *need* me to chime in, in which case I will). Your suggestions and suggestions by others above (@jdoliner and @srh) seem sensible, so I don't know if there is anything else I can add. Also, whichever thing we pick sounds fine to me, so I don't have a particularly strong opinion on this.\r\n\r\n(Sorry -- for some reason designing a date interface isn't my cup of tea; I don't think I'd be particularly good at it, either)"
