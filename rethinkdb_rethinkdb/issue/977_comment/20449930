      "@atnnn the rationale behind this is that it's consistent with UNIX time, where a leap second is computed as the next second counted twice. That is, 23:59:60 and 00:00:00 are indistinguishable in UNIX time, so 23:59:60 actually isn't < 00:00:00 in your internal representation if you choose to not store leap seconds. I hope that's not too confusing. You can validate by looking at software that has to deal with UTC <-> UNIX conversions."
