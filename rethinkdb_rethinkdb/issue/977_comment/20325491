      "Yeah accessing attributes for methods is not quite there. I really wish there was some way to make it work though.\r\n\r\nArrays right now can't be pkeys but the only reason for that is space concerns and we can fix that fairly easily. Using times as keys in a secondary index is going to be really important to people though. I think making the optional argument to `get_all` not optional is not a good enough reason not to allow objects as keys. It will be really nice if a person can just register a type and use it was a primary key."
