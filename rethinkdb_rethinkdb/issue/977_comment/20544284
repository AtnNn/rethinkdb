      "It would probably also be good to include a timezone conversion function. Then you have both situations covered equally- you can default to using the timestamp's timezone, while occasionally coercing all timestamps to the same timezone, or you can default to coercing everything to your chosen timezone at write time, while occasionally converting a sequence of timezones based on some property of each row, in a map function."
