      ">\n> What string does timezone() return? \"-06:00\", \"+01:00\", and the like?\n> Those are not time zones. They are time offsets. If we're going to use time\n> offsets we shouldn't use the word \"time zone\" (or \"zone\") anywhere in the\n> interface.\n>\n> My suggestion is to use complete timezones (e.g., \"EST\", or perhaps\n\"US/Eastern\"), as time offsets do not account for daylight savings, and\nthus do not allow you to accurately determine the local day or hour a\ntimestamp represents."
