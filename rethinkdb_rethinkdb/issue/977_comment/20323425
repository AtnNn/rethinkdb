      "@coffeemug's proposal is actually almost exactly what I was in the process of writing. The one thing I wonder about is if we could even get away without have `getYear` functions and instead having a syntax like `r.expr(datetime.now)[\"year\"]` which would basically amount to a way to define methods on custom types. This would save us having to add 10 different protocol buffer terms to the language which I'm really not crazy about and would also be a syntax that we could eventually expose to people using `register_type` I actually think it could be a really powerful feature.\r\n\r\nAlso the issue about ordering is pretty moot IMO we should extend our ordering rules so they order custom types by their typenames rather than just considering them all to be objects. We can also allow for custom orderings of the different members of the type (although in this case the ordering we want happens to be the same as the one for objects.\r\n\r\nNot being able to have dates as keys is a pretty big deal breaker IMO opinion. We should just allow objects as keys there's really no good reason not to do that when we allow arrays as keys."
