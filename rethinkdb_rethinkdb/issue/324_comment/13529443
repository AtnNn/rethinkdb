      "I think that depends on whether we adopt the rule that ops dealing with multiple streams should work via a prefix notation. If we do, `zip` would make more sense, if we don't, `map` would make more sense. Personally I think we *should* adopt that philosophy (it seems cleaner to me), which would imply keeping `zip` and `map` separate."
