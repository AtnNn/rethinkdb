        "We currently return pseudo types with all the geo spatial operations.\n\nCould we return the geojson representation (basically the same object without the $reql_type$). That would be the same behavior as what we do with dates.\n\nThe drawback is that people may save geojson objects and do geo operations on them, which currently fails.\nSo could we automatically try to coerce objects to geometry objects if a geo operation is done on them.\n\nIf we don't, it means that people have to wrap all geometry data with `r.geojson` when building a REST API.\nIt also means that if someone save a geojson object instead of a pseudo type by mistakes, the geo index is going to ignore it -- which is really bad.\n"
