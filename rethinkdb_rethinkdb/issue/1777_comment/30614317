      "Thats very true. To be completely honest my focus was on releasing a working driver for RethinkDB > v1.9 and I have not yet had time to work on optimization. That being said GoRethink seems to have much better performance than the older RethinkGo driver.\r\n\r\nI am hoping to improve the performance around the RethinkDB 2.0 release but I might be able to get it done even sooner if I have the time."
