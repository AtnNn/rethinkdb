      "I'm not sure.  I would definitely take a second-look at encoding, and see how much time you spend in the protobuf-encoding library vs. the rest of the driver.  If Go's protobuf encoder is actually faster than its JSON encoder, then it deserves major kudos -- the protobuf libraries available in Python, Rub, and JS fall an order of magnitude short of the JSON libraries."
