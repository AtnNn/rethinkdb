      "Ok so I have looked over the code again and spent some time checking where the driver spends most of its time and it still appears to be after the query is built/ when the query is being sent to the database.\r\n\r\nAlso when I ran @neumino's non batched test JS script I got an execution time of over 80 seconds although this is on a slowish laptop. When I ran my Go test script I got a lower time (50 seconds) so it makes me think that the performance issues are not on the driver side but the database side.\r\n\r\nRegarding MongoDB I am not sure why the performance is so much better for inserts there if they now acknowledge writes. Perhaps both me and @pengux were using an older driver or database version."
