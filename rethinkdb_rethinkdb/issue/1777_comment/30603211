And some information about your machine?\r\nYou may also be interested in reading this too: http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#my-insert-queries-are-slow.-how-can-i-speed-t\r\n\r\nUsing this quick/dirty script: http://justonepixel.com/rethinkdb/test.js I need about 1.1 second to insert everything (batched inserts, ssd, 12gb ram, i7 3rd gen).\r\n\r\nIt's getting quite late here, I can try to run point-writes later tomorrow."
