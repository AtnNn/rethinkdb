      "@dancannon: We often had issues with Nagle's algorithm delaying TCP writes.\r\nIt should mostly be a problem with acknowledged queries (i.e. without noreply), but might be worth a try to turn it off (if it isn't off by default in Go anyway, which some comments here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6164892 suggest). Nagle's algorithm can delay sending the query if the message size and the protocol buffer itself are sent in two separate TCP writes."
