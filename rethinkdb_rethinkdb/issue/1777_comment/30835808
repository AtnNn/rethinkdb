      "The Go driver uses protobufs to encode the object however I have just implemented JSON encoding and it turned out to be slower in my initial tests. After further tests I realized that the reason for the much longer insert time for RethinkDB was due to MongoDB inserting immediately and not acknowledge writes similar to using RethinkDB with the NoReply flag. When using this  flag I started getting results of around 4-5 seconds.\r\n\r\nThat being said when the NoReply flag is set the driver seems to be slower than some of the other drivers. Can you think of any other reason why this might be? "
