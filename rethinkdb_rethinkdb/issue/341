        "Underscore.js has a really good set of array operations that are commonly used and would be very helpful in reql: http://underscorejs.org/#arrays I don't want to go through this list quite yet, but once we get to this issue after 1.4, I'd like to look at them one by one and see which ones we should adopt.\n\n(Also, from @al3xandru's list, the only array operation we're currently missing is `insert` which would insert an element into the middle of an array).\n\nAlso STL is a very good source of these ops IMO (e.g. `push_back` and `push_front`, etc.)\n"
