      "I remember the \"more data available\" data explorer bug. It's not specific to geo queries -- any first query that has multiple batches will do.\r\n\r\nSince @AtnNn refactored some of the data explorer code for changefeed support, perhaps this bug is gone in his branch? If not, it's something we might want to fix as part of that refactoring.\r\n\r\n"
