      "#3037 is definitely fixed in 1.15.1, it may have regressed in 1.15.2.\r\n\r\nWe have some older servers running 1.14.1, so I see #3037 almost daily on them, but never on my local machine running 1.15.1. Also just tried @danielmewes repro steps above without success on 1.15.1. Could also be platform specific I guess, but doubtful (I'm on OS X Yosemite.)"
