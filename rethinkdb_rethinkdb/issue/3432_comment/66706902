      "@brwnll That's very weird indeed. Could be a bug.\r\nWhich version of RethinkDB are you running, and on which operating system?\r\nDoes this still happen after restarting the RethinkDB server?\r\n\r\nCan you send us your rethinkdb_data directory that contains the data files? We would be happy to sign a CLA if it contains sensitive data, and can arrange for an upload server to securely copy the file.\r\n\r\nOne thing I find especially odd is that the Data Explorer shows the \"More data is available\" message. If I remember correctly `getNearest` doesn't even return a cursor, but an array. Almost makes me think something might get mixed up on the client side.\r\n\r\n@brwnll If you have time, could you try two things for me?\r\n* Run the query from outside the Data Explorer, e.g. with a Python, Ruby or other client\r\n* Run this query and see if it works: r.table('locations').getIntersecting(r.circle([-122.730209, 48.990702], 100), { index: 'address.location' })"
