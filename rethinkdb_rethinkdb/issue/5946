        "The `rethinkdb` table is a virtual table that often doesn't share the same behaviour as the other real tables. It would be helpful if `dbList` had an option to either include or exclude the `rethinkdb` table. I would prefer that it was excluded by default, but this is a breaking change, whereas included by default isn't.\n\nThe use case that prompted this was wanting to reconfigure all the databases in a cluster, and having errors thrown when I iterated over `rethinkdb` when using `dbList`.\n"
