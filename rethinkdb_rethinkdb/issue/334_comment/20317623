      "Actually, another major problem with the `.map(...).concat` solution: it wouldn't be identical to what we currently have.  We currently let people return sequences from the function they pass to concatmap, so they could write e.g:\r\n```ruby\r\nr([1,2,3]).concatmap {|x|\r\n  r.table('test').get_all(x)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince you can't store streams in arrays, we would lose that (useful) behavior by moving to a two-term solution."
