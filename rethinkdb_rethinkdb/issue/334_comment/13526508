      "To clarify what I meant, I agree that we need `concatMap`, I also think that we should keep it because it's awesome and not because we just need it, and I think we should make it available to users because it's actually very useful in dealing with arrays. I just think we should rename the function itself to something more palatable. Mongo people call (a much less powerful but roughly equivalent function) `unwind` which is an ok name, though I'm not too thrilled about it."
