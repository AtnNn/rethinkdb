      "Nobody (that I remember) complained about `concatMap`, but I don't think people use the function often yet. This name seems confusing to me personally. In general, if we can come up with a good, descriptive single word name for this function, I'd like to do that. If we end up using a concatenation of two words (e.g. `flatMap`), I think we might as well use `concatMap`.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I don't think changing the name is a matter of adoption. Here is how I think about this. If we do our job well (and we have to assume we will, because otherwise the whole discussion becomes moot), in a year or two *everyone* will be using RethinkDB, and they'll be stuck with it for ten or fifteen years or more. Do we really want `concatMap` to be a part of that API? It seems like the worst named function in ReQL to me right now, and I'd like to think of something better if possible."
