      "@mlucy that's a good point. I think especially with changefeeds we don't want to guarantee any particular ordering for `union`.\r\n\r\nI personally am tempted to close this and stick with `concatMap`, since none of the discussed alternatives seem to be without caveats.\r\nDoes anyone still believe strongly that we should rename `concatMap`?"
