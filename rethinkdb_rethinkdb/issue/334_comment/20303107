      "Mongo and Couch's `emit` is a different command, but it has a similar meaning (i.e. emit multiple docs for a single doc). I don't think it would be a stretch to use it (in that people would understand what it means), and we don't have to have exactly the same commands as others.\r\n\r\nAs far as the `.map(...).concat()` proposal. I agree the name collision issue is problematic, but I think that's solvable. I still feel the overall direction of this is significantly better than `concatMap`. Performance is definitely an issue, but we could implement `concat` (or whatever name we'd choose) that's tacked onto a `map` as `concatMap` internally. It's a bit of optimization work, but I don't think it would be too hard.\r\n\r\nOverall, I strongly disagree that `map_and_flatten` (or any such name) is a better choice than `.map(...).flatten()`, or even `emit`. Both of these seem strictly better to me.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I moved this out of 1.8-required, so we can hold off on this if people like."
