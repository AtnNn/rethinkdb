      "I'd leave `concatMap` as it is, since the name is pretty standard, and add a recursive `flatten` term. I think if the major use case for this term moves to another term, (i.e. everyone takes all their array flattening business over to the `flatten` store), then `concatMap` is free to have a scary name since it'll only be used in odd circumstances.\r\n\r\nI don't see a lot of benefit to trying to make the name less general so it's easier to explain. It does exactly what's on the tin, it maps and concatenates."
