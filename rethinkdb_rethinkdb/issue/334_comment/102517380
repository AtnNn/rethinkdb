      "FWIW: I spent an hour today looking for the functionality that concatMap provides. However, coming from the MongoDB world, I was more familiar with the term 'unwind'. I wouldn't advocate changing the name at this point, but including the term \"unwind\" or \"flatten\" in the docs would help recovering MongoDB devs identify/google the term. \r\n\r\nIn my case, I'm looking to map reduce on arrays of objects, which is often how unwind is used with Mongo. Might be helpful to include that use case some where in the docs, if it isn't already there. "
