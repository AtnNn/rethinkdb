      "Did we have users complaining about `concatMap` being scary?\r\n\r\nI think it's fine. With our current API, I would more expect a syntax like that\r\n```\r\nsequence.map().concat()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't like `unwind` -- in the sense that I have no idea what it can do (with just the name)\r\n`flatMap` is fine, but I somehow prefer `concatMap`. To \"flatten\" is less common than \"concat\" (at least that's how I feel as a non native English speaker)"
