      "I have another idea. What about renaming `concatMap` to `emit` (as in, for every element in a sequence, you're emitting a bunch of other elements)? So:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n// Proposal one\r\nseq.map(lambda x: [1, 2]).concat()\r\n\r\n// Proposal two\r\nseq.emit(lambda x: [1, 2])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure which one I like more yet. `emit` is a well understood name and is used by other systems to name the same functionality. Both proposals are nice IMO and are easy to understand. @neumino @mglukhovsky -- which one do you like more?"
