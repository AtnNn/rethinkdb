      "Sorry to expand this now, I just had an idea and I wanted to put it down here so I don't forget. We can discuss it later when this issue gets scheduled.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to drop `concatMap` and add an optional `multi` argument to `map`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('users').map(r.row('posts'), { multi: 'true' })\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be congruent with the proposal here: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1096#issuecomment-20253058"
