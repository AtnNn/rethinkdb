      "`emit` in Mongo and Couch both modify a table. And in node `emit` emits events. There's no way this function isn't going to be confusing to people. I'm actually not finding any language where `emit` has the meaning you're talking about could you link to one?\r\n\r\nI really think the best proposal is `.map(...).flatten()` `flatten` is already familiar to users of our 3 main languages and has exactly the meaning we want. Why not just use it?\r\n\r\n> Overall, I strongly disagree that map_and_flatten (or any such name) is a better choice than .map(...).flatten(), or even emit.\r\n\r\nWith whom are you disagreeing? No one in this thread has claimed this is a better choice or presented it as something that should be done instead of `.map(...).flatten()`."
