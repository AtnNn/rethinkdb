      "> could you link to one?\r\n\r\nHere is `emit` in mongo: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/command/mapReduce/#requirements-for-the-map-function. It doesn't modify a table as best as I can tell, it just emits a number of elements for map/reduce. It's imperative, so it's slightly different, but it feels pretty close in spirit to what we want.\r\n\r\n> I really think the best proposal is `.map(...).flatten()`\r\n\r\nAgreed. (I'd add an optional `shallow` argument to flatten, though, similar to underscore).\r\n\r\n> With whom are you disagreeing?\r\n\r\nErr, nm. I thought you argued for `map_and_flatten` as an exclusive solution. If we choose to implement two, I'd prefer to call it `mapFlatten`, though and just say it's more efficient (though a better option, I think, would be to just optimize it on the server if it's easy and not add another command)."
