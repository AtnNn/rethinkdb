      "We shouldn't use the name `concat` for this since the definition we're attaching to it is only its definition in MLish based languages (including Haskell). Ruby and Javascript both use `flatten` as the name for this function and have a function called `concat` with a different meaning.\r\n\r\nI also really think we should keep the current function and call it `map_and_flatten` the name might be a bit verbose but there's no way anyone is going to be confused about it and with the other syntax it's kind of unlikely people will run in to it but it has a number of pros:\r\n- We still want to have it internally because the other syntax is harder to optimize\r\n- For users who really really care about squeezing out some more performance they'll have it available.\r\n- It saves breaking backward compatibility with the drivers which is always a bit of a pain"
