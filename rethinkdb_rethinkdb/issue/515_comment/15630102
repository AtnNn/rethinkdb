      "Let's get a second issue open for adding driver support for other languages. There are a ton of things that still need to be done for secondary indexes to be complete and it doesn't make sense to tack this particular one on to this issue. When I'm looking through the issue list and I see \"Merge Secondary Indexes in to Next\" I'm going to get a very wrong impression of what's left to be done for this issue. And it seems like it's just increasing the signal to noise of our issue tracker."
