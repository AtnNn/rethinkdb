        "@neumino says:\n\nWhat's the plan for the data explorer? I think we didn't really decide on what to do.\nI would prefer just not to display feeds for a few reasons\n- it seems fragile to me (http connections are not like tcp connections, they time out every 5 minutes)\n- it would require a non trivial amount of changes to display the feeds (we wait for 40 results, then update the DOM - we don't update the DOM after each result).\n\nThat being said, nothing is impossible, but displaying feeds in a good way would require at least a few days of work.\n\nOne more thing: if we don't want to display them, we need to send back a different type than `SUCCESS_PARTIAL` (or there is no way I can make the different between a cursor coming from `r.table(...)` and a cursor coming from `r.table(...).changes()`).\n I thought we agreed on sending back `FEED`?\n"
