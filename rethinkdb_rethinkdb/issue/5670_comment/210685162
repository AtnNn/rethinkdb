      "No i dont see any logs beacause when i try to require rethinkdb in rails console , it fails. When i request using webUI yes then i can see logs  But now i have upgraded my ruby version to 2.3.0 . \r\n`gem list rethinkdb` gives me `rethinkdb (2.3.0.0)` . And more over when i run this command\r\n `rethinkdb --version` i get `rethinkdb 1.4.1 (CLANG 4.1 ((tags/Apple/clang-421.11.66)))` . I am a bit confused about my version because i installed rethinkdb using homebrew and it gives me version `rethinkdb-2.1.5-2` . What am i doing wrong ? Is there any way to wipe out all the versions of rethinkdb on my machine and then test it again . Because i have the same connection issue when i try to test using python driver . Your help will be appreciated."
