      "@larkost it works , i download .pkg version and uninstall the previous version. Then i ran the package to install the updated version. And now i query in rails console I dont see any connection out problem. I think that drivers available in older versions of rethinkdb are not feasible with current version. Moreover, @mglukhovsky @larkost If I am not wrong, currently there is no way to switch database in WebUI of rethinkDB, right ?"
