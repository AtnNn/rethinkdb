      "You can download the `.dmg` from our [website](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/osx/), and that has an uninstaller (note: there is a bug in it on older MacOS versions right now). That will clean out that old version, assuming you used a `.pkg` version. Personally I prefer the version from `.pkg` over homebrew, but that is mostly personal preference.\r\n\r\nBut it is likely that that old version of RethinkDB is what you have been running, and that is the cause."
