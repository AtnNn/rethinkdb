      "We are a little confused by this, since there should be good error messages even if you had mixed versions of server and client. One thought is that you might have your port numbers mixed up, and are trying to connect to, for instance, the cluster port? Is there anything in the server logs when you make this connection?\r\n\r\nWe just explicitly ran an experiment where we ran a 2.3.0 server and connected to it with a 2.2.6 version of the Ruby driver, and things worked correctly (as expected). Could you run the following commands, so that we can be sure what things look like?\r\n`gem list rethinkdb` (on the client)\r\n`rethinkdb --version` (on the server)"
