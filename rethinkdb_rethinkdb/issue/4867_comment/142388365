      "@soplakanets Yes, dump/restore would count.\r\nI'm not recommending doing that just yet though.\r\n\r\nWe're still looking into how this issue could happen. We were just wondering if it could be something in the data. Is there a chance you could upload a new copy of your data directory (unfortunately you'll need to briefly shut down the server before making the copy)? I've enabled the `scp` access to our upload server again like last time."
