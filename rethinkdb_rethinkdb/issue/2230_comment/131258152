      "From recent experience (in particular https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4619), I think it's almost strictly preferable to use as similar a configuration for every build as possible. This is particularly true on OS X, where many people are installing through Homebrew and not using the .dmg.\r\n\r\nSo I think it's a good idea to not make this be passed in through the environment, but to have this as a part of our default CXX flags that are filled in by `configure`.\r\n\r\nAs I understand, the effect of this flag is primarily that you get a compilation error rather than a runtime error if you're using a newer feature. So I don't think it's *critical* to use it for all libraries, though probably preferable.\r\n\r\n@AtnNn You mention in the other issue that the build system wasn't designed for applying our build configuration to the external dependencies. Would it be possible to special case this flag in the existing system (maybe similar to the `-stdlib=libc++` work-around)?"
