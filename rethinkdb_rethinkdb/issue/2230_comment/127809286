      "https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4619 suggests that there is some bug that happens when building on 10.7, but not on 10.9.\r\n\r\nWe should do this for 2.2.\r\n\r\n\r\nReview 2130 was cancelled, but most of the disagreement seemed to stem from subjective questions about what's the \"right\" thing to do. The latest implementation in the review looks ok to me though.\r\nThe only open technical question that I could see was whether this could cause incompatibilities due to the flag impacting header files, while not being passed into the `CXXFLAGS` for the libraries we're compiling (compare https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3473). I'm not too concerned about this though. The risk of this introducing an ABI incompatibility seems very very low.\r\n\r\n@AtnNn did you have any remaining technical concerns about this change (ignoring questions of whether this should be a buildbot flag or default etc.)?"
