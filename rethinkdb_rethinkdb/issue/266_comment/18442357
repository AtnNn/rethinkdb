      "Uh, HTTP API aside for a moment, what about the client driver interface? Only binding to the local network interface isn't enough. If I want my DB handled by another service (like MongoLab and MongoHQ for MongoDB) or even just another shard, without authentication, I can't do it without openly binding to an external network interface and giving every other app in the cluster/datacenter/world access to my database.\r\n\r\nI prototype my apps in a mock production environment. Right now, this is the one factor keeping me off of RethinkDB."
