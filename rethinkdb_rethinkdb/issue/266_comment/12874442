      "I also agree that this is a bad idea. It's difficult to get right and the end product will probably be pretty error prone too. For example suppose you wanted to do a basic banking app, you'd probably have a table of transactions with a user id field on each row. Now you'll need to express permissions based on a predicate over the rows. This gets complicated fast and the stakes of getting it wrong are really high."
