      "One more thought: another downside of this scheme is that folks running on VPS nodes would have to set up their own firewall rules, which is more complicated than setting up EC2 security groups. Arguably in this case passing around auth keys in plain text won't help them much anyway, so having good docs on how to set that up sounds like a better solution to me."
