      "When this was closed in 2013, was it closed in reference to @coffeemug's initial thought of HTTP API for browser-only apps (\8216if you expose the http api to people, they could write apps entirely in the browser without servers (which is really nice)\8217), or with reference to client driver access, which this issue morphed into?\r\n\r\nI would love to see an HTTP API, or anything that allowed me to write a purely client-side app, without anything server-side beyond RethinkDB\8212but I fully appreciate that this is likely beyond the scope of this project.\r\n\r\nEdit: I also fully appreciate that numerous other non-RethinkDB products have come out in the last 2.5 years to address this need :)"
