      "How would people feel about completely bare-bones access control scheme where:\r\n* You register an API key with the server over ssh (or maybe through the web interface).\r\n* All connecting clients send the API key when they open the connection.\r\n* The server rejects all connections without a valid API key.\r\n\r\n(In particular, this means no encryption, no per-database, per-table, or per-datacenter access control, etc. etc.)\r\n\r\nI think that's the bare minimum we could do, and we could probably do it fairly quickly (1.7 maybe?)."
