      "Redis-like-auth (single key, defined in the config file) seems pretty good for minimum viable feature, particularly if you make it clear that it's only for local or semi restricted EC2 traffic. TLS won't buy you much if someone can snoop internal Amazon traffic.\r\n\r\nSSL in mongo makes things pretty contorted at times, and adds another level of complexity to drivers ... things break frequently for hard to diagnose reasons. SSH tunneling or similar seems like a simpler way to teach drivers to speak securely."
