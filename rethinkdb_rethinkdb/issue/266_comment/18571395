      "> What about supporting a list of keys so different endpoints can have different connection credentials that can be revoked / changed at any time without disrupting other connections?\r\n\r\n@stuartpb -- That's a really cool idea (and probably very useful in production). I worry that this is a bit outside of the scope of a minimum-viable-feature as it would make things significantly more complicated and delay the release. If we go with the API key solution, I'd be inclined to do a single key for now, and then add support for multiple keys later if there's demand (but we'll wait to get some more feedback on this before deciding)."
