      "I don't see how either of those solve the problem in the future.  There is still no upgrade path that preserves the cluster configuration, so users would be required to recreate their entire configuration.\r\n\r\nBumping the serializer version should work to let the users know it's incompatible, but if we change the serializer version, we'll require them to reimport all their data without a very good reason.  I think we should have separate versions for each layer (i.e. serializer, btree, and metadata), as well as an easy path to migrate a cluster."
