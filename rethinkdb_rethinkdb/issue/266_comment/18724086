      "@mrkurt -- I'm curious why it's necessary to implement an auth key for EC2 at all. Here's one possible way to implement security without it:\r\n\r\n* Put all the nodes in the cluster in one EC2 security group and allow cluster connections only within that security group. This way only authorized nodes can connect to the cluster.\r\n* Add a rule to this security group allowing client driver connections from all the groups where the clients run.\r\n* Set up a reverse proxy for the web UI that uses http authentication.\r\n\r\nThe only downside I can see for this scheme is that client drivers can't connect to the nodes from outside of EC2 (e.g. my laptop) without first ssh'ing into one of the authenticated EC2 machines (or using an SSH tunnel). I have two questions:\r\n\r\n1. Am I missing anything?\r\n2. How important/common is it for client drivers to connect from outside of EC2? I can see it being annoying that I can't connect to an EC2 host from my laptop easily, but arguably if I'm running on EC2 already, my client drivers should run there as well.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"
