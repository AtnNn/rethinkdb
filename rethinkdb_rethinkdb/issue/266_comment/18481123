      "As an access control system, has any consideration been given to utilizing TLS?  My thought is to have this work by creating a certificate authority (CA) for a DB cluster, a certificate would be issued for each server, and client (and cluster) connections would be have their client certs verified as issued by the same CA.\r\n\r\nUpsides would be: encrypted communication, very secure, could be applied to client->server & cluster->cluster & web interface, well supported by a variety of client environments, should be equally compatible with using only one network port.\r\n\r\nDownsides: requires incorporating a library dependency (like openssl, gnutls, etc.), relatively complex server configuration (although could be aided by automated tools), and it might not be a good precursor to a \"fine-grained\" access control system."
