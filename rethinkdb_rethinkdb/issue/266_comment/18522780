      "This issue had a slightly different original intention, but since The People took it in the direction of client driver access, we'll treat it this way.\r\n\r\nWe'll likely need some version of this for some cool things we're doing internally, so I'm moving this to 1.6. I'm not 100% sure it'll make it, but the odds are good, FYI.\r\n\r\nWe'll figure out specifically what to do this week."
