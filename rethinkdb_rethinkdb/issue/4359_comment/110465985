      "There appear to be different problems here.\r\n1. `validate_pb` can also cause stack overflows. We can easily add a check there as well. This was what initially crashed the server after I had increased the required free stack size for query compilation and then ran the even more deeply nested query\r\n2. It *appears* like on OS X we somehow have to account for the protected guard page twice. Or I'm overseeing something.\r\n3. Even with 1 fixed and the required stack space bumped up from 4 KB to 8 KB, I can still trigger a crash even on Linux if I just make the query deep enough. There must be something else that uses stack space proportional to nesting depth."
