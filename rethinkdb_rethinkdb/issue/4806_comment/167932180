      "I have, 2 servers with a table that has 1 shard (marked as shard1), and 2 replicas - the 'primary replica' on the current server, and the 'secondary replica' on the second server.\r\n\r\nThen I kill server 2. I expected the primary server to not be bothered in the slightest since it has the primary, just a secondary replica, an echo of itself, has gone missing.\r\n\r\nInstead the primary becomes unreadable and returns `'Cannot perform read: primary replica for shard [\"\", +inf) not available ` for any query.\r\n\r\nI am no longer able to make any changes, such as forcing the primary to forget about the secondary and just carry on.\r\n\r\nTo frustrate matters, since I'm using dockers I can fire up a hundred more new secondary in the cluster but since they have random names I can't slip in a replacement for the server it's looking for. Nor can make any readjustments to the replication as it times out - I wonder if it's trying to contact the dead server."
