      "Thanks for the pointer @mglukhovsky - I guess I expected a missing secondary replica to have no impact, and the table config had a primary specifically chosen - no no primaries were missing, so nothing to have voted on.  I'm going to continue testing with a minimum of 3 nodes per cluster from now on. I felt that the failure when there were just 2 was amplified since I resolved the issue by manually emergency repairing each table (which set the missing node as disconnected), then reduce the replication to 1, table by table.  Once I had done this, I was free to create new replicas on other nodes."
