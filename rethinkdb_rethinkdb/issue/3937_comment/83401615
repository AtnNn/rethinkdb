      "I put this into the Python driver refactor (for #2622), which is up in review 2732.  This includes two new exceptions:\r\n\r\n* `RqlTimeoutError` - raised when an operation times out (typically `connect` or `Cursor.next`)\r\n* `RqlCursorEmpty` - raised when attempting to iterate past the end of a cursor (only used in the Tornado implementation at the moment, but I may make it more ubiquitous before this hits `next`).\r\n\r\nChanged the driver's exception class structure a bit to facilitate this.  Before, `RqlDriverError` inherited from exception rather than `RqlError`, because `RqlError` was only for errors on a query, with a backtrace.  Now `RqlError` is the base class for all python driver exceptions, and `RqlQueryError` now inherits from it and forms the base class for `RqlRuntimeError`, `RqlCompileError`, and `RqlClientError`."
