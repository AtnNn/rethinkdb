      "Good idea.\r\n\r\nMost of the time new drivers are released together with new server releases, and the server changelog includes the driver changes. However, as you say, this is not always the case. Even when they do, the driver version numbers don't generally correspond to the server versions, making the right changelog for a particular driver release hard to find.\r\n\r\nWe'll try doing this with RethinkDB 2.4."
