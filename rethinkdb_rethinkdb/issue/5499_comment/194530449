      "Sorry for the confusion, I wasn't even thinking about the `if` case just now because it's skipped for IE10.\r\n\r\nBut yes, that's right. This change only affects IE10, not the tests (which have `__proto__`). I tested it manually by adding that `return` keyword in the `ast.js` under node_modules for a test app. As long as the output JS code contains `return this;` in the `else` clause, it'll work as expected."
