      "The cost to leaving it around undocumented is that it bitrots and makes the code more complicated.\r\n\r\nI think it's fairly unlikely that many (read: any) people are heavily attached to using a non-identity base with `gmr` in the wild; I would be happy just zapping it.  (That said, there's also something to be said for undocumenting and deprecating a feature for a few releases before dropping it entirely.)\r\n\r\nAny thoughts, @coffeemug ?"
