      "I have a bit of a preference for not entirely removing the base on gmr. We could make it undocumented. The main reason being that if someone is using it for something it'll really suck to have them show up in IRC and ask where it's gone to and unlike with `reduce` we can't just tell them to use `default` it's actually hard to get the same meaning without a base. Admittedly this might be overly paranoid but I don't see a huge cost in leaving it around undocumented and maybe it makes someone happy."
