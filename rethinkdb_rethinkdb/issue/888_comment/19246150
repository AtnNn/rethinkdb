      "I'm of the opinion that we shouldn't overly restrict ourselves to offer a backwards compatibility API until we explicitly decide we're ready to do that. If we worry too much about backwards compatibility now, we'll be stuck with a whole bunch of issues that we could easily avoid. Our community has been very understanding of this, and I think we should try and take advantage of it whenever possible.\r\n\r\nFor GMR, very few people are using it now (arguably because it's been poorly documented), and the people that are are experts. I don't think dropping the base will phase them, so I think we should drop it completely.\r\n\r\n(I also don't like the idea of leaving things undocumented -- it smells too much of \"we can't decide so let's try and have our cake and eat it too\")"
