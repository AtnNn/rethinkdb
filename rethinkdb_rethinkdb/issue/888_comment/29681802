      "Please only remove this from the user facing API. Maybe make it an internal flag like we have with things in the past. We need this to cleanly implement things like `sum` and `is_empty` in terms of map/reduce. Having bases will make things like `sum` a very simple 3 line rewrite rule that works everywhere and distributes to shards but without bases we'll have to write much more complicated code that spans several layers of the clustering stack.\r\n\r\nFor those interested in an example `sum` will be implemented as:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nstream.sum(f)\r\n# desugars to\r\nstream.map(f).reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, 0)\r\n```"
