      "Thanks for reporting this @slevr .\r\n\r\nThis was just a glitch with how the version number was generated in this executable. If you want to make sure that you're running the 2.3.4 binary, you can check the version in the web UI when clicking on the gear symbol at the top of the UI. It should display `2.3.4-windows` there.\r\n\r\nWe decided to not replace the zip archive, since that would change its checksums. Instead this issue will be addressed by the next release (2.3.5). See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5851"
