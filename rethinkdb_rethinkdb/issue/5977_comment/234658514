      "@tve Are you actually using `r.literal()` here without any arguments? That would imply that the field should get deleted. Or are you actually passing something into `r.literal` to replace the field if it exists, and insert it otherwise?\r\n\r\nOur discussion above was mostly assuming an empty `r.literal`. Non-empty `r.literal` would need to be handled like the values that are inside of them indeed.\r\n\r\n@mlucy Actually I'm now thinking that \"hiding\" `LITERAL`s when reading from a `datum` might be a bad idea. It might complicate comparing datums, and seems bug-prone. I think the best option might be just traversing both sides completely during a `merge` and stripping out the literals when doing that. I think we already have a function that does that. We just need to call it in a few additional cases."
