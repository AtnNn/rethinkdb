      "@s3tqr2w That's very weird. I don't think anything that's part of a backup should do any forking. Are the extra processes you're seeing coming from the `rethinkdb dump` / `rethinkdb export` command or from the server itself?\r\n\r\nAs long as you use neither `r.js` nor `r.http`, the server should only ever have two processes (though one of them will have a bunch of threads in it).\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, `rethinkdb export` also uses threads rather than forking child processes, and it should already be limited to 3 tables by default. Though I'm not sure if we're still creating all the threads and only 3 of them are active at a time, or if we only create 3 threads at a time. (pinging @Tryneus )"
