        "@wojons had a table replicated over multiple nodes. He had two secondary indexes on the table.\nWhen he removed one node as a replica for the table, he noticed a high load value (>100) on that node and heartbeat timeouts occurred.\n\nA possible explanation is that RethinkDB went into swap.\n\nThe problem is that this scenario is heavily under-tested (impact of removing a replica from a node).\nIf the going into swap explanation is correct, then why did it suddenly use to much memory?\nIf it is incorrect, what in RethinkDB is hogging the CPU for so long that heartbeat timeouts happen?\n"
