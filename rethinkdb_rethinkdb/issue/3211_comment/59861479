      "@sfguy, I haven't taken a long look into the data, but it appears to not be valid unicode.  The character won't show up with a grep because it is stored as the binary of `0xEF`, not the literal string `\\xef`.  I ran a quick test to find the problem lines and found errors on 128 lines.  Here is the script I used:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\r\nf = open('./npidata_20050523-20140907.csv', 'r')\r\n\r\nline_num = 0\r\nfor line in f:\r\n    try:\r\n        x = line.encode('utf-8')\r\n    except UnicodeDecodeError as ex:\r\n        print \"error on line %d, column %d\" % (line_num, ex.args[2])\r\n    line_num = line_num + 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to insert this sort of data, you should be using `r.binary`, otherwise you should sanitize your data so that it is valid UTF-8.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions or concerns regarding this.  Leaving this issue open until I hear from you.\r\n\r\n"
