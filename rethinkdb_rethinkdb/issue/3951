        "Currently when the server processes a STOP query, it may error if the token is not found.  This is actually really annoying for the drivers (especially with parallel query execution) because it is a race condition whether or not the original query will still be running by the time the STOP query is processed.\r\n\r\nIt should be simple enough to just always return SUCCESS_SEQUENCE for a STOP query whether or not a query was actually interrupted."
