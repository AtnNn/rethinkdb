Start a rethinkdb instance and open the data explorer.\n2. r.tableCreate('foo')\n3. r.table('foo').get('a')\n\nYou'll get the spinner icon and it'll hang forever.\n\nThis behavior is present in v1.11.1, v1.11.x, and next.\n\nRunning from the Python driver it just returns None, so the problem seems not to be on the server side of things.  (Maybe it's on the HTTP server interface side though.)\n\n(Could this have something to do with our partly dropping protobufs and returning json return values?)\n"
