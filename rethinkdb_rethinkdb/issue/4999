        "It would be nice if there was a `start_time` on the output of `rethinkdb.jobs`, supplementing the current `duration_sec` value. The advantage to this field would be that this value would not change, so it could easily be included on a changefeed without losing a method of (client-side) calculating duration. The only downside is that the value would be provided by the server generating the record, and so would expose any clock skews that are currently paved-over with the `duration_sec` value."
