      "In case multi indexes are a point of interest: I noticed in my logs that just before the crash (at 12:28:03,100) there was a write to a multi-index field, a list of strings. A `set_insert()` I believe.\r\n\r\nThere are changefeeds that receives events from that write, but the index itself isn't mentioned in the query (the indexed `order_by()` is on a time stamp field).\r\n"
