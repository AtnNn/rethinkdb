      "@coffeemug : Since the data explorer only way to get data without using a driver then complication should not be a issue. However the data explorer itself is already complicated I believe. My problem is I can't use it without limit() for heavy documents (such as raw XML data) It is really annoying.\r\n\r\nBy the way; I didn't ask default document limit for per page actually. I just need CLI on shell. (It would be awesome with pipe support.)"
