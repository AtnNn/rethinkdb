      "I took a quick look at this bug. \r\n\r\nThe reason why the graph of the tab in the back looks shitty is because this tab didn't have focus when the graph was drawn. If you keep to interface side by side, the results is almost the same.\r\n\r\nCubism probably does some lazy evaluation and somehow fails and does the spiky line.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have to dig a little in cubism to fix that. I'll take a look at the end of the week or next week. I have a few things (more important) to finish."
