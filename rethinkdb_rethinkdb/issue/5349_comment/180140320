      "I am also unable to reproduce the time related failures. With `rethinkdb-windows-alpha3`, I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> r.epoch_time(1436428422.339).in_timezone('-08:00').date().to_iso8601().run()\r\nu'2015-07-08T00:00:00-08:00'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the failures you see happen because RethinkDB is behaving differently in your environment. A quick look at the source seems to indicate that RethinkDB uses `%m` to format the month, which the boost documentation tells me is a two-digit representation. More investigation is required."
