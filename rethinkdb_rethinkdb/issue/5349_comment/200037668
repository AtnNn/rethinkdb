      "Hmm the fact that just round-tripping through the JSON protocol introduces rounding errors is a bit weird though, isn't it?\r\nWe are setting `RAPIDJSON_PARSE_DEFAULT_FLAGS=kParseFullPrecisionFlag` in our `build.mk` make file. @AtnNn is that getting applied on Windows too or might we somehow not hit that definition with the Windows build system?"
