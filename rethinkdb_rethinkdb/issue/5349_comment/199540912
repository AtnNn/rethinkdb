      "I am a bit late in commenting, but I think that this is just normal floating point storage issues. Because we are not doing anything to make sure that we have only a single flowing point implementation, we should expect small rounding errors like this. Usually I would expect it more in things that involve math (e.g.: multiplication), but this still looks like valid behavior to me.\r\n\r\nI will probably just put an appropriate range allowance on these tests, since they are more precise than floating point actually allows."
