        "2.2 added the `SERVER_INFO` response type enum with value 5. However in previous versions of RethinkDB (prior to 2.0) the response type enum 5 was used for `SUCCESS_FEED`. When implementing support for the `SERVER_INFO` query type, I ran into this, as we had old code around which still supported `SUCCESS_FEED` responses. It's an easy fix, but others may run into this too.\r\n\r\nIt could be good in the future when removing a field or enum from the protobuf definition to [reserve](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto?hl=en#reserved) it to make sure that you don't reuse previously defined fields?\r\n\r\n#3934"
