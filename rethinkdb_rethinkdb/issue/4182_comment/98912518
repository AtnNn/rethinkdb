      "Table configuration issues we need to report:\r\n\r\n* Some server(s) listed in the config are unavailable, but the table is still available for reads and writes.\r\n* The table is unavailable for writes, but auto-failover should kick in any second now.\r\n* We've lost a quorum for one or more shards, so auto-failover is impossible and we can't perform writes (on this side of the netsplit, anyway). Variant: we've also lost a quorum for the table as a whole.\r\n* None of the servers hosting the table are available, so we couldn't even fetch the config.\r\n* All servers are available, but the table's write ack setting is too high to be satisfiable for some shards, so the table is not available for writes.\r\n\r\nFor any given table we should report at most one of the above issues. If multiple issues apply for different shards, we should report whichever one is more severe. We're already doing something similar in 2.0, but the details of the issues and how to detect them are different."
