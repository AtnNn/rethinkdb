        "@mlucy had the idea of adding a piece of information to the data explorer that shows the type of the evaluated query. It could be next to the latency information, or possibly somewhere else, and we'd say whether the user got an array, a cursor, or a grouped data. The type information could link to the documentation on return types, which I think would be extremely nice.\r\n\r\nLeaving in subsequent for now."
