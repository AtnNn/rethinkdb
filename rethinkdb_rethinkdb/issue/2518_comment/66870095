      "For what it's worth I don't care which version of Unicode we standardize on (a decision effectively determined by the version of ICU we decide to use).  Unicode 7 added things like Mende Kikakui, which is used by less than 500 people.  While I think it would be tragic if one of them tried to use our database and couldn't, I doubt it's worth worrying about."
