      "Incidentally I checked other implementations for consistency on this.  Python does not appear to support `split('')`.  Ruby and node.js give the following results (here U+00E9 is \233 and U+0301 is the combining character for that accent):\r\n```ruby\r\nirb(main):001:0> \"f\\u00e9oo\".split('')\r\n=> [\"f\", \"\233\", \"o\", \"o\"]\r\nirb(main):002:0> \"fe\\u0301oo\".split('')\r\n=> [\"f\", \"e\", \"\769\", \"o\", \"o\"]\r\n```\r\nand for node\r\n```javascript\r\n> \"f\\u00e9oo\".split('')\r\n[ 'f', '\233', 'o', 'o' ]\r\n> \"fe\\u0301oo\".split('')\r\n[ 'f',\r\n  'e',\r\n  '\769',\r\n  'o',\r\n  'o' ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that this is simply wrong.  Whatever you are using `split('')` for, it is not well served by it handing you an accented quotation mark.  I asked a friend of mine who doesn't have any particular interest in Unicode about it, and she agrees that, no matter what the actual codepoints look like, '\769 is a crime against God and Man alike.\r\n\r\nIf there is interest, we could probably add a `decompose` function that would actually split based on codepoints instead of semantically.  I expect that almost no one would use it, however."
