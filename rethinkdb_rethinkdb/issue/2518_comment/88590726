      "#2950 comes to mind.  There's the upcase/downcase thing, which is unicode unawares but not unicode-breaking.  `r.js` needs to be inspected, but I'm not especially concerned because JS strings are supposed to be UTF-8 anyway.  I will probably need to give `r.match` a once over to be sure.\r\n\r\nWe just don't have very many string operations at present."
