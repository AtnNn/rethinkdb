      "How would you specify r.desc and r.asc with the index syntax?\r\nIf we can pass a function, it means that in Python/JS, I can do stuff like\r\n```\r\ntable.orderBy(r.row(\"foo\")(\"bar\"))\r\n```\r\nWhich makes a lot of sense considering the current API.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I pass a comparison function? I'm not sure how useful that is and I guess it's hard to efficiently implement."
