      "For this discussion it's important to note the distinction between order by and sort. Ordering requires transforming values into values we already know how to sort, numbers and strings mostly. Sorting requires a comparison function. Order by is nice sugar for the most common sorts but is less generic than sort.\r\n\r\nIf we define generic order by we still may also want to define generic sort. Note also, however, that order by index cannot be accomplished by generic sort."
