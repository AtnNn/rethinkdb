      "@atnnn I'd still like to change the function signature of r.add etc. We can discuss other modifications that may be necessary to support this feature in #1320 which I just opened for that discussion.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug This fix would actually change the behavior to be more consistent with the JS driver which has a minimum argument limit (though this is currently set to 1, we should probably change this to 2)."
