      "That seems right to me. What about the others?\r\n\r\nA (semi)exhaustive search suggests that the following terms currently accept 1 argument and do nothing to it:\r\n\r\n* add\r\n* sub\r\n* mul\r\n* div\r\n\r\nFirstly, am I missing anything? Secondly, should we change any of the other three to require 2 arguments? I'd be in favor of doing it for all of them but I'm not familiar with the arguments in favor of unary add etc.\r\n\r\nWhatever we decide, the expected behavior should be encoded in polyglot tests."
