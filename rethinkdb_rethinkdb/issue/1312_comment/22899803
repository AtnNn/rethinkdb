      "As far as I'm concerned, this issue is about a bug in the signature of `r.add` and friends. It just so happens that there is an unintended, undocumented feature that was blocked by this bug. I'm still going to fix this bug. Any subsequent proposal would then center on the question of documenting this latent functionality as an official feature."
