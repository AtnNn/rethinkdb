      Just
        "During a backfill, servers that never had any data for the table will sometimes report their status as `offloading_data` or `erasing_data`. This is because the `reactor_t::be_nothing()` coroutine is restarted every time the sharding scheme changes, and it waits until the backfill is complete before it goes into the `ready` state, even if it has no data. The solution is to have `reactor_t::be_nothing()` check if we're holding any data, and if not, it should skip to the end instead of offering backfills and waiting for the other peers to be ready.\n"
