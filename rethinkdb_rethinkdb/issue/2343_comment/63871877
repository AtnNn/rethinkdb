      "@danielmewes This is the bug we were just talking about. And my opinion has evolved to: make the import limited to all of the errors plus a `r` and `rethinkdb` objects, both pointing at the same object.\r\n\r\nCreating that object is going to be slightly annoying since all of the objects that are normally bound to r are going to have to be tied to those."
