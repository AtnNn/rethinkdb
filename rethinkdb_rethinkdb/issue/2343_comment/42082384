      "If I were a user and I wrote `import * from rethinkdb`, I think I would rather get an error (if that's possible) telling me to import it as `r`, possibly with a link to some documentation or a FAQ entry.\r\n\r\nWe use too many common names for `import *`, IMO, and all our documentation uses the `r.` prefix.  It also makes the interface more consistent across languages."
