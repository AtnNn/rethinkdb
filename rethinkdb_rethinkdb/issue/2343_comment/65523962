      "This has been merged into `next` with 1e1c3cf. For the record, `from rethinkdb import *` gets the following objects in the namespace: `r, rethinkdb, RqlError, RqlClientError, RqlCompileError, RqlRuntimeError, RqlDriverError` where r and rethinkdb are identical objects that work as you would expect. This makes our documentation \"just work\" regardless of how people import."
