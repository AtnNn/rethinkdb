      "An alternate that I have just been playing with would be to define __all__ in the __init__.py file. That only comes into play when you 'form blah import *', and would allow us to define a subset of things that would be imported into the top level namespace. I am still working out what that subset should look like  since we don't always start with a connection object, but I think that there is a workable option along this road."
