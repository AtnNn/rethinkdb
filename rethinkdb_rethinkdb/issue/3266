        "We've been discussing an optarg to `run()` that controls whether servers, tables, and databases are identified by name or by UUID in pseudo-tables. Here's a more detailed proposal for discussion.\n\nThe opt-arg will be called `identifier_format`; legal values are `\"uuid\"` and `\"name\"`. It affects the following things\n- In `table_config`, `identifier_format` controls if servers in the config are identified by name or UUID.\n- In `table_status`, `identifier_format` controls if servers are identified by name or UUID.\n- In `issues`, `identifier_format` controls how servers, tables, and databases in the `info` field are identified.\n- In `jobs`, `identifier_format` controls how servers, tables, and databases in the `info` field are identified, as well as servers in the `servers` field.\n- In `stats`, the `server` and `table` fields will be names or UUIDs depending on `identifier_format`.\n\nIt doesn't affect the following things:\n- In `table_config`, `table_status`, `db_config`, `server_config`, and `server_status`, the `id` and `name` fields are always both present, and the `id` field is always the primary key, regardless of `identifier_format`.\n- In `stats`, the primary keys will always be of the form `[\"table\", <UUID>]`, `[\"server\", <UUID>]`, etc. even if `identifier_format` is `\"name\"`. (@danielmewes: Your https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2885#issuecomment-61192738 appears to contradict my proposal here, but I'm not sure.)\n\nThoughts?
