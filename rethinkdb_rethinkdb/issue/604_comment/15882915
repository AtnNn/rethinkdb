      "I'm sorry, but I *really* don't want to reopen this topic. Despite looking similar, arrays and cursors are different things, and trying to provide the same interface to the two is a pandora's box. We actually managed to *close* this box last time. We had the strength to send the demons back once, I don't know if we'll be able to summon this much strength again.\r\n\r\n(I do agree that it's inconvenient. We should probably allow explicit `coerceTo('stream')` in ReQL to let you get a cursor if you really want it.)"
