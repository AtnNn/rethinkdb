      "#221 mainly discuss about the style of the callbacks.\r\nI don't see anywhere that the callback can be called on an array (except if an array is atomic?).\r\n\r\nI'll leave this issue closed for now, but I'm really not convinced that we should keep it like that. From my point of view, it's currently and by far the most annoying thing in the new JavaScript driver. \r\nI'll probably try to talk about that with you tomorrow."
