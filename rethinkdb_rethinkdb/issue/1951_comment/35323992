      "> This would work well, because whenever we modify a blob, we just rewrite it completely anyway.\r\n\r\nNot that this may not be the case forever, so I wouldn't count on this functionality. There is a lot of demand for incremental document updates (i.e. incrementing a counter in a large doc shouldn't affect the whole doc). We can get away with things as they are for now, but I don't think we'll be able to get away with it forever."
