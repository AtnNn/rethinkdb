      "Working on this now.\r\nI'm cutting out the replication timestamp for blob blocks, which saves 16 bytes per such block (8 bytes in the in-memory LBA, and 8 bytes in the buffer cache).\r\nI'm also reducing the block size from 32 to 16 bit. We currently only use block sizes up to 4 KB, so this is still plenty.\r\n\r\nI'm keeping the on-disk format unchanged, so that we can easily revert any of these changes later if for example we want to support blocks of more than 64 KB at some point."
