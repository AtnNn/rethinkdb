        "After actually writing real queries, I think `r.join(a, b)` is orders of magnitude nicer than `a.join(b)`. I think that in general we should adopt the following philosophy for the infix/prefix business:\r\n\r\n1. Operations that accept multiple sequences should be prefix\r\n2. Math and logic should be accessible via infix, prefix, and overloaded ops if the language allows it\r\n3. Beyond that (with stuff like `[]` for `nth` and `[:]` for `slice`, we probably shouldn't use operator overloading because it tends to be annoying and confusing in practice)"
