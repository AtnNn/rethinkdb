        "Whenever the user writes to the `rethinkdb.table_config` pseudo-table or permanently removes a machine, we call an internal function `table_elect_directors()` to select new directors for the table. As part of my work on #2853, I made a barely-usable stub implementation of this function. It needs to be finished before we can ship the ReQL admin API.\r\n\r\n(Clarification: In #2858 we decided not to expose `table_elect_directors()` to the user, but it still exists internally.)"
