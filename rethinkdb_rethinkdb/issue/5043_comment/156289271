      "@sontek Since the `asyncio_query` is using a `filter`, RethinkDB actually has to read all documents for checking whether the filter criteria matches for each of the queries.\r\nIf you switch that to `.getAll(survey_id, {index: \"survey_id\"})` I suspect that the reads/s graph will match up."
