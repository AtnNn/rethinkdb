      "I think doing these leads to inconsistencies about what `reconfigure` actually does. See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3230#issuecomment-60178542\r\n\r\nI think a command to rebalance shard boundaries *without* changing the servers that are involved would be useful. This should be a separate command I think, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2981"
