      "Hi Daniel,\r\n  Chrome 52 will not currently allow me access to the admin site at all:\r\n\r\n>\"You cannot visit aws-us-east-1-portal9.dblayer.com right now because the website sent scrambled credentials that Google Chrome cannot process\"\r\n\r\nUbuntu updated Firefox to V48 today, and I'm still able to advance to the admin site. So far, I haven't been able to re-create the error.  The only error that I've had is when I try too large of a maxDist value.  For example:\r\n\r\n>var point = r.point(-122.422876,37.777128); r.db('geo_test').table('geo').getNearest(point, {index: 'location', maxDist: 7050, unit: 'mi'})\r\n\r\n>e: The distance has become too large for continuing the indexed nearest traversal.  Consider specifying a smaller `max_dist` parameter.  (Radius must be smaller than a quarter of the circumference along the minor axis of the reference ellipsoid.  Got 11501765.127301588655m, but must be smaller than 9985163.1855612862855m.) in:\r\nr.db(\"geo_test\").table(\"geo\").getNearest(r.point(-122.422876, 37.777128), {\"index\": \"location\", \"maxDist\": 7050, \"unit\": \"mi\"})\r\n\r\nThis error is very clear, and makes allot of sense.  Since I can't recreate the intermittent error I was having, it's probably best to mark this closed and get it off the books.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-- Nick\r\n\r\n"
