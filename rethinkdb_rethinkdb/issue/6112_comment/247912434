      "Hi Brian,\r\n\r\nRight, tracked it down. v2.3.0 has this problem, while v2.3.3 doesn't.  Upgrading to v2.3.3 has solved the problem. Looks like we were not keeping as up-to-date as we thought.\r\n\r\nSorry for the bother. Should have checked that first myself. I made a false assumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
