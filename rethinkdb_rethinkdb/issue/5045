        "Our current truncated key tests test the simplest cases.  We should have tests that intersperse keys with the following properties:\n- Truncated to the minimum length.\n- Truncated to less than the minimum length.\n- Longer than the minimum truncation length, but not truncated.  (Ideally there would be some truncated keys that are both longer and shorter than these.)\n- Exactly at the minimum truncation length.\n\nWe should then test:\n- Ordering them forward and backward.\n- Getting a range on them (both with and without ordering, those take different paths). \n\nWe should have the following general properties:\n- Small batch sizes.\n  - Ideally we'd run the same test with multiple batch sizes.  I've been testing with batch sizes 1, 10, and unset in my recent tests.\n- Multiple range shards.\n- Autogenerated primary keys (so that there's no predictable store key ordering in the truncated case).\n"
