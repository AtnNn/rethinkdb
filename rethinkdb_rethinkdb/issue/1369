        "I sent this benchmark over e-mail to @mlucy and @jdoliner, but I'm going to post it here instead for collaboration.\n\nHere's the initial setup I think we should focus on (based on all the data I've collated):\n- A cluster of five RethinkDB nodes\n- One large table with ~1 billion documents (event data -- clickstream, network logs, etc.)\n  - Each document 1-2KB in size\n  - Has the following fields: autogen ID, datetime of the event, customer_id (which customer generate the event), type of event (i.e. user click, network packet, etc.), a bunch of other data (irrelevant what it is, just has to fill up the docs to 1-2KB)\n  - Secondary indexes on datetime, customer_id, type of event\n- Five shards\n- Two replicas, two write acks\n- Hard durability\n\nAnd here's the workload:\n- Constant insert rate of ~5m docs per day (~60 docs/second) -- a total of 16 clients\n- Run queries of the following form\n  1. Read a random event event with an id X -- run this query ~1000 times/second, a total of 32 clients\n  2. Give me all events of type X for customer Y at time period Z (where time period is about a month) -- run this query once per second, a total of two clients\n  3. Give me all events for customer Y -- run this query ten times per second, a total of 8 clients\n  4. How many events happened for time period Z (where time period is about a month) -- run this query once per second, a total of 1 client\n- We should periodically drop clients and connect new ones (i.e. pick a random client and reconnect every second).\n\nStuff to look out for (i.e. requirements that will allow us to call this project done, and RethinkDB good):\n- Latency for write queries and point read queries should never exceed a well-bounded value (say, 5ms)\n- Latency for queries 2-4 shouldn't exceed a reasonable value (say, 20ms - 2s)\n- Time to connect shouldn't exceed a well bounded value (say, 10ms).\n\nWe'll also have to test adding a replica. When we bump the replica number by one, we have to test the following:\n- Make sure throughput doesn't drop/latency doesn't increase by a well defined number (e.g. 15%). If the number is higher than 15% it's a show-stopper since it will disrupt a real-time system.\n- How long does it take to add a replica? (should be a well-bounded number on our dataset, e.g. no more than 3-5 hours, with a reasonably correct progress bar). We don't do resharding without interrupting now, so we should only worry about adding replicas.\n"
