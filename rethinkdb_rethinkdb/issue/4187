        "Loosely related to #1408 and #3710.\r\n\r\nA fairly common use-case for me has been comparing dates and it would be nice to have some more powerful abstractions. Currently, if you want to get the number months that have passed since a given date you have to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.now().sub(<time>).div(60 * 60 * 24 * 30)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is error-prone and doesn't take into account the varying number of days in a month. I'd like to propose a new term, `time.diff` which would automatically handle rounding and the special-cases associated with varying month/year lengths:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntime.diff(<time>, <measurement>, <float>)\r\n\r\na = r.time(2015, 3, 2, 'Z')\r\nb = r.time(2015, 1, 1, 'Z')\r\n\r\na.diff(b, 'days') // -> 60\r\nb.diff(a, 'days') // -> -60\r\na.diff(b, 'months') // -> 2\r\na.diff(b, 'years') // -> 0\r\na.diff(b, 'years', true) // -> 0.1643835616438356\r\n```"
