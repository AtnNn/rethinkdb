      "By stateless, do you mean being able to randomly access any given page by index?\r\n\r\nIf we stored subtree counts in something like the LBA we could do this (related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/152).\r\nUnless we do some major re-architecturing of how LBA-like information is kept in memory, that would come at the cost of relatively hefty additional memory overhead though. I still don't really like this solution for that reason (and it's a lot of work).\r\n\r\nThere might be some other way to achieve this."
