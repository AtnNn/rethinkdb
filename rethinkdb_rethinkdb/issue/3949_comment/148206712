      "Parts 2 and 4 (distinguishing between blob blogs and other blocks in the serializer) are implemented in the fix for #1951.\r\n\r\nWhat's missing is adding subtree counts in the LBA, adding interfaces for retrieving and modifying them in the serializer and cache, and then integrating this with the btree modification and btree traversal code. That last part might be non-trivial.\r\nAlso backwards compatibility is something that we need to consider."
