      "I disagree on the UTC output to files. While it makes it a bit easier for someone who is comparing the raw files from multiple timezones, those people are the ones most likely to be using logging tools to aggregate there logs anyways, obliviating any advantage. For those with smaller clusters all in a single timezone (usually the one they are sitting in) having it in local time is much easier.\r\n\r\nFor our combined view in `rethinkdb.logs` I agree that we should display a single timezone, ideally the one of the user looking at the logs. But absent a good way to determine the proper timezone, I would be fine with UTC timezone in the outputted logs."
