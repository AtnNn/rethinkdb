      "It looks like our `logs` system table already uses UTC as the default timezone.\r\n\r\n@nighelles is currently working on the log system. We should use this as a chance to either switch to RFC 3339 dates with a timezone specification, or to UTC timestamps in the log file. I don't particularly care which, and users will be able to customize their output through syslog if it's important for them anyway.\r\nWhen changing the format, we should make sure that we don't fail when reading old log files. through the `logs` table. I think seeing wrong timezones for the old log entries (or even not seeing them at all) is acceptable though."
