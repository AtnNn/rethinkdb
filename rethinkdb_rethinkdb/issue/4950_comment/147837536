      "I agree with ISO 8601 timestamps (and we already have code to produce them for the related ReQL terms), but I think we should consider always outputting UTC timestamps.\r\n\r\nPutting UTC timestamps in our logs makes it easier to compare logs on servers in different geographic regions, and it also preserves the nice property that log entries are in lexicographic order."
