      "Ok, the problem is that `coro_t::move_to_thread()` is not always called from the thread that the coroutine was last running on. Apparently this is the case during the io_backender_t construction.\r\n\r\nI'm just going to revert ab625b240c49a789c89a41d9bb9a41ca7d692ae2. It was meant to fix the small annoyance that coroutines were accounted for on the thread that they were created on, rather than the one that they actually ended up running on. However I cannot see an easy way of fixing this now, at least not without moving `cglobals` out of thread local storage."
