      "This is very likely something that I broke (at least I added the assertion and the code that it asserts something about)\8206.\8206\r\n\r\n\8206Will fix this asap today.\r\n\r\nFYI: the assert is about debug-only things (coroutine accounting), and absolutely safe to ignore / comment out. We could tag and build 1.11 binaries regardless of this, as long as they are release mode builds.
