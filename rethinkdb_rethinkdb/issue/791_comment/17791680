      "Ok, the errors you are getting make sense. The documentation in the [startup guide](http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guides/startup/) refers to the behaviour of our custom init script:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/packaging/assets/init/rethinkdb\r\n\r\nThat script will, among other things, check if the pid file and directory options are missing from the config file, and fills in the new values. rethinkdb itself uses `./rethinkdb_data` as the data directory by default."
