      "I thought it might have been codemirror/CodeMirror#867, but it looks like that was fixed in 3.0, and according to [this line](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/admin/static/js/codemirror/codemirror.js#L5577) the version of CodeMirror we have should have fixed it (3.11).\r\n\r\nIt does seem like we can just disable lineWrapping [here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/admin/static/coffee/dataexplorer.coffee#L755), so that's an option.\r\n\r\nThe other option is to upgrade Codemirror (seems like our version is ancient) and it might fix this. Though I don't know how much custom hacking we did on it for typeahead etc. This seems riskier."
