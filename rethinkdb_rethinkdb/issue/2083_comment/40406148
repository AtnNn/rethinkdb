      "To be honest, given the fact that encoding/decoding network messages is a major source of CPU overhead right now, I think it would be best to always run up-to-date reads on the primary.\r\nIt's also more predictable, and avoids problems of increased latency for reads if a secondary is temporarily lacking behind with processing its write queue."
