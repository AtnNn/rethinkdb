      "@danielmewes -- nop, the table is not sharded.\r\n\r\nI've been running queries from the data explorer, hosted on the master. So my queries were going to the master (which is also the fast machine).\r\n\r\nAbout the up to date read to a secondary, I think yes we support it. We just have to go through the master first to be sure that we are going to see all the writes.\r\nBut you may want to ask someone else to confirm that."
