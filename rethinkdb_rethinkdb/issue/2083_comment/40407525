      "The proposal in #2119 only applies if the number of acks is the same as the number of replicas as far as I understand. The behavior in other cases would probably be unaffected.\r\n\r\nI'm going to go ahead and make the proposed change of always routing reads to the primary.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, we might want to decouple the process of getting in line with writes from the process of sending the query. So instead of sending the query to the primary, which then passes it on to one of the replicas, we could send it straight to a replica and the replica would turn to the primary to get something comparable to an order token. That would reduce the network overhead and serialization/deserialization overhead that comes with forwarding the whole query. For now it doesn't really seem necessary to make that change though."
