      "@neumino -- you're right, I forgot about that. This would be a much simpler fix, but we should consider it along with #2119 and think through various implications. I haven't had the chance yet to think of #2119 in detail, but I will as soon as everything in place to begin the clustering work.\r\n\r\nWe might want to make this fix before that, or wait. I'm not entirely sure -- let's look at it when @danielmewes or @Tryneus have the bandwidth to get to this issue."
