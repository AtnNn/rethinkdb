      "@ydnax -- thanks for the bug report!  That sounds like very strange behavior.\r\n\r\nThe `single_profile.json` in your gist seems to be two profiles pasted back-to-back, while `replica_profile.json` only has one.  Which profile in `single_profile.json` corresponds to the profile in `replica_profile.json`?\r\n\r\nAlso, a few questions about your cluster setup:\r\n* What version of RethinkDB are you using?\r\n* What are the specs of the slow and fast machine?\r\n  - In particular, do they have SSDs?\r\n* If you click on your table in the web UI, what does it say at the bottom under \"Servers used by this table\"?"
