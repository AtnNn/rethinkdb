      "> To be honest, given the fact that encoding/decoding network messages is a major source of CPU overhead right now, I think it would be best to always run up-to-date reads on the primary.\r\n\r\nOr use a smart algorithm that sends reads to whatever has been responding with the best latency, testing out slower replicas on some intervals to see if they've improved."
