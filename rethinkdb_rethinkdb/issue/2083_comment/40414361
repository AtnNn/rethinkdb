      "@danielmewes I would just use the replica that's on the same machine as the master for now -- we can optimize later.\r\n\r\n> Do you remember how that works or if that talk is available somewhere online?\r\n\r\nThis was 2002, it wasn't very detailed either... anyway generally speaking in our case we would just periodically send test no-op queries to replicas that we haven't read from in a while and track the latencies, choosing the right trade-off between sending too many test queries and lacking up-to-date information on a replica's latency."
