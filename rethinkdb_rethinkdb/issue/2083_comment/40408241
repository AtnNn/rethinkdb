      "@srh: That would certainly be an improvement. Though it sounds like it might be tricky to measure. Would latency be the mean latency at which servers answer queries? In that case we would have to be careful if some queries are more complex than others. Simply taking the network latency works in cases where some servers are in other data centers or have slower connections, But not in @ydnax 's case for example, where one server is just slower than the other (with network latency not being the issue)."
