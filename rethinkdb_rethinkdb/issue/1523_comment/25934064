      "Hi @Oxymore -- this would be possible, but I'm not sure if we want to do this. There are already great distributed filesystems, and we typically prefer to limit our scope but be really good at that. In order for us to add a feature like GridFS, we'd have to be convinced that it integrates into our architecture nicely (I think it would, but we'd have to debate it), and give a significant advantage to over users over existing dedicated solutions (e.g. HDFS). \r\n\r\nMoving to backlog for now, we'll come back to this when we get more time."
