      "@lavvy There's no size limit, though any given query is limited to 128 MB (so larger files would have to be inserted in multiple steps).\r\n\r\nHowever we don't recommend using the `r.binary` type for anything bigger than a few MB (maybe 16MB at most). It will become very slow and might cause high RAM usage on the servers. Solutions like ReGrid avoid these issues by splitting large files up into smaller chunks."
