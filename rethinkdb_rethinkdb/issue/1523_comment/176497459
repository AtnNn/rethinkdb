      "@coffeemug I created a repo so @bchavez and I can have a public 'spec' for RethinkDBFS.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/internalfx/rethinkdbfs-spec\r\n\r\nI have begun adapting the GridFS spec to RethinkDB. I would greatly appreciate having a member of the RethinkDB team check our work from time to time. My long term hope is that by having a spec, drivers could be easily created for other languages with full compatibility.\r\n\r\nIf anyone from your team is able to help I will gladly extend push access to the repo."
