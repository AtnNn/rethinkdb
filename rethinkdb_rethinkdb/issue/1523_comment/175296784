      "This is really cool, thanks for sharing!\r\n\r\nI think if you made the storage work literally the same way they do it in Mongo, you'd probably be ok. As far as performance goes, RethinkDB semantics are fairly similar to MongoDB, so if you use the same approach you probably won't run into problems. Let me know if you have specific questions. Also, I'm really excited about this library! Do you have a sense for when it'll be in a working state?"
