      "@lavvy Ah, Horizon will need separate support for this which currently doesn't exist (neither for storing on the file system nor inside the database). See https://github.com/rethinkdb/horizon/issues/186 \r\n\r\nReGrid itself stores the data directly in RethinkDB (including sharding and replication if configured)."
