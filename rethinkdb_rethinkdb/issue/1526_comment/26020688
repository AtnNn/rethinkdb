      "I'm not sure if I was clear in my description. The `reql_func_t` destructor and deserialization I was talking about were both inside of rdb_read_visitor_t::operator(const rget_read_t &). I assume that this is the deserialization / destruction of the sindex_mapping, which is deserialized from disk. Not the function given to eq_join in the query.\r\n\r\nPS: So to answer your question: This deserialization does not happen at all in the fast case."
