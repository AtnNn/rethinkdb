      "@linuxdynasty -- approximately how much data is in the DB? This might have to do with disk access rather than CPU.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you run the queries twice (i.e. run query A, then query B, then query A, then query B), what does the performance look like? It might be that query A warms up the cache so it takes longer, and then query B operates entirely in RAM. What happens if you run them twice (A, B, A, B) or reverse the order (B, A)?"
