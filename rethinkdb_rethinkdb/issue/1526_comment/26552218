      "I guess that might be a very easy change which would solve about half of the problem.\r\n\r\nNote that `acquire_sindex_superblock_for_read()` also takes significant CPU time. The profiling suggested that  `acquire_sindex_superblock_for_read()` and compiling+destructing the sindex function are responsible for roughly 30-40% of the CPU time spent in the index lookup each. So fixing any one of them should save ~30%."
