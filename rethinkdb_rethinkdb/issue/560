        "Using the sample 'tv_shows' table, I'm trying to find all the shows with the word \"star\" in them.  Here is my query:\n\n```\nr.db('test').table('tv_shows').filter(function(show) { return show('name').contains('star')})\n```\n\nBut I keep getting this error:\n\n```\nRqlRuntimeError: Expected type OBJECT but found STRING. in:\nr.table(\"tv_shows\").filter(function(var_23) { return var_23(\"name\").contains(\"star\"); })\n                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    \n```\n\nI've tried several things but nothing works.  Am I doing it incorrectly?  I tried to follow the filter() example in the Data Explorer interface but to no avail.\n\nThanx!\n  Richard\n"
