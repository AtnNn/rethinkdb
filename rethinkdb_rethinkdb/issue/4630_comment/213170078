      "Can we bump this issue? The dependency on EM is really awkward especially as EM does not fit well in the Ruby ecosystem and has fallen out of favor in the community for that reason. Big frameworks like RoR actively avoid EM.\r\n\r\nWould you accept a PR for this? Does the team approve of the name `#async_run`? A nice move would be to mark `#em_run` deprecated and keep it functional until 3.0."
