      "@danielmewes they usually do 2rc's with about a month between them, and the full release about a week after the 2nd rc, so if history is any indicator it could be within a week or two.\r\n\r\nThe interface will only be used by library implementors so I don't think it being a little bit technical should be an issue.\r\n\r\nI would offer to help with the implementation but unfortunately I'm moving next wednesday so I have a super busy weekend ahead of me :)"
