      "Also, it would be useful if the ruby driver could support async run() without requiring eventmachine. Or just support Fibers (e.g. switch the regular condition variable used in `@waiters` with https://github.com/igrigorik/em-synchrony/blob/master/lib/em-synchrony/thread.rb#L70-L125). Further, some people are fan of Celluloid, we might want to be able to integrate with such framework. So maybe the \"wait\" functionality should be abstracted away."
