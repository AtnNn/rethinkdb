      "It is unfortunate that so many DB creators don't recognize the need for this. We have been waiting for Mongo DB to implement this feature and they are finally in the process of getting it done. The only alternative to this is to use a large integer and assume a decimal. We are currently doing this with another DB and it is painful. Multiplying and dividing by a factor to store a value as an integer is really a pain. Queries also need to take this into account. We are in need of a document database and have been waiting for MongoDB to complete the feature. When we saw RethinkDB, we were really excited by the approach, and see it better than MongoDB, until we realized we were going to have to wait again. I know you have a lot to do, but I believe that many financial applications don't even look at a DB unless it handles fixed decimal. Your analysis of \"only two people over two years\" doesn't include all the people who look at your product, see it doesn't handle arbitrary precision, and just move on. I believe you will be surprised when you implement the feature how many people jump on board."
