      "@cumminsd Thanks for your comment. That's a valid argument.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to tell how many people dismiss RethinkDB because of missing support for arbitrary precision decimals, compared to any of the other missing features. As you point out, we probably don't hear from most people who would be interested in Rethink if it had a particular feature. Users who comment on Github are mostly users who are already using RethinkDB but are missing something in addition to what they're already using, not users who dismissed RethinkDB from the beginning because it was missing something absolutely critical to their use case.\r\n\r\nThat being said, one of our main focus is on realtime applications, often for the web. And I think that a few other features such as https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3997 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/746 are still a bit higher on the list of priorities than arbitrary precision decimals right now. We'll keep this one in mind though."
