      "For financial applications, you can simply store the amounts as an integer in smallest common currency unit. For example, 100 cents = $1.00. Stripe does this as well: https://support.stripe.com/questions/which-zero-decimal-currencies-does-stripe-support\r\n\r\nOur API returns values in the smallest common currency unit and only accepts values in the  smallest common currency unit (like Stripe), which alleviates a lot of the complexity here.\r\n\r\nAt display time, you have to add the currency symbol, commas, etc., so dividing by 100 is not onerous as an additional step.  We store _a lot_ of financial information in RethinkDB and the above approach works just fine for us."
