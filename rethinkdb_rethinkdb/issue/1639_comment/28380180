      "@iterion -- thanks for submitting this. For the next few releases we're exclusively focused on performance and stability, so this is unlikely to make it before the LTS release. I agree that the feature is important, and we'll try to get to it as soon as we can after LTS is out.\r\n\r\nMoving to backlog for now."
