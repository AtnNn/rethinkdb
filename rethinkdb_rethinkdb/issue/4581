        "Hi guys!\r\n\r\nSo, to quote the [RethinkDB documentation](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/architecture/#query-execution):\r\n\r\n> Currently, values obtained by executing JavaScript code, random values, and values obtained as a result of a subquery (e.g. incrementing the value of an attribute by the value of an attribute in a different document) cannot be performed atomically. If the user runs a query that cannot be executed atomically, by default RethinkDB will throw an error\r\n\r\nWhen I attempt to `update`, I get an error _as expected_. However, this feature behaves counter-intuitively when I begin doing upserts:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('FruitCollection').insert({ \r\n  id : 1, \r\n  fruits : r.table('otherCollection').get(1)('fruits').count()\r\n}, { \r\n  conflict : 'update' \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, this operation **is not atomic when updating** based on the documentation. Although, it doesn't throw an error which suggests it is atomic. However, what about this operation:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('FruitCollection').insert({ \r\n  id : 1, \r\n  fruits : r.table('FruitCollection').get(1)('fruits').default([]).append('orange')\r\n}, { \r\n  conflict : 'update' \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is far more confusing as well. It uses a subquery, which should not be atomic, however it only touches one document, which is supposed to be atomic. It doesn't throw an error, so I would be led to believe this is atomic, but neither does the first query so the behaviour is very confusing.\r\n\r\nWhat I would really like to do is this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('FruitCollection').insert({ \r\n  id : 1, \r\n  fruits : r.row.default([]).append('orange')\r\n}, { \r\n  conflict : 'update' \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut `r.row` is not supported when doing `insert`.\r\n\r\n1. Should these first two queries throw a non-atomic error and require a `nonAtomic` flag?\r\n2. Does it make sense to add `r.row` support to `insert`?\r\n3. If not, is there no way to atomically upsert using append/add/etc in Rethinkdb?\r\n\r\nI propose adding more clear documentation on atomicity to the pages on `insert`, and perhaps changing the behaviour to throw an error if it is not atomic. Thanks for all your hard work on Rethink!"
