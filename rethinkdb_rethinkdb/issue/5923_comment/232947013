      "We saw a nice drop in \"garbage\" space with the new binary... average table went from 13% to 7% saving us a ton of space.  However, here's a picture of a table that was backfilling after the relaunch with the new binary:\r\n```\r\n                bare_subscription_states   db1 21.9%   6.69 GiB  37.28 GiB\r\n                bare_subscription_states   db2  6.6%   2.08 GiB  33.81 GiB\r\n                bare_subscription_states   db3 22.3%   6.90 GiB  37.81 GiB\r\n```\r\nThose numbers are  Garbage%, GarbageSize, TotalSize\r\n1 & 3 are backfilling...\r\n\r\nWe did notice that the G% went up to ~22% on db-1 then went back down to 6%, as the backfill continued.  Admin UI was very sluggish during this time.\r\n"
