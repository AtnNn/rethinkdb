      "We've implemented some more efficiency improvements for the garbage collector. They are still in code review, but I think we'll wait with 2.3.5 and include them in that release.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if they are enough to fully resolve this issue (I suspect not quite), but they should make things a bit better. The changes also improve performance for heavy sustained write workloads, so they are an improvement regardless."
