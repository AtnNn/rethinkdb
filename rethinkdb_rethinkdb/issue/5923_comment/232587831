      "@danielmewes I have tested this on two systems:\r\n\r\n1. Arch linux with rethinkdb 2.3.1 (the repos are behind and building rethinkdb gives me an error)\r\n2. Ubuntu LTS 14.04 with rethinkdb 2.3.4\r\n\r\nI can test this the binary on either system. You can contact me on the rethinkdb slack.\r\nWe were also wondering if it is possible to defragment / garbage collect an existing database. Then it would be possible to reduce the size after importing."
