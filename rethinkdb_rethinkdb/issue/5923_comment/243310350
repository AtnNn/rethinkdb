      "@bsharpe @Calavoow RethinkDB 2.3.5, which we released today, includes a few efficiency improvements for the garbage collector. Those improvements are different from the ones that were in the testing binary that I had sent you before (the ones in RethinkDB 2.3.5 go further). I'm not certain if this fully solves the problem, but it should make it less severe. If you get a chance to try it out, I'd be interested in hearing what your results are."
