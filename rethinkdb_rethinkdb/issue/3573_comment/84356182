      "Thank you @danielmewes for your response. Got hit with this issue again today :-(. This has to be a concern for more than just me, I'd think? Or am I missing some obvious workaround? I could add independent timers (in JS) to timeout and give up on the response, etc, but this seems like a natural and important function for the driver? (admittedly the MySQL protocol doesn't seem to have a query timeout either :-) -- and I suppose there are data consistency issues to consider)."
