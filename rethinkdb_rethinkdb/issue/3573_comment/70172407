      "Thank you for the proposal @ravi .\r\n\r\nI'm actually not sure what our drivers are currently doing in this respect.\r\nWe have timeouts for the initial connection handshake in our drivers, but I don't think they apply for later query responses. I agree that it would be useful to have the maximum time to wait on a reply from the server configurable."
