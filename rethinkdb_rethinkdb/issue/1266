        "After some discussions with @mglukhovsky and @coffeemug and @neumino, @coffeemug admitted that having uppercase type names was backed entirely by specious reasoning and whimsy.  Everybody actually believes types should be lowercase, as evidenced by the dates proposal which had the type being written in lowercase.  For example, we have documentation that encourages people to write `coerceTo('string')`, but of course doing `r.expr(\"a\").typeOf().eq('string')` will not work.  The documentation does not say this or imply this (because the documentation sucks).\r\n\r\nTypes should be lowercase, `coerceTo` should not be case insensitive, and maybe error messages should still capitalize them.\r\n"
