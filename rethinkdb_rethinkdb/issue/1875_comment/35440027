      "Secondary index creation under reads (#1556) is still fine. There is a ~1-second drop in the QPS both when the index is created and when it is dropped. During post-construction itself the QPS are unaffected. Not sure if we had this in the old cache. It generally doesn't look critical though. (Edit: We didn't have the QPS drop when dropping an sindex. That's something worth investigating later)."
