      "On rotational drives, a mixed read/write workload (50/50 reads/writes, YCSB workload \"a\") with hard durability is faster in next (140 qps next vs. 115 qps 1.11).\r\nIn soft durability next is a lot slower (750 qps vs. 7700 qps for 1.11). That's because the unsaved data limit of 1.11 was never hit in this test though, so it just absorbed all of the writes into RAM.\r\n\r\nSeems ok."
