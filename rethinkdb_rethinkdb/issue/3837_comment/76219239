      "Hi @alimoeeny, which file system are the data files stored on (inside the container I mean)?\r\n\r\nThis is most likely a duplicate of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3791 , which is caused by an access pattern that a few special file systems don't support. So far we have seen it for VirtualBox shared folders, but there might be other ones."
