        "In playing around with `r.reconfigure` I entered the following query:\n\n``` reql\nr.db('test').table('bob').reconfigure(shards=1, replicas=0).run(conn)\n```\n\nAnd got the non-helpful error message:\n\n```\nrethinkdb.errors.RqlRuntimeError: Can't use server tag `default` for directors because you specified no replicas in server tag `default`. in:\nr.db('test').table('bob').reconfigure(shards=1, replicas=0)\n```\n\nSo there are three issues here:\n1. The word \"replicas\" is confusing because it is not obvious that the \"primary\" is counted as a replica.\n2. Given that the word \"replica\" is going to cause confusion, we should catch that case and tell the user in some clear manner that replicas can not be 0.\n3. We probably should have a 'bad query' error type rather than calling this a `RqlRuntimeError`.\n\n@Tryneus I was told that you might have thoughts on this.\n\nEdit: note that I am not confused by this, but am trying to look at this with fresh eyes.\n"
