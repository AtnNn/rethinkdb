      "@Saawant Two problems:\r\n1. You are making this comment in an issue that was closed months ago. It is also likely that your issue has nothing to do with the issue here.\r\n2. The most important line (the one preceding the traceback) is missing, so we don't know what happened. We also don't know:\r\n  - What version of the driver you are using\r\n  - What version of `rethinkdb` you are using\r\n  - How you are calling `restore` (it can matter in some cases), with what arguments.\r\n\r\nMy best advise to you would be to ask a question (not open an issue) on one of the forums listed on the [community page](https://rethinkdb.com/community/). The Slack channels are particularly active. That will help get you to what is going on much quicker, and if needed, help you write a better bug."
