      "Hum, so this is a little more tricky that it seems.\r\n\r\nRight now, I'm converting the results to a string with `JSON.stringify` -- I have to convert it with a string since I cannot do `$(.raw_view_textarea').html({})` for example.\r\n\r\nSo basically users have to copy/paste the results, and wrap them with a `JSON.parse`.\r\n\r\nI could implement a method to replace JSON.stringify and print a valid JavaScript variable I think. It doesn't seem super hard.\r\nHowever, it doesn't seem a good idea to me because it would mean that a Python user can't use the raw view to import things in his script.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @coffeemug?"
