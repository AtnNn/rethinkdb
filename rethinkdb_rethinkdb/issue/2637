        "while working with @nickpoorman. He has millions of documents in a table where each document is less then the 250 byte threshold if data should be stored in the index or not. Because his data is in the index with millions of documents, 8gb ram instances, 4gb default ram cache setting and about 10gb of data at the moment he cant keep his index in memory. So even a count on the table becomes super slow and when he has other read and write workloads running all demanding different parts of the index to be in memory its not a simple scan on the ssd.\r\n\r\nA suggestions is when creating a table to disable storing data in the primary index. this is useful for trying to keep index in memeory. and only then hitting disk for the exact records needed."
