      "I've been speaking with many people about this recently, and learned that people really want the notion of json diffs for feeds (because if a tiny part of the document changes, they don't want us to send the whole document, but just the diff).\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'd like to augment the proposal -- instead of `output=diff | full`, I propose we do `output=point | full` (basically, just rename `diff` to `point`). We can then add `diff` later that will do the *actual* diff.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think this should be required for 2.2, as without it `orderBy` feeds are basically unusable (my impression was that we agreed to include this with the other feed changes to significantly bump up usability)."
