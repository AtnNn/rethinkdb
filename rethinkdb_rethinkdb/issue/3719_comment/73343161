      "@marshall007 Can you explain a bit more what you mean by having to zip the arrays together? I'm not sure I understand what you mean.\r\nI imagined the idea was that you could just overwrite the whole data with a set of new values, which you would find in `new_val` when `include_all` is set.\r\n\r\nI think having the individual new/old value pairs is a little awkward because most of them will usually be the same with `include_all`.\r\nHaving two arrays `{old_val: [...], new_val: [...]}` looks a bit nicer to me."
