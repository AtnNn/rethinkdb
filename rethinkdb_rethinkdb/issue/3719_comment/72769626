      "I agree with @mlucy that it should be an optarg. But I think it should work for both changefeeds on streams and changefeeds on arrays. For example, if you do `r.table(...).map(...).reduce(...)` and the result is an array, you should be able to call `.changes(includes_all = False)` to have the server diff your arrays and send you changes in the same format as `r.table(...).changes()`."
