      "Option 2 as a sequence of arrays without an `old_val` sounds good.\r\n\r\nI don't like `feed_type`, and `format` (which I do like otherwise) has the mentioned conflict with the pseudo type format arguments. `output` would be ok, but I don't think it's perfect.\r\n\r\nWhat do you (and others) think about something more similar to the original `include_all` just without `include`? For example `resend_all`, `resend_full` or `send_full`?"
