      "`feed_format` is similar to `format`. I quite like it, but it also follows the same scheme as `binary_format`, `group_format` and `time_format`.\r\n\r\n@marshall007 That's actually an interesting way of looking at this. So the default would be omitting `unchanged`, and what we're discussing here would be equivalent to including those. I think it's a bit too complicated though, and the order in which `unchanged` \"changes\" arrive relative to the actual changes isn't quite obvious. Currently it looks like we'll be sending a complete array with all values as a single change, which I think is easier to understand and use."
