      "> In the `{old_val: [...], new_val: [...]}` case the arrays would never be sparse in any sense I can think of, would it?\r\n\r\nYea that's the syntax I was talking about. Imagine that the table is initially empty and I'm watching on `r.table(...).getAll(...).changes({ include_all: true })`. Once a document is inserted that matches the `getAll` wouldn't I get `{old_val: [ null ], new_val: [ { ... } ]}`? So `old_val` is sparse."
