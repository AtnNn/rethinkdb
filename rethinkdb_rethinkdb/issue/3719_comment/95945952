      "That wasn't my impression. I thought:\r\n\r\n- `diff`: works like it does now. Unchanged values don't show up at all (it's a diff!)\r\n- `full`: sends a stream of arrays, e.g. `[v1, v2, v3]` (we talked above about how including `old_val` at all would be completely superfluous with this option)."
