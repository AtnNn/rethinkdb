      "After thinking about this a bit more, it might be more consistent if the result were an array containing new/old value pairs i.e. `[ {new_val: ..., old_val: ...}, {new_val: ..., old_val: ...} ]`. That way you don't have to manually zip the two arrays together before passing them to your code that handles the existing changefeed behavior. I don't have strong opinions either way, though."
