      "> I still like the this format better because it avoids pairs of `old_val` and `new_val` that have the same value.\r\n\r\nAnd to address this part, like I said in my previous comment, if you don't care about diffing the values you should be using `.changes({ include_all: true })('new_val')` to avoid getting the extra data all together."
