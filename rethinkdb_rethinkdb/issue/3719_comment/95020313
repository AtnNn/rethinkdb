      "After reflecting on this:\r\n* I still like option 2 the best.\r\n* I now think the name `include_all` is terrible.  We've been using the `include_` prefix (for `include_states` and the `include_initial_vals` in CR) to mean \"add more information to the stream\", not \"change the format of the information in the stream\".  I can imagine users being confused about why `include_all` doesn't cause e.g. state documents to be included.\r\n  - I think we should instead have an optarg `format` which can be set to either `diff` or `set` (or possibly better names), with `diff` being the default and `set` being the format described in option 2."
