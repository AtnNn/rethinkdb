      "Apologies again for asking to reopen.\r\n\r\nI think that if the optarg can take on the values of `diff` and `set`, option 2 makes a lot more sense (heh, looks like it *is* all in the naming :smile:). I'd consider finding a better name for `set`, though. Maybe `full`? Also, `format` is a little confusing because we normally use that to control the representation of pseudotypes (also, see #2967). May be we should call the optarg `feed_type`?\r\n\r\nHowever, the format of option 2 still seems strange to me. What would be the point of returning the old values? Since the user can't correlate them with new values, they essentially can't do anything with that data -- we might as well just send an array of elements for each change, and drop the `old_val`/`new_val` fields altogether.\r\n"
