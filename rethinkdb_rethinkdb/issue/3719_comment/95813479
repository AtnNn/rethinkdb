      "Ok so to clarify/summarize if we go with the `feed_format=diff|full`\r\n\r\n- `diff`: implements @coffeemug's proposal. i.e. `[{old_val: ..., new_val: ...}, {old_val: ..., new_val: ...}, ...]` and unchanged values will only have `old_val` populated\r\n- `full`: implements option (2). i.e. `{old_val: [v1, v2, v3, ...], new_val: [v1', v2', v3', ...]}`. If a value is removed it will not appear in `new_val`, If it's added it will not appear in `old_val`\r\n\r\nMy only gripe with this is that in the proposed `diff` format it's still impossible to disambiguate between deleted and unchanged values. That seems like an important distinction for some use-cases. I don't see a good reason (aside from overhead) not to populate both `old_val` and `new_val` in the unchanged case."
