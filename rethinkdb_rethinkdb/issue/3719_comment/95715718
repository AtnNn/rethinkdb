      "* `full` instead of `set` sounds good to me.\r\n* I like `format` better than `feed_type`, but I don't really like either.  Maybe we can come up with a better one?  What do other people think?\r\n* I wouldn't be opposed to the variant of option 2 where we just return a stream of arrays; I think you're right that `old_val` is vestigal with that format."
