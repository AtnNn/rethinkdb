      "Planning to mark this as settled on Monday unless anyone objects, with the following interpretation:\r\n* We will add an optarg `include_all` to `changes` which will default to `false` for all currently-existing changefeeds.\r\n* Setting this optarg to `true` will error except on `.orderby.limit.changes` (in the future we may also support it for small ranges, or for `get_all`).  Setting this optarg to `true` will cause the server to re-send the entire ordered set every time something changes.\r\n* The format will be identical except that `new_val` and `old_val` will be arrays of documents rather than single documents.  We will add a `ResponseNote` (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3715) indicating that we're using a variant format."
