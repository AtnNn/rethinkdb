      "We decided against `c.table('asdf').run()` because it discourages re-using portions of queries.  (We want people to be able to write `tbl = r.db('foo').table('bar'); tbl.get(0).run(conn1); tbl.insert({id: 1}).run(conn2)`.)\r\n\r\nIt looks like what's being proposed originally is pretty similar to `r.connect(...).repl()` in Ruby, maybe we should just add that to JS?"
