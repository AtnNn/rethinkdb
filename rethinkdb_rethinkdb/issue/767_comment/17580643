      "I tried playing around with this a bit myself. The server seems to accept NaN when you simply reflect it back. If you try to do math on NaN we get a sensible error back. It's only when retrieving a row containing NaN that we fail a guarantee. We should handle NaN the same way on every code path.\r\n\r\nFYI, I can't actually replicate the crash. I get an ugly backtrace back in the data explorer but the server doesn't actually crash. I think this might be because I'm using the release build."
