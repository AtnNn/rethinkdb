      "I opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3802 for printing an additional message before we start deleting an incomplete data directory to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nI'm still not sure why RethinkDB couldn't access the pid-file directory.\r\n@linuxjuggler can you make sure that you can actually create directories in `/var/run`? E.g. `sudo mkdir -p /var/run/rethinkdb-test; rmdir /var/run/rethinkdb-test`.\r\n\r\nWe should also extend the error message to include the actual pid-file directory that RethinkDB tried to access and couldn't."
