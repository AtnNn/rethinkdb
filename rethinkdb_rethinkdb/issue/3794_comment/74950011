      "Thanks @linuxjuggler . \r\nDoes the directory `/var/run` exist on your system? Can you check if RethinkDB has created `/var/run/rethinkdb` and if yes, how the permissions on that are set?\r\n\r\n@Tryneus Ok, that makes sense. I didn't know we were cleaning up the directory if we had just created it and something went wrong.\r\nSo I guess the deletion here is expected and not a bug.\r\n\r\n"
