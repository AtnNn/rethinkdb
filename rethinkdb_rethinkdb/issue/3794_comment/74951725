      "@Tryneus I have few question : \r\n1- why the manual installation does not copy the binaries ( the build/release ) to some other place other than the same directory which I cloned from github ?\r\n2- why the instruction didnt say where to get the default files from ( I need to follow many links to get them).\r\n\r\nlast note I have is that `--without-tcmalloc` does not work when executing `./configure --without-tcmalloc --allow-fetch` so I think we need to update the instructions .."
