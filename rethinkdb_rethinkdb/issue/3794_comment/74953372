      "@linuxjuggler I guess the problem is that we don't have a `make install` at the moment as far as I know (or do we?). @AtnNn probably knows more about this.\r\nThe binary packages install these files in a location that's easier to find (`/etc/rethinkdb`), but that doesn't help of course if you build from source.\r\n\r\nI think we should add a final section on our \"Compile from source\" pages (like http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/raspbian/) that describes how to install the binary, init script and where to find the example configuration file. @AtnNn thoughts on that?\r\n\r\nThe `--without-tcmalloc` configure flag is now `--with-system-malloc`. Thanks for letting us know. I think @AtnNn is already working on updating the Raspberry Pi build instructions (we're waiting for getting a Raspberry to test it on)."
