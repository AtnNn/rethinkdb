      "@danielmewes, we delete the directory so users don't end up with a half-initialized directory.  There was some previous issue about this, but basically users would get a daemon that refused to start because it couldn't find the metadata files, even though the directory existed.  Users would have to manually remove the directory, and it was confusing, so we implemented this instead."
