      "@linuxjuggler Actually is it possible you had tried to start RethinkDB through the init script once before with a different `runuser` setting (or none at all)?\r\n\r\nI think if the `runuser` (e.g. `rethinkdb` by default) doesn't exist in the system, the init script might silently leave the pid file directory owned by `root`. So in that case the `rethinkdb` server wouldn't be able to write to it, even after changing `runuser` to the right value in the config file and restarting the rethinkdb server.\r\n\r\nThis would have been fixed by manually deleting the `/var/run/rethinkdb` directory. Some Linux distributions clear out that path on every restart, so @linuxjuggler if you had restarted the system in between, that would explain why it suddenly started working today."
