      "@AtnNn nothing special i just followed the instructions noted in the page without the flag which case an issue\r\nThen i just copied the config file and edit it to change the user/group as am too lazy to create them and also changed the path of the executable file in the startup scritp thats all\r\n\r\nPlus I ignored every warning I read on the screen. \r\nDidnt do a deep test just bind all to access the web admin interface. \r\n\r\nAm doing all this on rpi 1 I guess model b,  as am also waiting the new one to be delivered but it got some delay because of the weather. \r\n\r\nAny way am happy to help with anything I can"
