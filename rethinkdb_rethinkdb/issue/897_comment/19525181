      "@neumino I've used C++ wrapper around libprotobuf and dynamic message building/decomposing. I think I can safely remove Google Closure now, but driver will not work from browser, that's why I separated it from rethinkdb repository for now. As soon as I clean up my code I'll post it on GitHub."
