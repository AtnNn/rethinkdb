      "By the way, I really think that https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/887 is the wrong way to solve this. The reason is that https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/887 doesn't really solve this at all except for the very special case where the data to be inserted is already a JSON object.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should try to find faster protocol buffer libraries for the clients wherever possible.\r\n\r\nAlso, we should check that receiving data isn't equally affected by the inefficiencies."
