      "> I think that all drivers should be separated from main repository so that it's easier for people to contribute. \r\n\r\nThe one benefit of keeping the drivers in the main tree is that it's very easy to keep the drivers and the server in sync. We'll probably keep it this way for a while longer (while ReQL is still heavily evolving), and then split out the drivers soon.\r\n\r\n> Also I think that having separate drivers for Node.js and browser is the most appropriate option\r\n\r\nThat makes sense. It would be nice for them to have a shared codebase, though, to avoid duplication of work. This is our main concern about having two JS drivers.\r\n\r\n> what for the 4 byte offset in network code is used when sending and receiving data\r\n\r\nSorry, I'm not sure I understand -- could you be a little more specific?"
