      "@fuwaneko -- very cool, thanks!! We'll see what we can do wrt a faster protobuf library. We're exploring a couple of options:\r\n\r\n1. Use a different driver for node and for the web browser\r\n2. Maintain one driver, but have two different backends\r\n3. Write a single, efficient protobuf library that can be used in node and in browser\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, could you add your driver to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/wiki/Community-contributions?"
