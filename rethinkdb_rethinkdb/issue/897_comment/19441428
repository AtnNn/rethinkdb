      "Looks like for ruby, the ruby_protobuf gem is really old (last release 2 years ago). There's a newer gem - https://github.com/localshred/protobuf. It has a native c extension so it will be faster, but there might be a problem with running it on jruby, so you'd have to test that.\r\n\r\nOn another note, the code and code layout for the ruby driver is not very idiomatic."
