      "@coffeemug I think that all drivers should be separated from main repository so that it's easier for people to contribute. Currently you need to download whole repository and compilation is not very friendly if you want to work on driver only. Also I think that having separate drivers for Node.js and browser is the most appropriate option: for Node.js you would prefer maximum performance and Node.js-style code, for browser it's not really important to have extreme performance as no one will really use RethinkDB directly from browser, but as far as I understand it's used by RethinkDB admin UI.\r\n\r\nBy the way, what for the 4 byte offset in network code is used when sending and receiving data?"
