      "All right, I changed rethinkdb JS driver code to my taste. Back then I could get ~ 20 requests per second on my simple test environment. Now I can get ~ 200 and I think there are still some optimizations left (and my test environment is really tacky, if I had SSD drive I could easily get much more, because my app is disk I/O heavy), but profiling shows that it's clearly will not add up more than few queries as serialization does not even show up in call tree as something time-consuming.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about all that Google Closure parts, could I remove them completely, or they are used somewhere. Anyways next step is to test it in our real environment. If you're interested in my patches \8212 just let me know, I plan to put everything on my GitHub tomorrow."
