      "@lincolnq -- what client are you using?\r\n\r\nWe've encountered consistently slow protobuf serialization in most of the client libraries we use.  I don't think we'll have a good way to solve this in general until we get to #887.\r\n\r\nSorry about our poor performance on your workload!  As @coffeemug says, we'll try to get this fixed (or at least provide a workaround) soon."
