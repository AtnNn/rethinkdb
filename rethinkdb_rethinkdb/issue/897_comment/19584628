      "Ok, 1.7 will include a number of performance improvements that will address insert performance. I'm closing this issue in favor of more descriptive ones in 1.7. Here they are:\r\n\r\n* #1025, #1026, #1027 -- moving the drivers over to faster protobuf libs\r\n* #887 -- supporting `r.json` that will allow shipping json objects in plaintext (to avoid parsing it on the client, and serializing it into protobufs)\r\n* #520 -- we flush to disk more than we need to\r\n* #939 -- for large objects, we write more than we need to\r\n\r\nPlease track performance issues there. Thanks everyone for your help with debugging everything!"
