      "@grk -- thanks, we'll look into protobuf.\r\n\r\nWould you be able to take the time and list specific things that aren't idiomatic in the Ruby driver? We'd *love* to fix them. The Ruby driver was @mlucy's first Ruby program, which is why we have non-idiomatic code. If you could take the time, we'd be immensely grateful."
