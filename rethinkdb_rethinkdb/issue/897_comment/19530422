      "> keep the drivers and the server in sync\r\n\r\nYes, this is important.\r\n\r\n> to avoid duplication of work\r\n\r\nI think that it's still important to remove Google closure. It's possible to implement serialization/parsing in JS the same way I did with C++ addon (i.e. no pre-generated code), then we can just include different modules on Node.js and in browser environment and the main codebase will remain same. I think about Grunt compilation targets that will produce rethink.js and rethink-web.js :) Thus it's not required to separate driver to two different parts internally.\r\n\r\n> more specific\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/src/net.coffee#L59\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/src/net.coffee#L62\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/src/net.coffee#L68\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/src/net.coffee#L204"
