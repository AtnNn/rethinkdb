      "Ok, considering the huge number of people who run into insert performance issues, I change my mind: We should implement https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/887 asap and make the inefficient drivers use it transparently in the background.\r\n\r\nThat will buy us time to look into more optimized protobuf implementations, which we will still definitely need when we start supporting additional non-json data types."
