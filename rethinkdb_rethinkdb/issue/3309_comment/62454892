      "Hi @t3hmrman, sorry you had to run into this.\r\n\r\nIn the next version of RethinkDB, we are going to compile the web assets into the binary, so this should go away (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1093),\r\n\r\nUntil then, another work around is to specify the `--web-static-directory` command line option:\r\n`rethinkdb --web-static-directory ~/path/to/rethinkdb/build/release/web_assets`"
