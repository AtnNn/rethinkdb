      "FYI, the version of npm on travis is `1.2.14`. The version on newton is `1.2.21`. The version of node on travis is `v0.8.22`, the version of node on newton is `v0.10.7`.\r\n\r\nMight this have something to do with it? (We can just upgrade node/npm as part of the travis script and see if things still fail -- we should probably make these version checks part of the configure script)."
