      "The TcpConnection object inherits the 'once' method from its parent the Connection object. This is part of the event emitter interface recently added to the Connection object in the JS driver.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen this issue before nor is it immediately clear why this is happening. The method is appropriately defined in the source from what I can see. All the polyglot tests passed before I pushed this code.\r\n\r\n@atnnn presumably you saw this on a recent commit to next. Do you have a link to the travis output?"
