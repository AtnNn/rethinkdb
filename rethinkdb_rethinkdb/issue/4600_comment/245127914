      "@pdonorio I don't think the version check is the issue. The version check runs in the background and will not block a RethinkDB server from starting up (you can start with `--no-version-check` to verify this). The `getaddrinfo` that's blocking is one that's related to figuring out the interfaces to bind on I think."
