      "This also comes up when offline, as I discovered during a power outage. My laptop still runs, but WiFi is down, so my rethink docker container went from 2s startup to 24s startup. Fun to debug with access to the Internet only through a 3g tablet. But I did manage to come to the same conclusion as this issue through code inspection on github before landing here!"
