      "I can confirm that with wifi disabled and `rethinkdb --no-update-check` the issue is still there.\r\n\r\nNow that I recall, I had a similar app hanging with `socket.gethostbyaddr` in python, of course when offline. Since there were no options to use a shorter timeout it ended up with skipping the call when you know you are disconnected.\r\n"
