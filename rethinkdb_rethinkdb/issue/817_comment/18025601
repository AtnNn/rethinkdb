      "Ok, this is reproducible with a cluster of only one machine and an unsharded table.  I can't reproduce this without active write traffic going to the table (reads and deletes not necessary), but that may just be luck, it's not consistently reproducible.  It doesn't seem to matter whether or not the field exists in rows."
