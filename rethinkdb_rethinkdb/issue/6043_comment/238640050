      "I can confirm that that logic is the problem, and that the same problem occurs if use `easy_install` rather than `pip` (the only normal way of getting true `egg`s). I have a possible solution to this that I am testing now.\r\n\r\nAnd it does not seem that in your setup that you will run into it, but FYI: there is logic in `setup.py` that will only include the `asyncio` file on versions of Python that support it. So you need to do your packaging with a version of Python that supports it (by default 3.4+)."
