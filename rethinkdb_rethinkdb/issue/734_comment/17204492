      "Hmm. We should consider rewriting integration tests to use YCSB. This way they'd a) use ReQL instead of the deprecated memcached interface, b) use a real driver and exercise the full stack, c) will use the same piece of software as the performance tests. I realize it's effort, but I think it would be well spent."
