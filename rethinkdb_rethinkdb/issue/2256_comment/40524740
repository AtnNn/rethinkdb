      "Hi @wojons,\r\nsorry this happened. This is very likely because we don't throttle backfills to limit the total amount of used memory in 1.12.2 and earlier. The problem was fixed as part of #2211 and will be released with the next point release.\r\n\r\n@wojons Is it possible to bump up the memory on that node for now?"
