      "@larkost all the failures with `row error passed through outer promise rather than final function` are not valid. `eachAsync` will always return a promise and `.catch(...)` is now the preferred way to handle exceptions. The (optional) finish callback is only there for callback-style people who aren't looking at the promise returned from `eachAsync` and should be called **in addition to** the promise being rejected."
