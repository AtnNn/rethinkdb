      "Thanks for the explanations @marshall007 .\r\n\r\nThis project is getting a bit out of hand.\r\nTo be honest I think in reality nobody is going to care about these edge cases of `eachAsync`, and we have enough other important things to take care of.\r\n\r\nAs a third option: How about we simply return `undefined` from `eachAsync` if the `final` callback is specified?\r\n\r\nIt would enforce the usage of *either* the promise-style or callback style final/error handler. It would completely avoid any ambiguity about whether promises returned from the `final` callback should be handled, or whether an error passed into the `final` callback should also be passed to the returned promise.\r\n\r\nIn that case, I also think that we should entirely ignore the return value of the `final` callback.\r\n\r\nWould there be anything wrong with that API?"
