      "@larkost That was a misunderstanding then. If we don't return anything from `eachAsync` when it has a `final` callback, there is nothing we could do with those promises.\r\nPeople can't run into bad surprises as far as I can tell, because it makes no difference whether we resolve the promise or not. We will return `undefined` in either case."
