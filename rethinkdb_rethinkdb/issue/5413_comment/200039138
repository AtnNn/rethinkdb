      "As I understand it the plan is still to accept `Promise` returns, for consistency with the `row` handler. Even if we don't, we should still warn people if we don't accept them, as otherwise people will run into bad surprises when their code in production does not work like it happened to in development because we are not actually following returned `Promise`s."
