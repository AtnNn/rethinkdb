      "Just clarifying this: while @nighelles and I were working on a new test he was creating within `cursor.mocha` I got worried that other existing tests were not `return`ing the promises that they were using, and so failures within those test could well go unmarked. This bug is to audit that to make sure we are doing the right thing."
