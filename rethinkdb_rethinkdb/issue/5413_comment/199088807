      "> This project is getting a bit out of hand.\r\n> To be honest I think in reality nobody is going to care about these edge cases of eachAsync, and we have enough other important things to take care of.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify: this didn't go against you @marshall007 , and I really appreciate your input on this.
