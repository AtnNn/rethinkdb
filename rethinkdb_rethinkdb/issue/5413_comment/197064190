      "@larkost I don't think [`cursor.mocha#L542-L560`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/331da0f8b37fcabbde9b86f8cbd249250fbf823e/test/rql_test/connections/cursor.mocha#L542-L560) is a valid test. Enforcing this behavior would require you to `return Promise.resolve()` as a no-op when you want to skip over a row, for example."
