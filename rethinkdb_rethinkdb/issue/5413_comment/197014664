      "I have an initial version of this pushed to branch `larkost/5413-javascript-connection-tests`. That winds up doing a lot more than this initially started out as it adds extensive testing for the new behavior for `eachAsync`, as well as as preliminary testing for #5478 (has not been checked with that code yet).\r\n\r\nThis does wind up turning up a trio of repeated problems that @nighelles is working on."
