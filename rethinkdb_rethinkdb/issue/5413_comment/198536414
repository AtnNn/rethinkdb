      "The only exception to that would be if we have an error within the `final` handler. Then we have no other option (that the user could theoretically catch) than to put it out out the Promise chain as an error/rejection. I would rather do that then either drop it, or just call an uncatchable assertion. It will produce slightly more complicated errors, but give the user a method of catching them."
