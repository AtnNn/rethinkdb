        "Hey! I feel that Mike Mintz' approach \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WchhRxdNojk\n\nIs in someways superior to `hz`. It's simple and validation makes much more sense to us. For example, if I need to make an API call to validate an incoming request, no problem. With `hz` it seems a bit more convoluted. I dare say that  RethinkDB-Websocket-Client is better than Meteor's `minimongo` and for our timeline needs, even preferred to GraphQL. I'm sure many would adopt it if they knew about it.\n\nAnyway, the point for us is that we'd like to use RethinkDB in a project with React Native. Also, this is basically a monkey-patch job, which is super cool for what Mike was able to do, but it seems you guys can make it official.\n# FeatureRequest\n"
