      "We were experiencing the same issue after moving to v2, and in our case the issue was linked to merges (joining data from another table) and not calling 'coerceTo(array)' after a 'getAll' request. Generally, we've needed to be more deliberate with places where previous versions of Rethink would handle cursors/arrays interchangeably, now using a lot more 'coerceTo' calls."
