      "@danielmewes We were running RethinkDB v1.16.3 and `npm/rethinkdb@1.16.2`. We upgraded to RethinkDB v2.0.4 and `npm/rethinkdb@2.0.2`.\r\n\r\nSide note, is there a reason that [`npm/rethinkdb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rethinkdb) is not always consistent with the [RethinkDB release](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/releases) version numbers?"
