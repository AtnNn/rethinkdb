      "Slava's comment implies that this API won't be public for a while. But here's a way to simplify it: Remove the word `reactor_` from every function name. Remove `reactor_create()` and `reactor_destroy()`; instead, automatically create the reactor when the blueprint says that the node has a role, and destroy it when it no longer has a role. Finally, since we are no longer specifying the filename as a parameter to `reactor_create()`, add a `set_filename()` function to specify where the data file should go. Probably it would be mandatory to call `set_filename()` before `set_blueprint()`."
