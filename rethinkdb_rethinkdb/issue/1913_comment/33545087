      ":+1: :+1: :+1:\r\n\r\nI want to be able to integrate rethinkdb to my system really well. This could be a killer feature. The sad thing is that the rethinkdb team will have to spend time to manage issues created from poor cluster management plugins. The cluster API will be another thing to manage as well. RethinkDB may also get bad press when people screw up because they have been given too much power and can't use it properly. Hopefully a good balance can be reached so the pros outweigh the cons dramatically."
