      "If I'm not mistaken, by default, you'll get the notification and the behavior is the following one:\r\n- If you close it, you won't be notified again for *this version*. This is done with the `ignore_version` variable stored in localStorage -- https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/admin/static/coffee/body.coffee#L169\r\n- If you click on the gear icon, you can deactivate the notification for the updates for any upcoming versions, which is done with `check_updates` here: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/admin/static/coffee/body.coffee#L218\r\n\r\nToggling the default is just about changing a `if`, so it should be pretty easy."
