      "Thanks @rbucker881! The libyaml/pyyaml oversight has been fixed in the latest brew package (but the pull request hasn't been accepted by brew people yet -- it should be shortly).\r\n\r\nAs for pyyaml and coffee warnings -- that's ok, you can just safely ignore. Pinging @atnnn (our brew expert) if he could comment on the warnings and whether we can do something about them."
