        "It would be nice to have an official pronunciation for \"ReQL\", and hopefully head off a repeat of the sort of divergence of use that we see with \"SQL\".\r\n\r\nIf I may offer my suggestion, I would vote for pronouncing it like the word RECALL, for several reasons.\r\n\r\n1.  \"Recall\" is a real English word, so it is easy to say and doesn't sound awkward.\r\n2.  \"Requel\" (which people might guess based on SQL as \"sequel\") on the other hand sounds like a made-up word to describe the worst movies of the Star Wars saga.  (Okay, so it's a clever neologism, but who wants to be associated with Jar-Jar Binks?)\r\n3.  \"Recall\" also has the benefit of being relevant to the purposes of a database, and of ReQL's role in using a database.\r\n4.  Although \"rethink\" in RethinkDB seems to primarily evoke the idea of rethinking how databases should be designed to work, it also evokes to a lesser extent the idea of remembering (thinking again), which ties in nicely to \"recall\".\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps you (or others) are already pronouncing it as \"requel\", but since this is still fairly early in RethinkDB's life (which I hope is a very long and prosperous life!) it's certainly not too late to decide the \"recall\" would be a better and cleverer and more memorable way to pronounce it.  And since (as far as I know) no official statement has been made about the pronunciation, it's definitely not too late to make one saying it should be pronounced \"recall\".  :smiley:\r\n"
