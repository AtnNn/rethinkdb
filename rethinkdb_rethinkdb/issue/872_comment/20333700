      "My two cents: these names (`literal`, `lit`, `val`) seem oddly specific to\r\nme, and while accurate, aren't connecting with me. Not knowing the\r\ninternals of the system, is there a reason we can't use `r.json` to say,\r\n\"here's this chunk of JSON I want to merge this document with-- treat is\r\njust as JSON\"?\r\n\r\nI'd prefer `doc` out of all those mentioned. But I'll be comfortable with\r\nwhatever's ultimately chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Jul 2, 2013 at 1:35 AM, Michael Lucy <notifications@github.com>wrote:\r\n\r\n> Also, we should decide between r.lit and r.literal.\r\n>\r\n> \8212\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub<https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/872#issuecomment-20333322>\r\n> .\r\n>"
