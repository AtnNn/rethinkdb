      "> I really like the idea of dropping the optional argument to merge, making it deep by default, and introducing `r.val` to man \"literally this\". I don't think we should have `r.lav` or equivalents.\r\n\r\nI agree and like this.\r\n\r\n> What should we call it?\r\n\r\nI really don't like `r.val` or `r.literal`. I prefer `r.shallow`, but if we want a more general name that we can eventually use elsewhere I think we should call it `r.document` or `r.doc`. I think I strongly prefer `r.doc` to alternatives discussed so far.\r\n\r\n> Should we use `r.literal()` to mean \"erase this field\"?\r\n\r\nI really like the idea of `r.doc()` meaning erase the field."
