      "Hmm, I guess that wouldn't work. I think this is a sign that our data model in the query language is completely messed up. Using pseudo types is a really bad hack here. It plays really badly with functions because functions can't be stored in objects which quickly became an issue in `order_by`. Can you think of any way of doing this in our current system that doesn't suck?"
