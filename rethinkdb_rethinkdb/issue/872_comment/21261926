      "We should be careful about using pseudo types to implement various features. I really think it would be weird if driver developers had to actually construct objects to send a literal and would make the concept of a pseudo type really hard for them to understand. I suppose we could add a constructor but it would still be confusing for users if they stored them in values or just evaluated them outside of `merge`. I think we basically shouldn't use pseudo types unless they're actual values we might want returned to the user."
