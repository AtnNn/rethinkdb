      "From my (limited front-end) perspective, a \"doc\" is a chunk of data that\r\ncan be simply represented as JSON-- one doc can include another doc, but\r\nit's only equivalent to a row in SQL if it's the top-level (parent)\r\ndocument in a table. This doesn't seem like a serious dilution of the\r\nconcept.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Jul 2, 2013 at 11:24 AM, coffeemug <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> I don't like the idea of shortcutting any word (i.e. I prefer literal to\r\n> lit, document to doc, etc.)\r\n>\r\n> If it's a choice between r.literal, r.value, and r.document, I'd prefer\r\n> r.literal, but I don't think any of these are particularly good.\r\n> Actually, r.json would be really nice if we could make it work, but I\r\n> don't think we can.\r\n>\r\n> I'm going to break out my copy of Roget's tonight and will post some\r\n> alternatives.
