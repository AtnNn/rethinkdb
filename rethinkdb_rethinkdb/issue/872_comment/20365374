      "I don't like the idea of shortcutting any word (i.e. I prefer `literal` to `lit`, `document` to `doc`, etc.)\r\n\r\nIf it's a choice between `r.literal`, `r.value`, and `r.document`, I'd prefer `r.literal`, but I don't think any of these are particularly good. Actually, `r.json` would be really nice if we could make it work, but I don't think we can.\r\n\r\nI'm going to break out my copy of Roget's tonight and will post some alternatives. There should be a few lurking in there. If there aren't and nobody has ideas, we can just go with `r.literal` since it's the one that everyone likes the most out of our existing choices."
