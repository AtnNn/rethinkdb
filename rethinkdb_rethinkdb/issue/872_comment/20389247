      "I like `exact` less than `literal` from a meaning perspective.  We aren't saying \"use EXACTLY this value, and not a similar but nearby value\" (e.g. \"be here at exactly 6\", or \"measure out exactly 6 teaspoons\"), we're saying \"use this value LITERALLY rather than interpreting it as a representation of something else\" (e.g. \"use a literal string here\" or \"he had a literal gremlin on his shoulder\")."
