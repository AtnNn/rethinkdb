      "I think `r.doc` seems really weird in the context we're using this. Saying:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.expr({\"foo\" : \"bar\", \"fizz\" : {\"buzz\" : 1}}).merge({\"fizz\" : r.doc({})})\r\n```\r\nJust doesn't really seem to fit with what my concept of what a document is. I don't think that saying \"the \"fizz\" subfield is a document\" has any meaning to anyone. I certainly don't think it suggests: \"If I merge this dict then because the \"fizz\" subfield is a document it will not recurse in to it. But will just replace the other object.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore when you say:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.expr({\"foo\" : \"bar\", \"fizz\" : {\"buzz\" : 1}}).merge({\"fizz\" : r.shallow({})})\r\n```\r\n\r\n`r.shallow` is an adjective which describes how you merge. When you attach it to a part of the data you're merging it makes it seem like an adjective which describes the data. And describing a piece of data as shallow doesn't have a meaning to me which suggests this behavior."
