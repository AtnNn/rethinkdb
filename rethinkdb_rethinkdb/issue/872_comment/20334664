      "After asking @mlucy to explain to me the behavior we're discussing, I now\r\nunderstand the motivation.\r\n\r\nI would significantly prefer `r.doc`, since `val` and `literal` are too\r\nabstract and general (but make sense from a programming language designer's\r\nview).\r\n\r\nWhen this command is being used,you want to merge in a literal document --\r\nthe noun being `doc`, and the adjective being 'literal'. I would far prefer\r\nto use the noun-- or `r.doc`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Jul 2, 2013 at 1:46 AM, Mike Glukhovsky <mglukhovsky@gmail.com>wrote:\r\n\r\n> Sorry, upon review of the proposal, it appears I misunderstood the use of\r\n> `val` / `literal` (trying to recreate the chain of the discussion over the\r\n> past 30+ comments).
