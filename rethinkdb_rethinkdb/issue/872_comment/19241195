      "If we called merge `update` then `r.table(...).get(...).merge(...)` wouldn't work any more (it would instead be a write query).  In general I think using the same name for a JSON transformation and a write query is likely to lead to confusion, especially since the distinction between a bare object and a single row selection might be a little fuzzy in users' minds.  I feel less strongly about `r.replace`, but I still don't like it much.\r\n\r\nHow about `r.literal` instead of `r.val`?\r\n\r\nI think that `r.erase` might be a really good idea.  Currently if you want to remove a field from your table you have to do `replace` + `without`, which feels clunky.  With `r.erase` you could just do an update."
