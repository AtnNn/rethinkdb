      "I really like the proposal of `r.val` but I hate the name. I actually think `replace` would be a better name for it. It behaves analogously to the mutation operation replace and I think them having the same name helps decrease the mental overhead of the operations and reinforce the connection. Also in that same vein maybe we should do away with the name `merge` and call it `update`. I'm not sure about these though. It seems like it might be too cute."
