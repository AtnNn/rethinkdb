      "A few thoughts:\r\n\r\n* Upon some further thinking, I also *really* like the `r.val` syntax (I originally thought it to be odd), but I *really* hate the name. (I don't like the name `replace` for it). May be `r.shallow`?\r\n* I don't think we need `r.lav`/`r.erase` or its equivalent for now (I'm in favor of doing less work here and hoping we'll discover we don't have to ever do it) . You can always call `without` after the merge (btw, we'll also need to extend the pluck proposal to that).\r\n"
