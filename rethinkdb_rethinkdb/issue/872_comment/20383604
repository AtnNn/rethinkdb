      "@coffeemug I actually got `r.exact` looking in a thesaurus for synonyms for literal. I actually think I like it better than literal and it's shorter. Another option that looked okay to me was `r.plain` but I don't like that quite as much.\r\n\r\nClearly the funniest option is `r.bona_fide`."
