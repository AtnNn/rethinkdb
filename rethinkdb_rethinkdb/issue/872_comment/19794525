      "I would like to extend discussion on this by a day.  I really like the idea of dropping the optional argument to merge, making it deep by default, and introducing `r.val` to man \"literally this\".  I don't think we should have `r.lav` or equivalents.\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n* What should we call it?  `r.val`, `r.shallow`, `r.literal`, or something else?  I'm leaning toward `r.literal`.\r\n* Should we use `r.literal()` to mean \"erase this field\"?  I sort of like this, since it lets you do something that used to require `replace`/`without` in an `update`, and \"literally nothing\" makes semantic sense to me.  I would be less happy with this if we used `r.val` or `r.shallow`.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug, @jdoliner -- what do you think?"
