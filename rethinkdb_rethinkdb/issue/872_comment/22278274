      "Umm this is kind of administrative at this point. I'm about to merge it in to the dates branch. And whenever that makes it in to next this will be available. I think the simplest thing is to just have the rule that the issue tracker always reflects next. And I'll just remember to close this issue whenever @mlucy merges in dates.\r\n\r\n Also the API is of course documented things don't pass code review without docs."
