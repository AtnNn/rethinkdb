      "I kind of feel the same with @mglukhovsky.\r\n\r\nWhile `r.literal` totally makes sense, I'm pretty sure that __a lot__ of web developers have no idea what it is.\r\n\r\n`r.value` would connect with more people (I believe `value` sounds like a primitive as oppose to a pointer) I think, but the difference between `r.expr` and `r.value` doesn't look obvious.\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong preference, but I think I slightly prefer `r.literal`"
