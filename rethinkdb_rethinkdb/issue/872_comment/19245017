      "Here's what I mean: when you say `obj.merge({\"foo\" : r.val({\"fizz\" : \"buzz\"})})` `val` basically serves to say: \"take this literal object I've given you (`{\"fizz\" : \"buzz\"}`) and stick it right there, don't do any of this merging business.\"\r\n\r\nNow if you say `obj.merge({\"foo\" : r.val()})` you'll be saying: \"taking this literally object I've given you (which in this case is nothing) and stick it right there. Which is to say set `obj[\"foo\"]` to nothing.\""
