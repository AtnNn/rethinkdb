      "@gotlium Regarding some queries not showing up in the reads graph of the web UI: This is a known oversight that will be fixed in the next release (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2379).\r\n\r\nIt's theoretically possible that RethinkDB is slower on OS X in these queries than on Linux (which I was using). I don't have access to a Mac at the moment, but can check it next week.\r\n\r\nRegarding performance in general (@v3ss0n @gotlium): I'm currently preparing a few small benchmark scripts based on @gotlium description that I will put here for download and discussion."
