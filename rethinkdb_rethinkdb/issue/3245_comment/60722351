      "> quackery\r\n\r\nNo i am not proving Mysql and RethinkDB performance is almost equal , i know something is off with my set up i have said that ,  ***Something is off*** .\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to say is , with RethinkDB IO seems to be the problem , because without using full power of CPU like you have(about 400-500%) for my case it only use 40-50% ( about only 10% on each core) . That main is due to IO Waiting (32% most of the time ) .\r\n\r\nI didn't have a chance to reoptimize mysql for my laptop yet,i use this laptop for App development in MongoDB  and Redis , I haven't use MySQL for so long (stopped using it since before switch to Innodb) so i have to research innodb tuning a bit again. I only care about RethinkDB performance right now ."
