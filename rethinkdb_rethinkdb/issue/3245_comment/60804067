      "@danielmewes , yes on first cases cache enabled, and on second test is disabled. But on rethinkdb cache is enabled too. I think on RethinkDB need to optimize IO and CPU usage + query cache with pagination. I loved RethinkDB and I really want to use it. I open this issue only for this case. Thanks for you to. I'll be waiting version 2.0. I hope you will optimize problems and transcend mongo with mysql. Thanks for all:)"
