      "@gotlium Another thing that just came to my mind: By default RethinkDB uses some fraction of the free RAM for its cache. However the way it obtains the free RAM doesn't always work well (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3193 ). I recommend you start RethinkDB with an explicit cache size, e.g. `--cache-size 2048` for a 2 GB cache.\r\nNot sure if that is actually part of the problem here."
