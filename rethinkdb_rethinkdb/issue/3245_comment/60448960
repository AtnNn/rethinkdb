      "(Also, to say more about `skip`, I think we might want to discourage people from using it.  The main thing people try to do with it is pagination, which is why they're upset that it's slow, but `skip` isn't very good for pagination because you might get duplicate results if there are inserts in-between the two queries.  It's better to use cursors for pagination, which will prevent duplicates in addition to being efficient.)"
