      "@gotlium: I think you misunderstand what the MySQL Query Cache does. It is not really a data cache, but rather caches the complete results for a given query (actually for the text of a query). You can think about it as a memorized response. The first instance of any given query (text) the database does all of the work, and caches the response it generates. If it sees that same query text a second time it just spits out the cache response. This is not really useful in database measurements.\r\n\r\nIf you want a better query put something involving time in the query. A good solution would be to put `now()` into the result on both servers. Queries involving time bypass the MySQL Query Cache, and you would be asking both serves for the same work."
