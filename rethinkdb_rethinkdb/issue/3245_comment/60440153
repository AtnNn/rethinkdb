      "Hi @gotlium , thank you for sharing your test results with us.\r\n\r\nI think there are a few different things going on here:\r\n* skip/limit: This is indeed not optimized with RethinkDB at the moment. One of the open issues about this is https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2241\r\n* Simple select: Did you create an index on `slug` in MySQL? If yes, note that MySQL automatically uses indexes, while in RethinkDB you have to use the `getAll()` term instead of `filter()` to make use of an index.\r\n* Insert: These numbers indeed seem *very* slow. Were you inserting single documents one at a time? We have an article http://rethinkdb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#my-insert-queries-are-slow.-how-can-i-speed-t with some tips on how to speed inserts up with RethinkDB.\r\n  Your numbers average to 49 inserts/s. You should be able to get a couple of 1,000 probably."
