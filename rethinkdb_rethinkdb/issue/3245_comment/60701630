      "Regarding insert performance: It turns out that the bottleneck with my script (at least) on SSDs is that it only uses a single client.\r\n\r\nIf I run multiple clients concurrently, I'm getting more than 4x the insert throughput with RethinkDB (I only tried up to 5 concurrent clients). It appears that the bottleneck is either the client (MySQL uses a compiled C driver with PHP, RethinkDB doesn't), or it could be a per-connection bottleneck on the server. In any case you will see much higher write throughputs in production if you use concurrent clients.\r\n\r\nRegarding slow transfer of results I opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3249\r\n\r\nClosing because the identified issues are now tracked elsewhere."
