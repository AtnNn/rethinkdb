      "Hi, @danielmewes , thanks for you too.\r\n* skip/limit: maybe, but tests is tests. now on internet nosql is touted as a high-performance system, but on real is bullshit.\r\n* Simple select: yes, I create the index. With ``filter`` executed in  4.92s. 0,5 sec different. With ``getAll`` executed in 100ms. But MySQL is for x40 faster.\r\n* Insert: I insert by one row a 2 million records and result is 3 hour +. Bulk insert+indexing is a 20 minutes. When I insert more then 100.000 records, I'm getting socket error. When I insert 50.000 records - all is working fine. I'm using Python app.\r\n\r\nThanks for your response. Any ideas else?"
