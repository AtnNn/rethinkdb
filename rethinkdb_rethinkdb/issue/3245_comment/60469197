      "Another interesting thing:\r\n\r\n`r.table(\"table\").getAll('a2874dd56b20b8277a6606520c75fef1', {index: \"slug\"}).coerceTo(\"ARRAY\")` runs in approximately 1.5 ms server time on my machine. The result has 150 documents.\r\n\r\nHowever if I run the same query with a client and measure the time it takes to actually transfer the result I'm getting runtimes in the range of 25 ms.\r\nIt seems the majority of the time is taken for transferring the result to the client."
