      "To say more about indexes, the big advantage of making them explicit is that when you see a query you always know whether or not it's efficient.  A `get_all(X, index:'foo')` will either be efficient or return an error.  This makes it a lot easier to look for performance problems in your code.  (Also, for some cases like compound indexes it can actually be difficult to reason out whether or not a particular query is able to make use of an index in SQL.)"
