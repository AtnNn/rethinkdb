      "@gotlium  Yes , i will try with PyPy after this is done . PyPy is quite fast , almost close to V8 performance. And then rewrite in Go , ( i only tested GO in \"hello world\" :) )\r\n\r\nDuring this performance bench , the problem I see is IOWait. CPU Usage is 10% at max (I am right now at Read performance test ) . It is hitting IOWait and %iowait is at 37 and Load is 21! \r\n\r\nI think there is driver issue in python. If Interpreter issue , it will max out cpu usage.\r\nTesting on 4th gen Core i7 , Quadcore , 16 GB Ram ."
