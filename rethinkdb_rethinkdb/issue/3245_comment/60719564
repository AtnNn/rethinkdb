      "@v3ss0n, your my.cnf is not working, because you memory < 16GB, optimize innoDB settings, and re-check. when mysql settings is optimized, it will be really faster. So now you're benchmarks is meaningless. All my thoughts is above, when I wrote about drivers and db/os optimization. You need reproduce with recommendation, and understand why are you doing that. What are you doing now it is quackery."
