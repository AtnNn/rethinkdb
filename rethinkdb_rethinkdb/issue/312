        "I just got a new computer, so while having a fresh install of Archlinux, I tried to build RethinkDB.\n\nThere are 3 littles things that need to be changed in order to build RethinkDB.\nThe libprotoc and libprotobuf have different paths. Here are the two symbolic links I had to create in order to build.\n\n```\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/libprotobuf.so /usr/lib/libprotobuf.a\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/libprotoc.so /usr/lib/libprotoc.a\n```\n\nThe last thing concerns python. Archlinux use python 3 as the default python. So the command python refers to python 3.\n\nReplacing all references of python by python2 worked for me.\n\n<pre>\nfind ./ -type f -exec sed -i '1 s/python$/python2/' {} +\n</pre>\n\n(That's also what they are doing in the PKGBUILD for the moment)\n\nI don't know how tricky it is to fix these things in our build process, but since we are going to change it, if the person doing it can keep in mind these 2 things it would be cool.\n\nObviously tagging in backlog.\n"
