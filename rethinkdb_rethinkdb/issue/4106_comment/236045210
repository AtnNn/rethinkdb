      "I would add that the error message 'cannot call changes on an eager stream' is always very opaque, the documentation for changes() doesn't give any hints about it. \r\n\r\nAs a user, I'm left mostly to trial and error to figure out what changes() will work with. \r\n\r\nIdeally something like: \r\n' cannot call changes on `<type>` resulting from `<op>`  '\r\n\r\nwould be a lot more informative\r\n\r\n\r\n"
