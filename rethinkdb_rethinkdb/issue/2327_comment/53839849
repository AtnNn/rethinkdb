      "Not so fast with the closing.\r\n\r\nRiak has a feature called \"rabbit\" which you can enable in the config file, which does exactly what this bug is asking for.\r\n\r\nSome OSes (RHEL/Centos/Amazon Linux) don't auto-restart services which have failed.  In fact, to do so is very non-standard, very custom in a Linux/UNIX environment.\r\n\r\nMySQL even does this.  The mysqld_safe process monitors the mysqld process, and if mysqld dies, mysqld_safe restarts it automatically.\r\n\r\nRethinkdb should have this feature.  If you want to be taken seriously, you have to have these types of enterprise-level features.\r\n\r\nThe idea of trading availability for ANYTHING is a mistake.  Availability is what everyone wants in a production environment."
