      "systemd offers a configuration option just for that purpose ('Restart=' and 'RestartSec=' to specify a delay).\r\nSo we would get this functionality for free on systemd based distributions with https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2014.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, upstart has a `respawn` (and `respawn limit`) option to perform the same thing, which users can take advantage of once we implement https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2037 .\r\n\r\nI'm going to open an issue in our docs repository, so we can document how to configure auto restart once #2014 and #2037 are in."
