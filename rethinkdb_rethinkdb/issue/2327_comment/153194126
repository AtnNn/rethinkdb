      "@danielmewes As it turned out, we had a cron running that was doing regular backups. The backup would start; the server would run out of disk space; and then both `rethinkdb dump` as well as the rethinkdb server would fail. So, it was hard to find any actual evidence of what was occurring, since (as far as I know) a failed dump will clean up after itself.\r\n\r\nOn that note, perhaps it might be useful for `rethinkdb dump` to issue a disk space warning if it seems like it's going to go over a particular limit?\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your speedy response and attention to this issue."
