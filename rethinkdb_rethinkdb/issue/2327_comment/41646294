      "Well, it shouldn't crash :-)\r\n\r\n1.12 should use less memory, so you have less chance to see this problem.\r\nDo you run RethinkDB on a VPS? Something like Digital Ocean?\r\n\r\nYou can also manually set the cache (on the whole machine since 1.12) to be smaller to avoid such problem.\r\n\r\nAbout restarting the process, I believe `/etc/inittab` is supposed to do it if you are on Ubuntu. On Arch, `systemd` can automatically restart a program that crashes."
