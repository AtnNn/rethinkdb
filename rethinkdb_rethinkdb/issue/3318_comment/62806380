      "@danielmewes It's `r.memoize()` not memorize.\r\n\r\nIt would presumably make the function (specifically, the outermost one) cache the results of inputs (in a map or hash table indexed by input value) and reuse them, saving a bunch of `.getAll` calls.\r\n\r\nIt would also be a nice-to-have magic optimization too."
