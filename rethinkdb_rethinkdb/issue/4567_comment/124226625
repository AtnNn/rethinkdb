      "And we try to label all issues for the Python driver with the [`Python` label](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3APython). Personally  keeping the first-party drivers in sync with the database makes my job testing a lot easier.\r\n\r\nI am going to mark this issue as duplicate to #1740. Further conversation on this should probably go there."
