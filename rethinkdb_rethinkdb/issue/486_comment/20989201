      "Alright, this is implemented pretty much to @timmaxw's specifications, and up in review 740.  Some notes:\r\n\r\nThe new command-line option is `--canonical-address HOST[:PORT]` and can be specified multiple times.  This option is available for all `rethinkdb` invocations that take a `--join` option, which would be porcelain, `serve`, `proxy`, and `admin`.  If port is omitted, it will use whatever port the cluster ends up listening on.  You cannot specify '0' for this port, as that would not make sense.\r\n\r\nIf no canonical addresses are given, we will use our bound local IP addresses (as we currently do) for intracluster routing.  If there are any canonical addresses, we will *only* use those.\r\n\r\nPeer addresses are now passed around the cluster as host/port pairs, which allows each node in the cluster to perform its own lookup of its peers' addresses.\r\n\r\nThis should allow port forwarding and tunneling and some other crazy stuff people do with their networks, but probably won't cover *every* situation."
