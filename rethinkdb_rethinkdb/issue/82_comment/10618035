      "With commit 7c0c0443e60df161c5d6e49856473ce9afbd69fa the data explorer keep the last state of the input. So what we save is not the last executed query but what was in the input before the user leave the data explorer.\r\n\r\nI did that for cases like this one:\r\n- The user start a query like r.table(\"foo\").eqJoin(\"id\",\r\n- The user doesn't remember the name of the other table\r\n- The user check #tables\r\n- The user come back to complete its query\r\n\r\nWell, in this case it's a little futile since we will suggest the databases and tables names, but I guess it's still a valid case.\r\n\r\nI will add the feature that will keep the cursor a little later."
