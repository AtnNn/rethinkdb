      "This is mostly done. I've been working on \"validating\" the examples by running them as tests and am now fixing the issues that result. To be clear, this only confirms that the example checks out as far as the driver is concerned. The actual queries are sent into a \"black hole\" TCP server that just returns a 'null' result.\r\n\r\nThis process has already uncovered a lot of problems with examples. The goal is to ensure that users who copy and paste an example into an interpreter for their language won't have any problems.\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky"
