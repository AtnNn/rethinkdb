        "**Summarized Issue: Basically socket.emit() only works once or -sometimes never- inside of cursor.each.(Javascript Driver)**\nI am inside an `io.on('connection',(socket)=>{ var externalSocketReference = socket; [rest of my code]}` and I have made a local reference to the socket object. Now somewhere in my code i have this \n\n``` js\ndb_realtime.tableWithUserFeed('spot', id,'user')\n                .then(function (cursor) {\n                    cursor.each(function (err, item) {\n                      externalSocketReference.emit('name',item);\n// I tried referring directly to the 'socket' variable  as well.\n                    });\n                });\n```\n\nThe only way it works(consistently) is if I add an eventListener on EventEmitter and then socket.emit() in the triggered event listener like so:\n\n``` js\ndb_realtime.tableWithUserFeed('spot', id,'user')\n                .then(function (cursor) {\n                    cursor.each(function (err, item) {\n                        myOwnEventEmitter.emit('name',item);\n                    });\n//and then...\nmyOwnEventEmitter.on('name',(item)=>(socket.emit('name',item);))\n```\n\n_If anyone is aware of this issue or knows how this can possibly happen please let me know.. It is eating me up..._\n"
