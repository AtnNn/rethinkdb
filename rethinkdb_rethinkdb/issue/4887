        "**Summarized Issue: Basically socket.emit() only works once or -sometimes never- inside of cursor.each.(Javascript Driver)**\r\nI am inside an `io.on('connection',(socket)=>{ var externalSocketReference = socket; [rest of my code]}` and I have made a local reference to the socket object. Now somewhere in my code i have this \r\n\r\n```js\r\ndb_realtime.tableWithUserFeed('spot', id,'user')\r\n                .then(function (cursor) {\r\n                    cursor.each(function (err, item) {\r\n                      externalSocketReference.emit('name',item);\r\n// I tried referring directly to the 'socket' variable  as well.\r\n                    });\r\n                });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only way it works(consistently) is if I add an eventListener on EventEmitter and then socket.emit() in the triggered event listener like so:\r\n```js\r\ndb_realtime.tableWithUserFeed('spot', id,'user')\r\n                .then(function (cursor) {\r\n                    cursor.each(function (err, item) {\r\n                        myOwnEventEmitter.emit('name',item);\r\n                    });\r\n//and then...\r\nmyOwnEventEmitter.on('name',(item)=>(socket.emit('name',item);))\r\n```\r\n\r\n_If anyone is aware of this issue or knows how this can possibly happen please let me know.. It is eating me up..._"
