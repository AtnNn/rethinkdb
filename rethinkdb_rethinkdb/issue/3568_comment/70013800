      "I'm a little torn on this; `datum_t()` is basically replacing `counted_t<datum_t>()` from before, so in my mind `datum_t() < datum_t::null()` is equivalent to `*counted_t<datum_t>() == *datum_t::null()`, which should clearly crash.  (Also, in general, it might make sense to force people to explicitly handle the uninitialized case rather than using uninitialized data like normal data.)"
