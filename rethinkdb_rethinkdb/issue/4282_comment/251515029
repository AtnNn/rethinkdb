      "Hello, \r\nIn order to make sure that I'm not repeating the same mistake with the non-used index here, I suppose I need _get_all_ only in the case of secondary indexes, right? I am benchmarking RethinkDB with YCSB (https://github.com/rethinkdb/YCSB) and I am using the Client .java as it is (so with _get_, not _getAll_ in reads and updates).. I have a sharded cluster so I know an index has been created with the primary key of my collection. Is this index used correctly? Can someone please confirm?\r\n"
