      "There is no shame in being a beginner or not professional - but you **NEED** to know at least some stuff, before you can compare anything.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I could compare my soap box car with your car: my soap box car is **MUCH** faster - as long as both cars are pushed uphill by a kid.\r\n\r\nYou can not compare a query on an indexed dataset in one db with a non indexed dataset in another db.\r\n\r\nBenchmarking is extremely hard to do - even more so, when you don't have enough knowledge.\r\n\r\nE.g. what is the insurance of the data actually being written to disk?\r\nMongoDB has a lot of ways to respond to an insert - the most loose will respond back, as soon as the software layer has received your request.\r\nThat is NO guarantee that it will actually end up on your disk.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is the data load you create - sure you might be able to insert 100.000 docs in x secs.\r\nBut how does that look in a \"real\" applications with 20+ connections and 100.000 updates, read and deletes going on at the same time?\r\n\r\nWhat about bulk queries?"
