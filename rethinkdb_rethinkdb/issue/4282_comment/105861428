      "I stand corrected about the lack of stats metrics(couldn't find them after 3 days in the docs). I still can't see reporting for slow queries. An amateur developer like me is going to miss creating an index here and there and debuging those is a nightmare without slow query logging.\r\n\r\nUpdated the Read/Find section to actually run the query, my mistake. \r\n\r\nIn updates - the results are for 100 000, I made a typo in the code block. It has an index on 'last_update' (https://github.com/martinrusev/rethinkvsmongo-benchmark/blob/master/benchmark.py#L65)\r\n\r\nAbout the benchmarks - I said in the post, that these are not \"proffesionally\" done and I would love to see RethinkDB support here - https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB"
