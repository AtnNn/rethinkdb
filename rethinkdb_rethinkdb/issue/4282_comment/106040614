      "@martinrusev: RethinkDB won't use an index unless you explicitly specify it in your query, even if there exists an index on that field. So `.filter({\"last_update\": ...})` will not use the index on `last_update` even though the index exists. You need to instead do `.get_all(..., index=\"last_update\")`. This affects both your Read and Update benchmarks.\r\n\r\nThere's something else strange going on as well, though I don't see what it is. You're reporting that RethinkDB does 100,000 updates with `.filter()` in 60 seconds, which is completely implausible; RethinkDB cannot scan 100,000 documents in only 600 microseconds without using an index. There's a similar problem with the read benchmark."
