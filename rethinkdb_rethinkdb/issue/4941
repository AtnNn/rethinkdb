        "Spend a while looking for the code of the ruby driver, only to realise it was in the main repository under a different folder.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a much much better practice to move individual drivers to their own repositories, in order to sort pull requests/issues more easily and also so finding them is easier.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents!"
