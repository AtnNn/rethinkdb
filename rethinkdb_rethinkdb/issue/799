        "In Python when I pass `use_outdated=False` to the table, it works as expected. However, when I pass `use_outdated=False` to the `run` function, it gets ignored. If I purposely make a mistake and pass `use_outdated1` to table I get an error \"table() got an unexpected keyword argument 'use_outdated1'\". However, when I pass `use_outdated1` to run, I get no error back and the query executes just fine.\n\nI suspect `run` just drops these arguments in Python (if it didn't the server would error). This is contrary to our API docs. @wmrowan -- could we fix the py driver (and write polyglot tests for this now that we have ability to test runopts)?\n"
