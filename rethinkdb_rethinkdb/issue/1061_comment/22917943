      "I have put some changes to the aggregation and transformation docs up in review 861.\r\n\r\nIn only those two sections, there was close no errors but there was a lot of undocumented behaviour. I opened a few issues for the behaviours I found that were both undocumented and unexpected.\r\n\r\nI still want to go over the many other sections and complete the documentation.\r\n\r\nI noticed three missing features of the API page that would make it a lot more useful:\r\n\r\n* Linking to other sections. Saying that \"with_fields is just has_fields followed by pluck\" would be a lot more useful if has_fields and pluck were links.\r\n\r\n* A section explaining the different concepts and types used: selectors, predicates, streams, sequences, etc...\r\n\r\n* Sample input and output for all the examples. I believe that more than half of the examples are too cryptic for beginners."
