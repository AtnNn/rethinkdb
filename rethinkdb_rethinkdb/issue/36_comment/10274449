      "Hi there.\r\n\r\nThis is expected behavior. Although less necessary for our product since it detects an instance using its data store automatically and also fails if requested ports are already in use, this helps to interface with init scripts and the like which demand this sort of strict behavior (creating the pid file only if it is not already present and deleting it only on clean exit).\r\n\r\nIf you are just trying to get the pid of the launched daemon, you could use the $! option in the shell after launching the process into the background. Would this work for you?\r\n"
