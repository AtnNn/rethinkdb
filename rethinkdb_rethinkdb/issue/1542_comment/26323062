      "You can definitely tack on a filter at the end of the union.\r\n\r\nWe've been thinking of how to define functions on top of queries (which is basically equivalent to non-materialized views). Unfortunately we're completely focused on performance and scalability, so this won't happen for a while, but we'll try to get to it post 2.0.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, note that you can assign Rethink queries to variables in your programming language of choice. For example, in Python:\r\n\r\n```\r\nq = r.db('demo').table('metrics-000').union(r.db('demo').table('metrics-001')).union(r.db('demo').table('metrics-002'))\r\nq1 = q.filter(...)\r\nq1.run(conn)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis might help you accomplish what you're looking for (basically, aliases) without a specialized feature. Hope this helps. Moving to backlog for now."
