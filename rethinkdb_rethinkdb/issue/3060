        "I got bitten yesterday when trying to play with geospatial indexes.\r\n\r\nWhen we retrieve a geo value, the coordinates are `[longitude, latitude]`.\r\nIt's confusing since our system uses `[latitude, longitude]` everywhere. We should display `[longitude, latitude]` only when people use the `toGeojson` command.\r\n\r\nIt's probably annoying to do, but it seems worth doing it before releasing 1.15.\r\n\r\nPutting in 1.15 for now -- ping @coffeemug, any thoughts on this?"
