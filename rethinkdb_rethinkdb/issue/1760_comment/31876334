      "I ran into this same issue i am running. RethinkDB 1.11.2-223-g8ca1a4 the server that is getting the backfill data has 2gb of memory when rethinkdb is not running its using 200mb. The table cache is only 1gb but the process keeps getting OOM. meaning some how rethinkdb uses 1800M before getting killed. And since backfilling does not resume from where it left off it just keeps happening. "
