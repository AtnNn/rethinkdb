      "Thanks @anatol. I wish I had known to use `-Wno-error`.\r\n\r\nI am rewriting `support.mk` in the `improved_fetch` branch, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/atnnn/improved_fetch/mk/support/pkg/v8.sh\r\n\r\nReplacing `python` with `python2` will not work on distributions that do not have the `python2` alias for python. Perhaps the configure script should find the correct python 2 executable."
