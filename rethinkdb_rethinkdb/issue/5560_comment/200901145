      "We don't have a js to X converter.\r\n\r\nBut you may be able to write one using a js parser like [esprima](http://esprima.org/). I wrote a [python to js/java/ruby converter](https://github.com/deontologician/multireql) that might give you a start on how to build one.\r\n\r\nThere's also issue #4171 for allowing different languages in the dataexplorer"
