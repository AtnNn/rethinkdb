        "Currently there is no way to run `.includes()` on an index, which makes it the only geospatial query that doesn't have a corresponding index-aware function.\n#### Current situation:\n\n``` js\nr\n  .table('MyCoolData')\n  .getIntersecting(somePolygon, { index: 'area' })\n  .filter((doc) => somePolygon.includes(doc('area')))\n```\n- Gets all polygons that intersect (overfetching!)\n- Runs filter on all of these polygons to see which ones are actually included (huge waste of CPU)\n#### Proposed solution:\n\n``` js\nr\n  .table('MyCoolData')\n  .getIncluded(somePolygon, { index: 'area' })\n```\n- Only gets polygons that are actually included\n\nAnd hopefully allows multiple arguments to minimize even more performance bottlenecks (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5885)\n"
