      "Think of the case where you have 10000 active users and you want to subscribe to a change on a document for each of them.  If we only support subscribing with a filter, you have to run 10000 ReQL predicates, which is slow.  If we support subscribing to a `get`, you just have to do one lookup in a map.\r\n\r\nAlso, putting the filters on the shards isn't completely trivial.  You still only want to send one cluster message per write/subscribed-machine pair, so you'd have to do the filter on the shard and then send a message to the subscribed machine telling it which subscribing changefeeds the write should be passed on to."
