      "> In other words, it should return the whole table?\r\n\r\nYes, though that probably wouldn't be very useful. I was thinking something of this sort:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nr.table('foo').filter(predicate).changes(return_all=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are some questions about what this means (does the `filter` apply to new values, for example?) but roughly that's what I was thinking."
