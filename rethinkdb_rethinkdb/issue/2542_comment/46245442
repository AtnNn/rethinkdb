      "In particular, the most important performance improvement to look for right now is that of: not having to send every write to every single changefeed-listening parser in the cluster.  Making btree nodes also not have to iterate through a list of changefeed listeners (by registering point-listeners with a map by key, on the store end?) is a relatively miniscule benefit."
