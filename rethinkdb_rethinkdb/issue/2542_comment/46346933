      "> Also, I think it would be useful to have an optarg that makes `r.table('foo').get(id).changes()` return as its first change object the actual value of `r.table('foo').get(id)`.\r\n\r\nIf possible, we should allow this not just for `.get().changes()` but for `.changes()` in general. We just released an hour ago, and people are already asking about this on IRC."
