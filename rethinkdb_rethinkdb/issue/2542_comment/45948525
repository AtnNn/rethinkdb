      "Also, I think it would be useful to have an optarg that makes `r.table('foo').get(id).changes()` return as its first change object the actual value of `r.table('foo').get(id)`.  I think the most common use case for this is \"get me this row and tell me when it changes\", which is hard to do by composing a `get` and a `changes` call because you might miss a change in-between."
