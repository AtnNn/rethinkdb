        "I have just two servers in cluster. Now when need more I can add to my config:\n\n```\njoin=ip:port\njoin=ip1:port\n```\n\n**Question(s) no 1**.\nand that is fine, but now when doing restart on node where i have that joins in config, what will happen to my app?\nDoes proxy routes traffic to other nodes?\n\n**Question(s) no 2**. is about Proxy server when want to add more nodes.\nI need to restart (better say kill ) proxy script that is adding joins to proxy --join ip:port --join ip1:port and so on.\n\nBy killing that my app will go to some exception or server 500 error and I will have downtime.\nMy question is how to tell proxy that one,  two or more servers are now in cluster?\n\nIn your docs you are saying that app can connect to localhost, but you are forgetting what if i have \n10 or more app servers. Doing proxy join -- on each of them would be just nightmare for devOps but\nthen this would solve my **Question no 2** since my app will never lose connection to db like this.\n\n**Question no 3.**\nIs there some sort of \"include\" directive where I can keep for example joins?\n\nAnyway, I really hope that you can provide some answers regarding this and maybe add to documentation lets say some \"infrastructure sample\".\n"
