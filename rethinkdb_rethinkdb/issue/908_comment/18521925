      "Thanks for submitting, this is definitely a problem. The cache quote system will be significantly improved very soon (tables will be able to steal ram from each other when possible, the quotas will be scaled back based on the amount of ram on each machine, etc.) This is a dup of #97, so I'm closing this issue -- please track #97 for progress on this.\r\n\r\nThis won't make it into 1.6, but we'll try to get this done ASAP."
