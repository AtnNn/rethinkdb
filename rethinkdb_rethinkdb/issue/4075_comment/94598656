      "Why is the `ca_certs` option required ? If the server has a valid verified certificate chain (i.e. a certificate bought from a trusted CA) then most SSL implementations verify it on their own (honestly I don't know how but I imagine most of them use openssl underneath ?). Isn't it the case with ruby also ?"
