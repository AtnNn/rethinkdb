      "Thanks a bunch for the patch @jipperinbham.\r\n\r\n@mlucy Can you take a look at the code please? (@jipperinbham has already signed the CLA)\r\n\r\nI think we might want to polish the options that `r.connect` takes a bit, but I haven't thought through it in detail yet.\r\n\r\nAnother question I had: Is the `openssl` module something that's usually available in a Ruby setup? If not, we should try to find a way to require it only if ssl is actually being used."
