      "The single `ssl` option sounds good.\r\n\r\n@jipperinbham don't worry about the testing, we will take care of that.\r\n@larkost any ideas for how we could test SSL connectivity without having native SSL support in the server and ideally without adding too many dependencies? Another tool that we could use in the tests besides haproxy and nginx is https://www.stunnel.org/index.html ."
