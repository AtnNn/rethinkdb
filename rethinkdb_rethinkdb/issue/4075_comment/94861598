      "@jipperinbham exactly, **most**. It is still however possible to use a certificate with a valid chain, and in that case I don't want to use the ca_certs argument when connecting with the driver, therefore it must be an optional argument.\r\n\r\nBy the way I do use a certificate with a valid chain on my servers because they are cheap and I don't want to keep distributing certificates to the clients :) And they will be [free](https://letsencrypt.org/) soon-ish :)"
