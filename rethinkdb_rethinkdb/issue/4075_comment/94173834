      "Ok, so I made the options change to nest the SSL specific options in the `:ssl` Hash. Currently, the only supported and required option is `ca_certs`.\r\n\r\nre: tests, this seems a bit tricky as you'll need a proxy (Haproxy, nginx or other) running to do the SSL certificate validation. Open to suggestions on how best to do that."
