      "This looks good to me aside from the two small comments.  Thanks for the contribution, @jipperinbham !\r\n\r\nI think I agree with @danielmewes that turning on SSL automatically when you pass an argument starting with `ssl` is a little bit too much magic.  I think we should instead make `connect` take a single optional argument `ssl` which can be set to whatever options the user wants to pass through to `create_context`, and if that argument isn't set we don't turn on SSL.  (So it would look like `.connect(port: 100, ssl: {opt1: true, opt2: true))` instead of `.connect(port: 100, sslopt1: true, sslopt2: true)`.)  @jipperinbham, @danielmewes, how does that sound to you?\r\n\r\n@danielmewes -- We'll also need to write some documentation for this, and a test so the code doesn't bitrot.  If we do what I suggested above, I think we can get away with just adding documentation for the `ssl` optarg to the `connect` command."
