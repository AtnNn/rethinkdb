      "The graphs are fixed in `michel_531_stats`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not reading the good stats or the stats reported in `/ajax/stat` are incorrect.\r\nI rougly have two times more writes reported when I'm doing one read for one write (reported by the javascript driver).\r\n\r\nI'm just checking btree-primary in each serializers (the 4 shards_X - which are I assume the 4 internal hash shards). Do I have to look for something else too?"
