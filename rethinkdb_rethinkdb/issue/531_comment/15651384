      "I just run some more tests. I'm using the JavaScript driver to to writes and reads.\r\nAll queries successfully return.\r\n\r\nUsing different workloads (low workloads - about 10 queries per seconds), tt seems that the number of writes is always 4 times more important to what it should be.\r\nThe number of reads seems to match what the driver tells me.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner it's back in your court."
