        "Currently the java driver is not fully integrated into our existing build infrastructure. I've created a makefile and maybe 3/4ths of what's needed, but this will probably require @AtnNn 's touch to make sure all of the t's are dotted and i's crossed.\n\nSome issues I know of:\n1. Dependencies are not handled (except for java library dependencies)\n   - it assumes gradle 2.7+, java 8, python and mako are all installed on the system and in the path etc.\n2. Make is not being utilized to skip builds of files that are already built\n   - metajava.py does a make-like timestamp check, but it's a little flaky. I didn't use make because the files being included is pretty dynamic and I didn't want to hard code them all into the make file. There may be a better way to do this I'm not aware of.\n   - this only means from template -> java file conversion with metajava.py. Gradle handles java compilation stuff just fine once the java files are output.\n3. `make publish` and `make test` are not implemented (see also #5001 for deploying todos)\n"
