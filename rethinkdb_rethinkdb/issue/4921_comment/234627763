      "@mez Part of this could be because RethinkDB is relatively strict about how much unsaved data it allows to sit in memory at any point (even in soft durability mode, which `rethinkdb import` uses by default as you mention). I suspect this isn't the only thing, but it might play a role. You might also want to check what the cache size is that the RethinkDB server uses. It's possible that you can get more performance by increasing the cache size manually (`--cache-size` parameter)."
