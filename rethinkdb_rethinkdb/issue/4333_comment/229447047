      "MultiPolygon support is **incredibly** important for doing any geospatial work. Without it, RethinkDB isn't a viable candidate for even basic geospatial work.\r\n\r\nJust to outline how necessary this is, when working with cities and states in the United States:\r\n- 11 of 56 states/territories are multipolygons (~5%)\r\n- 3009 of 29910 cities are multipolygons (~10%)\r\n\r\nWe would **love** to use RethinkDB in the civic space but without this (and fixes to other major geospatial bottlenecks) it isn't possible."
