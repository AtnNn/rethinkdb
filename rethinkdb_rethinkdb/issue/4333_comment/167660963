      "I'm also a big +1 on implementing this.\r\n\r\nWe're trying to help farmers in California survive the drought (and a bunch of new regulations as a result of said drought), so we're working with a lot of agriculture, energy, and water management data. One of our biggest pain points with all these large data sets is the lack of Multi-Geometries in RethinkDB. We have a couple hacky workarounds, but native Multi-Geometry support would be _hugely_ beneficial to us.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help in any way I can."
