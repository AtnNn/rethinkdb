      "@dekimir That's right. `append_region` can't enforce it I think because the block size passed to the `blob_t` constructor isn't saved anywhere. Theoretically it could perform the same guarantee checks that are in the constructor a second time though I think, since it should know the `maxreflen`. That would of course come with a runtime overhead, albeit likely a small one."
