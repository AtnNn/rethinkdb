      "@neumino Yeah, I accidentally deleted it once and never again, haha. \r\n\r\nI actually made this change on my local version and it's saved me a lot of second guessing. Despite knowing where all the buttons are, when I have a few databases with a lot of tables I still found myself scrolling down to the database I was currently using and expecting to interact with it directly. I also would expect when the \"Add Table\" button is clicked from the table header the modal select box is changed to that table, which is why I left the DB id there. I haven't yet sat down to look for that portion of the JS.\r\n\r\nLike @coffeemug I too don't believe the \"Delete Database\" should be removed, but an alternative might be to remove it from each table header and to place it at the top with a modal window that gives a drop-down (defaulted to blank) then a confirm. This might also help prevent accidentals without coloring since it becomes a 2-step process. Another idea might be to keep it the way it currently is (uncolored) but to have the GitHub style delete confirmation, where you have to retype the table name.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug Sweet, congrats! I look forward to it. No rush on this matter, I made this change locally and it helped me and I know you guys are busy doing awesome stuff so I thought I'd share and help out with something little.\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky A pleasure, thanks for making such a great product :)"
