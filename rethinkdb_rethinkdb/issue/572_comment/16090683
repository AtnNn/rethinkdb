      "I've decided to close this pull request because it addresses what I absolutely consider to be a key weakness in the table view, but doesn't do enough to address it. I've opened an issue (#629) and put together a short plan to prevent accidental database deletions.\r\n\r\n@neumino and I discussed several options for improving the table view, and we decided to do the following:\r\n\r\n  - __Add a two-step process to database deletion.__ Clicking _Delete database_ will require you to type in the database name before deletion is allowed to occur; deleting a table already has a similar two-step process (click a checkbox on the table view, then confirm a dialog box). Allowing people to easily delete databases is very dangerous. This approach has worked for many systems: Github's _Delete repository_ modal is the first that comes to mind.\r\n  - __Add icons to buttons.__ This was supposed to be done pre-release, but I spent time polishing other aspects of the UI. Icons will significantly improve visibility and clarity of buttons (as opposed to simply reading text).\r\n\r\nWe considered moving buttons around, but that introduces other problems:\r\n  - Adding a global _Delete database_ button would clutter the top of the table view with four buttons.\r\n  - Moving the _Add database_ and _Delete database_ buttons to the top, and the _Add table_ and _Delete table_ buttons to each database makes removing tables more confusing (we have checkboxes on each table, but they would only take effect on a subset when the right button is clicked?)\r\n\r\nOther ideas considered and set aside:\r\n  - Adding colors to the buttons makes the page seem like a rainbow (bright splashes of red are wholly distracting, but effective!)\r\n  - Drop-down menus for dangerous operations seems like an easy out, but drop-downs are a seductive way to bury operations that are too annoying to think about, and are generally irritating to users.\r\n\r\n@dparlevliet, thanks for bringing this to our attention again, it's been bothering me for a while. I've opened #629 with a concrete set of tasks based on this discussion that will hopefully help people avoid accidentally deleting their data. :smiley: \r\n\r\nIf you would continue to like using the red delete database buttons, you can keep a forked branch with the change, or consider using something like Stylish (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) to change the style to red. I use it myself on several sites where the font styles or color schemes are unpalatable."
