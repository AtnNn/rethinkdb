      "Hello @dparlevliet!\r\n\r\nFirst, thanks for the pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore releasing 1.2, I wanted to remove the delete buttons because I thought they were too dangerous.\r\nI have clicked on \"delete a database\" multiple times since (and confirm the delete) when I didn't wanted to - but I am probably not an usual user so I try not to give too much importance to my flow of actions. \r\n@dparlevliet did you accidentally delete a database too?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, having the delete button red is not a bad idea. But I think it gives too much importance to a button that doesn't deserve it. @mglukhovsky any thoughts?\r\n\r\nIf I'm not mistaken, @coffeemug was strongly opposed to the idea of moving the delete button in the database view.\r\nIMO the only reason to keep this button is because we create a default database test that people want to delete the first time they see it (or at least that I delete every time I have set up rethinkdb on my server). See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/301\r\n"
