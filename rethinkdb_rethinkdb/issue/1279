        "RethinkDB, when starting up normally with a serve or porcelain command, prints the RethinkDB version and `uname -r` info.  Running `rethinkdb --version` just gets you the RethinkDB version, and it doesn't tell you what type of machine you're running on.\r\n\r\n* `rethinkdb --version` should also print the `uname -r` info that tells what machine you're on.\r\n* Also, the RethinkDB version should tell what the target architecture of the RethinkDB executable is, since that's not necessarily the same as the machine architecture.  You can run 32-bit executables on 64-bit systems."
