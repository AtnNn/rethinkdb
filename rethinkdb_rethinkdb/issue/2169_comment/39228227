      "Also we should try to build an API for our users and not the web interface (I just wrote for the web interface needs earlier)\r\nI'm pretty sure that no matter what we come up with, it's going to be nicer to use than what the web interface using now, so I'm not too much worried.\r\n\r\nWe should try to make it nicer for users to do operations like\r\n- update replica/ack for a table\r\n- update replica/acks for some tables\r\n- shard a table\r\n- retrieve issues\r\n\r\nAlso how is a user going to shard?\r\nAsking them to provide a range (like we do in the CLI) is really not friendly. Could we:\r\n- move to hash shards\r\n- or move the logic to compute balanced shards on the server\r\n"
