      "@neumino Will we also need `r.admin(\"progress\")` for backfilling progress information?\r\nI actually don't like the name \"progress\" very much. I think it would be much nicer to have an admin table \"background_tasks\" that would list both backfill as well as secondary index constructions.\r\n\r\nObtaining the progress of sindexes is not as low-overhead on the server as getting the progress of a given backfill though (partially because it requires going to all shards and replicas, partially because it requires acquiring a lock in the btree).\r\nI suggest that for the first revision we only mention backfills in `r.admin(\"background_tasks\")`, so it would have the same information as `ajax/progress` has now. We can later add other types of background tasks to it."
