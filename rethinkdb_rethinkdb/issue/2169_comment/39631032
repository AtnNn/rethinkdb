      "The web interface uses the blueprints in a few places, but the blueprint information could probably be injected in r.admin(\"tables\") I think.\r\n\r\nLike @danielmewes pointed out, I would need something like `r.admin(\"progress\")` for backfilling.\r\n\r\nIf would also need the distribution of the keys in a table (to compute shards, and to display the graph about shards. I could use `between(..).count()` but that's slower than the distribution as far as I understand.\r\n\r\nThen if we want to completely get ride of `/ajax`, the web interface would require all the commands to update blueprints.\r\n\r\nThat's stretchig things, but it's part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2012 and for my own curiosity -- could we have feeds on `r.admin` commands?"
