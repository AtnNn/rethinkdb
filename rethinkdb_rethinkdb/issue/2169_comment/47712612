      "If we just want to let people set replicas, we can add new optargs to `tableCreate`. It's not the most fancy syntax for sure, but it seems way less work than adding tons of new commands.\r\n\r\nIf people want to shard, we can assume that they are going to use uuid, and we can compute the split points without any data.\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.tableCreate(\"foo\", {primary: <datacenter_uuid>, replicas: {<datacenter_uuid>: <number>} })\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbout `any`/`universe`, the thing that is hard to understand is that `any` overlaps with other datacenters. So when you increase the number of replicas in a datacenter `X`, you don't expect to see a new replica in datacenter `Y`.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout pinning machines, we do allow it. We do remove the pins if the shards change though."
