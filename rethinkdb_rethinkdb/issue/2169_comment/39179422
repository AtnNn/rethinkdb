      "A few suggestions/comments:\r\n- We currently compress the data, and won't be able to do it with ReQL\r\n- The web interface sometimes need to query the directory by machine, and sometimes by table, so we'll still have to pull the whole directory. We may want to flatten everything and let people do filter/joins to create some hierarchy?\r\n- We should remove obscure fields like `replier_present`\r\n- We should aggregate things - like hash shards, activity_map etc.\r\n- We should match the blueprints/directory roles if we can. `role_primary` <-> `primary`, `role_secondary`<->`secondary`, etc.\r\n- We can still have uuid for keys but have descriptive documents. It would probably more convenient for the web interface.\r\n- Put tables in databases if we don't flatten everything\r\n- Put servers in datacenter if we don't flatten everything\r\n- Use the same definition of a replica as in the web interface or at least never have \"silent\" fields (like not having a field replica when a datacenter is primary and has no secondary)\r\n- It would be really nice if we were not converting shard ranges to JSON, and if we were not converting keys values by prefixing them with `S%23` and things like that\r\n- In stat, if we can note use `shard_<X>` in the same level as other fields, it would make me really happy\r\n- Have better issues, especially for unsatisfiable goals - This was painful to write https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/admin/static/coffee/resolve_issues.coffee#L401"
