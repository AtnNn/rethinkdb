      "I'm not sure if this belongs in this thread, but MongoDB has something called [\"replica tag sets\"](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets/) that is similar to our concept of a \"datacenter\" but more powerful. They allow assigning arbitrary key-value pairs to each machine and then selecting machines that match those key-value pairs, according to a complicated selection procedure that is different for read and write queries. This allows them to express durability settings like \"please only acknowledge this write when at least two different machines in different racks of the Virginia data center have received it\"."
