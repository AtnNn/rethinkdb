      "What about doing the admin pseudo-table from a table? Like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table(...).admin.update({\"shards\": 3,\r\n                           \"primary_goal\": \"any\",\r\n                           \"secondary_goal\": [\"us_east\", \"us_east\"]})\r\n/* get progress updates with a feed */\r\nr.table(...).admin.changes()(\"rebalance_progress\")\r\n```\r\nSimilarly for databases:\r\n```javascript\r\nr.db(...).admin.update(...)\r\n```\r\nThe other objects like shards/issues/machines/directories/datacenters don't correspond to an object already in reql, but I think it would be a shame to have to manage table/database stuff by going to a different top-level entity like `r.admin(\"databases\")(\"db_name\")`"
