      "> If would also need the distribution of the keys in a table (to compute shards, and to display the graph about shards.\r\n\r\nThe second level of the API will take care of sharding -- it should never be done in JavaScript. You'll be able to say `r.table('foo').shard(5)` (or something of the sort). We can also add something like `r.table('foo').shard_distribution()` to get the necessary information about how things are distributed."
