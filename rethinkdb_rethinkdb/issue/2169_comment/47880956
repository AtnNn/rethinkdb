      "I think this is a great issue to work on right away:\r\n\r\n- Lots of people need it yesterday\r\n- It's delightfully announce-able\r\n- It will force us to make some important decisions on clustering architecture we've been procrastinating on\r\n\r\nI think we should do this next, but I don't think we shouldn't ship a partial API. I think the API should be complete enough to rewrite the admin CLI entirely as a Python script using the official Python driver.\r\n\r\nI think that the most important open question we have to figure out is #1862. Once that's settled, it should be relatively easy to come up with a goals API we won't have to change later."
