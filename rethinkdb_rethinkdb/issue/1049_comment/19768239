      "The batched_replaces_response_t is copied mostly through copying of write_response_t (70 %).\r\n\r\nOther sources are master_access_t<rdb_protocol_t>::write(const &write_t, write_response_t*, ...)\r\nsome boost::variant function which is too long to fit on my two screens thanks to loads of template arguments and store_listener_response (from broadcaster.cc).\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, things get a bit unclear from write_response_t on, as there seem to be a number of places from where it gets called without any of them being clearly dominant.\r\n\r\nDetails are in /home/daniel/rethinkdb/oprof/calltree-insert.out on deadshot (open with kcachegrind as always)."
