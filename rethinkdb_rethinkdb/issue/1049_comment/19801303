I meant Datum, *not* datum_t.\r\n\r\n**Just to repeat: it are *Datum* objects that are copied (as generated from ql2.proto).**\r\n\r\n@jdoliner: You were absolutely right then, I just checked and I cannot see any copying of *datum_t*. The datum_t(Datum) constructor was also eating 6% of the CPU, but that's probably completely unrelated."
