      "@danielmewes -- when you say `Datum_t`, do you mean `Datum` or `datum_t`?\r\n\r\nIt's quite plausible that we're copying `Datum` around more than we need to.  In particular, we never hoisted the scope of the `map_wire_func_t` in each `point_replace_t` up into `batched_replaces_t`, and we never hoisted up the `optargs` either, so we're passing around a bajillion copies of each `Datum` that's in either of those."
