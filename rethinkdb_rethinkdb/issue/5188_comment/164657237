      "Ok, I was under the impression the ordering would always be correct by replacing the `old_val` with the `new_val`. I still think being able to go right to the changed item and modifying it is useful, vs. requiring that everyone treat `new_val` and `old_val` as completely separate events. For example, in UIs it's common to want to do animations based on a changed field."
