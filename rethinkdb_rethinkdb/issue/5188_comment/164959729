      "I think keeping the 5 different `types` is better for the reasons that were discussed.\r\n\r\nI'm torn on whether turning this on by default is actually going to push developers towards looking at the `type` rather than just distinguishing based on whether `old_val` and `new_val` are set.\r\n\r\nI think that either having it on or off by default would be a good solution. Everything else being equal, I'd give a slight preference for having it off by default simply because that gives us backwards compatibility.\r\nIt's also likely that users who care about handling different types will already be looking at the `changes` documentation to figure out what types events are even possible, in which case the additional optarg will be easy to discover."
