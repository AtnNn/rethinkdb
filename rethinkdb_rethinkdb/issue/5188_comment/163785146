      "I like this, for readability/maintainability's sake.\r\n\r\nThere's not a lot of difference, but I prefer @deontologician's `\"type\"` values in the OP (`\"added\"` etc), because they more clearly imply that this is an event stream, as opposed to the `\"action\"` values like `\"insert\"` a la #4194 which could be construed as commands (these objects are not always going to be used that way.)\r\n\r\nAs secondary benefit, languages like Go have very verbose \"exists in a map\" syntax ([it requires multiple statements](https://golang.org/src/expvar/expvar.go#L158)), so the `new_val`/`old_val` if-else chains are even worse there, and Go has `switch` on strings, which would be very clean."
