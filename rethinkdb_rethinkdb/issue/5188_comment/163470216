      "This is almost the same as https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4194, except that the field name and string values are different:\r\n\r\n> The proposal is to encode this information explicitly by adding an additional field. For example\r\n> `action: 'delete'`\r\n> `action: 'insert'`\r\n> `action: 'replace'`\r\n> `action: 'initial'`\r\n\r\nI'm going to close the other one, because this one has the nicer write up.\r\n\r\nAnother \"Pro\" from the other issue:\r\nThe lack of a `type`/`action` field sometimes actually makes it impossible to know what happened.\r\na) Setting the value of a changefeed item to the value `null` and\r\nb) deleting a changefeed value\r\nare currently undistinguishable."
