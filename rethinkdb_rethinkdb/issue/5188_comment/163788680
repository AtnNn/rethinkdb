      "Actually I take that back:\r\n> I don't see a reason for why we shouldn't be able to do the same for changefeeds though, if it's desired.\r\n\r\nUsually a write fails if not enough replicas are available, or the primary isn't reachable, right? Neither case would allow us to generate corresponding changefeed events with our current architecture.\r\nIf the primary isn't available, we can't generate an event because the changefeed events are generated on the primary.\r\nIf not enough replicas are available, we only realize that after we've already emitted the change event from the primary, the way things currently work.\r\n\r\nI was originally thinking of `unchanged` writes, that leave a document at the same value. Emitting an event for those might be possible."
