      "With leaderboards, definitely. In my case, I've written a lot of abstractions on top of changefeeds, and you just don't have the information about how they're going to be used, so the default is to split it out.\r\n\r\nBut, we aren't fundamentally changing the structure in a way that makes you choose one strategy over the other. If `new_val`, `old_val` is all you need, you can just ignore the type field. It shouldn't have many downsides"
