      "I'm on the same page with @mlucy here. I think `state` and `type` are very different things. In fact you'd never get a document with both fields according to the current proposal (though see below).\r\n\r\nI can see the appeal of grouping multiple changefeed options into easier to understand \"presets\"/verbosity levels, but I don't think those should be the only way to configure the options. I can see a lot of use cases where users won't be interested in the `type` field, but would still want `state` documents for example.\r\nAt the same time, I don't think we're having enough options yet to warrant having the verbosity setting *in addition* to the individual arguments. I think that would only make the API more confusing.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnrelated to this, I think we should also have a `type: \"state\"` value that we put into state documents when `include_states` is set. I forgot about those in the list of `type` values above."
