      "In addition we should have `type: \"state\"` (for `includeStates`).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how `type: \"error\"` would work. Are you suggesting that we emit an event on the changefeed if someone tries to perform a write, but the write fails? I assumed #5041 was only about the `returnChanges` result, not for changefeeds. I don't see a reason for why we shouldn't be able to do the same for changefeeds though, if it's desired."
