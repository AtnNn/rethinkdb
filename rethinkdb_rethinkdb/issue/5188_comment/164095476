      "That might be an argument for combining `add` and `initial` into a single type and letting people who really care distinguish them by checking for the existence of an `old_val` field.  (And doing the same for `remove`/`uninitial`.)\r\n\r\nI would guess 95% of code will want to handle them the same way, and it will avoid nasty problems like people writing code that doesn't handle `uninitial` values since they're so rare they might not show up in testing."
