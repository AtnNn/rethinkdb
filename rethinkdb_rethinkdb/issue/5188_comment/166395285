      "A bunch of little things (incremental API improvements, implying use of `old_val`/`new_val` null-ness is better if useful, and consistency with the other options being default-off optargs) now add up to me now preferring 5/off for this. As @mlucy said, moving to 5/on later (my second preference) is an easy, compatible change to make."
