      "@coffeemug -- I don't think I understand what you're proposing.  You can't include types \"instead\" of states because they contain different information.  For example, let's say you write `r.table('test').changes(include_initial: true)` and you have types but no states, and no writes occur -- how do you know when you've read the last document?  Knowing that the type of every event is `initial` doesn't tell you when you're done, but a `{state: 'ready'}` document would.\r\n\r\nIn general types and states convey completely different things: the type tells you something about a particular change, while the state tells you something about the stream of changes as a whole."
