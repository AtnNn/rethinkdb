      "Err, so this is a problem with Chrome. I don't have the same behavior this problem with Firefox.\r\n\r\nWell you can still feel that the browser needs some time to render an array of `50000` elements, but that's just because we add a lot of nodes in the DOM.\r\nMoving to backlog. I have a few ideas I can try to skip the call to innerWidth.\r\n\r\nNote that I don't have this problem if the array is not nested since we are going to just display the first 40 elements."
