      "@danielmewes -- I disagree pretty strongly, I think this is a straight-up bug.  `r.table('test').has_fields('foo')` should be identical to `r.table('test').filter{|row| row.has_fields('foo')}`.  The latter returns a selection, so the former should as well; it's literally an implementation bug that `obj_or_seq_op_term_t` discards the selection property after it applies the filter.\r\n\r\n(Resetting the state since there's disagreement and I don't want us to forget to talk about it because the issue is buried.)"
