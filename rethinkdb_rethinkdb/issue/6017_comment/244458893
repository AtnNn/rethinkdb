      "@robertjpayne It is deterministic, though the details of the generated JSON string could change in some future version (so I'd recommend using the hashing only for things for which you can regenerate the hashes without too much hassle if necessary).\r\n\r\nYou might also need to be careful if you have floating point numbers in your documents. The generated JSON should be stable on a given platform, but might not be identical across different platforms (e.g. Linux vs. OS X) due to potential differences in rounding."
