      "@coffeemug Users are actually going to see this value pretty quickly I think. Neither javascript nor Ruby has a native duration type so all it's going to take is someone writing a query like:\r\n\r\n```Ruby\r\nr.table(\"users\").map{|x| x.merge({:membership_duration => DateTime.now() - x[:date_joined]})}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand they're going to be getting back raw psuedo types. I feel like `$__reql_type__` is just needlessly ugly and something users *will* being seeing fairly frequently (and something driver developers will be typing fairly frequently). My preferences would be:\r\n\r\n1. `__reql_type__` (very readable, and I've really yet to see evidence that this is an actual standard)\r\n2. `$reql_type` (also fairly readable, perhaps collision prone)\r\n3. `$__reql_type__` (needlessly ugly)\r\n\r\nAlso I'm increasingly dubious that this is in anyway a standard, the number one hit on google for \"dollar magic values JSON\" is this issue and I can't find a single other mention of it. Also google has a JSON style guideline which makes no mention of this."
