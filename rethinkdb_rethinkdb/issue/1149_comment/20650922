      "I sort of prefer `$__reql_type__` because it seems an order of magnitude less likely to cause a conflict, and because frankly magic strings should be ugly sometimes.  I could plausibly imagine myself typing `$reql_type` in a normal ruby program because global variables start with `$`; I can't imagine myself typing `$__reql_type__` in a normal ruby program."
