      "Eh, I feel like if `$` is the standard then we should use only that (i.e. `$reql_type`) and if we're not satisfied that it's sufficiently resistant to collisions then we should use something else. Combining 2 standards just seems weird and like it's not going to feel familiar to people who know either standard."
