      "> @coffeemug Users are actually going to see this value pretty quickly I think.\r\n\r\nI think that for things like duration we might want to convert the reql object to raw numbers on the driver side. It will lose the property that we can put it back in and get the same type, but I think it's *way* friendlier than the alternative.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I don't have a strong opinion on this. Whatever we choose is fine by me."
