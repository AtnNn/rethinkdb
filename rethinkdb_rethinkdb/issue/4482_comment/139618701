      "After having seen a few production clusters on 2.1, the \"Raft election timed out. Starting a new election for term\" and similar log messages are definitely somewhat annoying, since in some situations they repeat every couple seconds or so for each table.\r\n\r\nWe could maybe aggregate those messages into something like \"n Raft elections have timed out.\" and print them only occasionally (probably with decreasing frequency)."
