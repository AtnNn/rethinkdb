      "We ran into this issue in our application more than once. Our system is distributed and relies heavily on creating tables at runtime (from code). It is easy to run into the case where two table of same name be created, even we are using distributed lock. May be our design is not good enough to prevent the case but since it is considered a database issue (and quite critical one), I think it is better to be taken care within rethinkdb. I would very much appreciate if it would be fixed soon!"
