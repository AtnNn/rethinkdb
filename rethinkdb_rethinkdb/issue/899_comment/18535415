      "Unfortunately it's not that easy for range mutation operations. We made the decision on the server/language side to complete the update operation on all rows where it's possible, and I still firmly believe it's a good idea (on other hand, aborting a range operation because of one bad row is a bad idea).\r\n\r\nI do agree that if *any* errors occurred in the process, we should probably pass them to the `err` callback argument. This way people would only have to check this object, which sounds really nice.\r\n\r\n@wmrowan and others -- what do you think about this proposal?"
