      "> The funny thing is that you only return the first error anyway, so why not just return that as the error parameter?\r\n\r\nThat's a really interesting point :) What we wanted to accomplish was to return a consistent result for all update operations (consistent across the drivers as well). A mutation operation might contain:\r\n\r\n* no errors\r\n* one error\r\n* multiple errors (though for now we only return the first one)\r\n\r\nSo the question is, in the JS driver, how should the callback be called in each of these cases?"
