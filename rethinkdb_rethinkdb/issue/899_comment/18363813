      "As a node user with little experience in node's db APIs, it was surprising behavior to me. I think you should try to use the err parameter, as it makes it easier to work with promises. I'm not sure if it works well though with the problem of multiple errors.\r\n\r\nIt's not hard to wrap query execution into a custom function that turns all errors into exceptions. Whether this should be included somehow in RethinkDB, it's up to you guys."
