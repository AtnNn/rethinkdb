      "Also, after getting some perspective on this, I agree that checking for errors in two ways is very annoying. I think that in the case of multiple operations (where some may succeed while others may fail) passing an error to the error callback might be problematic. People might check if there is an error and forget that some operations might have succeeded.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure what to do with it. I'd like to look at how other node libraries deal with a similar situation."
