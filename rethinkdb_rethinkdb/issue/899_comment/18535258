      "For the same reason we want all errors to be passed in the callback and not thrown, we should pass an error as soon as there is one.\r\n\r\nIt's a pain if users have to test if the error passed in the callback is defined __and__ if the result passed contains an error.\r\n\r\nBut well, for the time being we could just add some documentation about it."
