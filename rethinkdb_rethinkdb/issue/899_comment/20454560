      "Bump -- It's a pain to write queries with insert/updates with the current API.\r\n\r\nI have to check\r\n- if error is defined\r\n- if result.errors > 0\r\n- Then I can use the returned value (new_val).\r\n\r\nI tend to think that the most common case for write queries are point writes, and in this case our current API is really not nice.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's fine to send back an error and a result. I just don't want to check at two different places if an error occurred. It's the same problem we had when the driver was throwing on a closed connection instead of passing it to the callback."
