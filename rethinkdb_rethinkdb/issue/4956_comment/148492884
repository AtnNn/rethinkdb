      "Thanks for the feedback guys. This isn't very high priority for me either but I feel like it would be nice to bake common use cases like these into the built in sharding system. Then again what's nice about rethink is I have full control over sharding if I want to write my own on top of the API which would also be a good (although more conplex) temporary work around. "
