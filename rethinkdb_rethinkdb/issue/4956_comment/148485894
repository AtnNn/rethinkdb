      "You can accomplish much the same thing (at least for not-too-complicated setups) by creating more shards than you actually need, and then assigning multiple of them to the same machine. `rebalance`ing should treat the shards just like they were on separate machines. More shards does create some more overhead in the Raft system, but for a use-case like you are describing it should not be too bad, and it is at least a work-around available right now."
