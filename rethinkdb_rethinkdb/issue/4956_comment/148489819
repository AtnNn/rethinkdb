      "Baking something like this into our shard-balancing algorithm and the algorithm that assigns shards to servers sounds like an obviously useful feature, for the scenarios you mention.\r\n\r\nI can't promise when we'll get to this since we have quite a list of enhancements and features that we'd love to do at this point, but I like the idea of having a \"weight\" / \"goal load\" factor for each server.\r\n\r\nUntil then, @larkost's work-around is probably the best way to go.\r\nSome secondary-index based range operations can have an increased overhead when there are multiple shards of a table on the same server, but in practice this inefficiency might not matter much, depending on your workload."
