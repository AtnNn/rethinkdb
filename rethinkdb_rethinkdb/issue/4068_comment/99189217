      "@linkyndy The original reason we started discarding \"changes\" that didn't change anything was for consistency with changefeeds and other places. This is probably a question of interpretation. If nothing changes, I wouldn't necessarily expect `return_changes = True` to return anything.\r\n\r\nI can see that it might be annoying having to deal with the absence of the `changes` field in some cases.\r\n\r\n@mlucy @VeXocide What would you think about always including the `changes` field in the result if `return_changes = True`, but leaving it as an empty array if there are no proper changes?"
