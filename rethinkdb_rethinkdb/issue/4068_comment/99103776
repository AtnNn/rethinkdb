      "From my point of view, `True` means that changes will be returned, meaning that `changes` must be present there either way. `False` means that changes will not be returned, so `changes` must not be there either way. I would add an option for the current behavior, which is neither `True`, nor `False`. Because with boolean values, you expect something to be there or not, you expect something certain, while the current behavior is not something certain.\r\n\r\nJust my thoughts on this :)"
