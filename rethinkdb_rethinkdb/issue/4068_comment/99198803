      "@simonratner Makes sense. Well we agree that there should be an option for doing that. :-)\r\nThe only remaining question was how to name the arguments. I still think that setting `return_changes` to `true` not returning non-changes is the right behavior, with the `\"always\"` value to indicate that the document value should always be returned.\r\n\r\nUnless there are objections, I think we should have the empty `changes` array for trivial changes with `return_changes=True` then.\r\nSorry for the late addition to an already settled and implemented proposal..."
