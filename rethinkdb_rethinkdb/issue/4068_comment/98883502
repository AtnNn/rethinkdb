      "> I dislike the combination of 'always', true, and false since it mixes strings and booleans\r\n\r\nThat's true, but I think we shouldn't change it now for the reason you mention. Also most people will only ever use `true` and `false`, while `\"always\"` is a much more specialized option.\r\n\r\nI'm down with `return_changes: 'always'`."
