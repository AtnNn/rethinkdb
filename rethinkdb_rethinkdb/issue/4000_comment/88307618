      "Thank you for the bug report @weijar.\r\nThis seems to be similar to this old issue: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2405\r\n\r\nYou said that starting with `--bind 127.0.0.1` didn't resolve the issue. Did it result in the same error message or a different one?\r\n\r\nPing @Tryneus "
