      "Actually my measurements were with a slightly modified version of the benchmark from https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4569#issue-96898802 that used numeric timestamps and not ReQL time objects in the table. With real time objects, your patch is still much faster though: ~18 seconds instead of ~25 seconds."
