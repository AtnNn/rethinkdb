      "I think we should keep the default. The reason why 8080 is so common and popular is that every expects it for the new software they install. It's nice and predictable. Of course soon enough people end up running stacks of software and want a different port. They can easily change it then with the `--http-port` setting. There is a problem of discovery, but #245 will help with that."
