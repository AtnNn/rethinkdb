      "I'm not sure I understand what we'd lose changing this to a port that doesn't conflict by default with other quite popular tools that are known to use it. \r\n\r\nIANA list is clear about 8080:\r\n\r\n* 8080\tTCP\t\tHTTP alternate (http_alt)\8212commonly used for Web proxy and caching server, or for running a Web server as a non-root user\tOfficial\r\n* 8080\tTCP\t\tApache Tomcat Unofficial\r\n\r\nHere are a few that aren't assigned (officially or unofficially):\r\n\r\n8180\r\n8980\r\n8787\r\n7070\r\n7878\r\n\r\n- - - - -\r\n\r\n_Update_: here's a bit of a context about what led to this issue. Mike tried to run one of the sample apps. By default the dev server for the framework was using port 8080. The app didn't start because the port was already bound. This basically means that for a user whose favorite framework is using port 8080 he'll have to change it (so we'd ask a user to change a port he's used to with his tool because he's also running RethinkDB on the same machine).
