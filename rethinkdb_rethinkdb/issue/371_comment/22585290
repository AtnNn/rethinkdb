      "@flomotlik -- I think we're unlikely to change the default port from 8080. I see how it can be inconvenient, but this is something we hear about from users extremely rarely, which leads me to believe it's a low priority.\r\n\r\nIt is documented quite well in the docs, I think. Could you be a little more specific where else we could document this? (I'd love to add a note if it will make people's lives easier)"
