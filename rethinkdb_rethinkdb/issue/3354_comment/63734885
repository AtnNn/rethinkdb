      "Ah!  I think I see the problem.  `pluck` (along with an unknown number of other terms) makes the assumption that types which are convertible to `DATUM` are trivially convertible to `DATUM`, so it isn't expensive to do the conversion twice.  In those commits I introduced a new type `single_selection_t` which violates this assumption.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to fix it was to restore the assumption.  `get_selection_t` already cached the value of the selection in some circumstances, so I just made it cache in all circumstances, which I think should fix the problem in this particular case.\r\n\r\nI just pushed a branch `mlucy_3354` to `next` that has that patch, if you get a chance to test it before tomorrow.  If that fixes it I'll patch the other `single_selection_t` subclasses too; otherwise we should sit down together tomorrow and see if we can figure out what's actually causing it."
