      "Ok, the workaround to mitigate the impact of this bug has been approved and merged to `next` in commit c16a564, and cherry-picked into `v2.0.x` in commit ad9e0a0.  Review was 3057.  Will be in release 2.0.5.\r\n\r\nThe workaround just filters out entries with unexpected `ai_family` or `ai_addrlen` fields, and prints a warning if an entry is skipped:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInvalid address family returned by `getaddrinfo`, are you using nscd with EGLIBC 2.19?\r\n```\r\nThe linked list returned by `getaddrinfo` still seems to be coherent even if some structures contain junk data.  There is still a small chance (less than 2^16, I believe) that the junk data could correspond to the address family we're looking for and we will accept an incorrect IP address.  Still, this is probably the best we can do if this bug is exhibited.\r\n\r\nThanks for bringing this to our attention, @rotten!"
