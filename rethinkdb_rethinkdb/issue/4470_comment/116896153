      "@rotten Thanks for trying and for the additional information. That's all very odd.\r\nYou said it was working before on 2.0.1 on that server right? Had you also upgraded the kernel or another component at the same time by any chance?\r\n\r\nCould you also post the output of `ifconfig`, or send it via email to daniel@rethinkdb.com (feel free to remove all public addresses from it)?"
