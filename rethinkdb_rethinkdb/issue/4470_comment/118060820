      "Wow, that did it!  Thanks!\r\n\r\nRethinkDB starts just fine when I stop nscd.  I can start it again after rethinkdb is running without apparent ill effect, but if I try to bounce rethinkdb with nscd running, it fails.\r\n\r\neglibc seems to be baked into Ubuntu 14.04 and doesn't be easy to extract or replace.  We'll migrate away from it when the next LTS release comes out (16.04).\r\n\r\nI think that until the nscd or eglibc bug is fixed, we'll take down nscd while restarting rethinkdb.   We don't restart them very often.  I'll hack the start script on our handful of rethinkdb systems  to do it magically.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n"
