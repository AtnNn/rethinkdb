It didn't help.\r\n\r\nI tried commenting out all of the bind= lines in my instance configuration, and then I tried it with the no-default-bind and with that commented out too.  It didn't help.\r\n\r\nSame error with a different family number every time.\r\n\r\n\r\n... I'm still looking at release notes for the packages that were upgrading and comparing this system to the other nodes in the cluster that are working ok (the ones that were successfully upgraded, and the ones that weren't).  Nothing obvious from my perspective yet.\r\n"
