      "This is really strange, for the record.  The involved code hasn't changed between `v2.0.1` and `v2.0.3`, and the only way I can see this error happening is if `getaddrinfo` returns addresses that don't match the address family we explicitly specified (not to mention, I wouldn't be surprised if `23984` is not a valid address family).  This leads me to think there's memory corruption, and that even if we filter by the address family of the results from `getaddrinfo`, something else may still break.\r\n\r\nThat said, the only thing I can think to do from here is check the address family before we construct the `ip_address_t` from the `sockaddr` linked-list returned by `getaddrinfo`.  It still doesn't explain how this is happening, though."
