      "I removed 2.0.3, and installed 2.0.1 back on the system as you suggested.  \r\n\r\nI still get the same error.  I restarted the server (Rackspace Xen instance) before opening the issue to see if that would help.  (It hadn't.)  I tried it again after downgrading to 2.0.1.  \r\n\r\nI also tried moving my entire run/data/log directory out of the way and creating a new one.  It still wouldn't start (same error).\r\n\r\nI do have IPv6 enabled on this server, but I'm not explicitly listening on that interface (except maybe when I do a 'bind=all' - but that didn't change the error anyhow).  I didn't change that when I did the upgrade - it is the same on all my systems.\r\n\r\nlscpu, uname, os-release all look the same as the other two nodes where I successfully upgraded.\r\n\r\n ```  \r\n# lscpu\r\nArchitecture:          x86_64\r\nCPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit\r\nByte Order:            Little Endian\r\nCPU(s):                2\r\nOn-line CPU(s) list:   0,1\r\nThread(s) per core:    1\r\nCore(s) per socket:    1\r\nSocket(s):             2\r\nNUMA node(s):          1\r\nVendor ID:             GenuineIntel\r\nCPU family:            6\r\nModel:                 45\r\nStepping:              7\r\nCPU MHz:               2593.824\r\nBogoMIPS:              5272.92\r\nHypervisor vendor:     Xen\r\nVirtualization type:   full\r\nL1d cache:             32K\r\nL1i cache:             32K\r\nL2 cache:              256K\r\nL3 cache:              20480K\r\nNUMA node0 CPU(s):     0,1\r\n\r\n#  uname -a\r\nLinux myserver 3.13.0-55-generic #94-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 18 00:27:10 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n# cat /etc/os-release \r\nNAME=\"Ubuntu\"\r\nVERSION=\"14.04.2 LTS, Trusty Tahr\"\r\nID=ubuntu\r\nID_LIKE=debian\r\nPRETTY_NAME=\"Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS\"\r\nVERSION_ID=\"14.04\"\r\nHOME_URL=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\"\r\nSUPPORT_URL=\"http://help.ubuntu.com/\"\r\nBUG_REPORT_URL=\"http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that in the morning I might build another copy of this server from an image and see if I can bring it up there.\r\n\r\n"
