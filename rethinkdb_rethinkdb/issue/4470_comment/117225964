      "@rotten Thanks for the additional data. A different address family every time is not expected, that's probably part of the problem.\r\n\r\nSince downgrading didn't help, another potential work-around might be supplying the `--no-default-bind` option (or add a line `no-default-bind` to your instance configuration). In that case RethinkDB will not automatically bind to localhost, but you can still specify interfaces explicitly through the `bind` parameter (including `localhost` if you need to, though I wonder if that's what's triggering the error). Not sure if that helps, but it might be worth a try."
