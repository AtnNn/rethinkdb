      "I ended up removing it from `index_write()`, but kept the `file_account_t` argument to `block_writes()`.\r\nFor block writes, I put an account that's shared between all caches of a table (i.e. hash shards) into the `merger_serializer_t`. Garbage collection still uses its own account for block writes.\r\n\r\nIn CR 2365 by @timmaxw "
