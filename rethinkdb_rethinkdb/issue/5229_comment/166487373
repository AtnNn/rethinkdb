      "@thelinuxlich The metadata overhead proportional to the total data size is now lower (since 2.2). We might indeed need to update that (I'll check the numbers and post the necessary updates here).\r\n\r\nThe constant per-table overhead is still essentially the same. I think it has gone down a bit in 2.2, but it's probably better to be conservative here."
