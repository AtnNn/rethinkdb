        "Most of our tests are small, and one of the nice things about debug mode is that it makes most of the constants in the server (like e.g. the chunk sizes or the garbage collection cutoffs) much smaller.  There's a crashing bug I'm working on now that may or may not be in next that isn't exposed unless garbage collection actually occurs.  (It was only exposed accidentally when I lowered the garbage collection cutoff in release by making a mistake during code-review.)\n\n(To be clear, I'm talking about `datum_t` garbage collection, not block garbage collection.)\n"
