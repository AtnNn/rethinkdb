Proxies don't have any persistent state, and they currently don't have a server name. However most system tables will need a server name. My suggestion is `proxy_<proxy UUID with - replaced by _>`. We can include this name in the `conn.server()` output (#5485) which will also solve #3182 .\r\n* Determine which system tables and administrative commands need to include / be aware of proxies, and then implement it. For obvious reasons, all commands and tables concerned with table configuration should *not* consider proxies. However `stats`, `current_issues` and `jobs` (#5428) most probably should. I think it also makes sense to have proxies in `server_status`, with their `cache_size_mb` field simply being `0`. I'm unsure about whether they should appear in `server_config` or not. I think not, because most of the fields in there don't apply to proxies.\r\n\r\nWe should figure out the naming quickly so we can use it for #5485.\r\n\r\nThe second part is more involved, and can wait for 2.4."
