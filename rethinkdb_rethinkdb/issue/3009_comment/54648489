      "Nice analysis @gchpaco .\r\n\r\n>  I think we can probably stand to round the output of Karney's algorithm to 15 decimal places, in which case this whole problem goes away.\r\n\r\nHow would that make the problem go away?\r\nIt will become less likely, but wouldn't the rounded number still be subject to fluctuation if the result is very close to the rounding boundary?"
