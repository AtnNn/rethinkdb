      "I think we can avoid most issues by marking the geo terms (except `r.point()` and `fill()` possibly) non-deterministic. There is a problem with `sub` though, which is overloaded for polygons. Having to mark `sub` non-deterministic would be silly.\r\n\r\nSwitching to a deterministic floating point library such as MPFR is probably the better solution. It will require migrating secondary indexes at least."
