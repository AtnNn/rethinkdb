      "Note that gcc requires `-msse2` to generate SSE instructions.  In `-m32` with no `-msse2`, it generates `fmull` style instructions, which is the x87 FPU; this is also the default on newton.  In `-m64`, it uses `mulsd` which is the SSE2 instruction and does not exhibit weird behavior.  In `-m32` with SSE2 turned on you get this:\r\n```sh\r\n$ gcc -O0 bar.c -m32 -msse2 -mfpmath=sse && ./a.out\r\n0\r\n```\r\nwhich is the expected behavior.  So we may have an easier time if we force the use of SSE2."
