      "> Well, it would be nice to have an enumeration of what these questions are.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* What ReQL terms do floating point math?\r\n  - Of these, which are we absolutely sure will not cause data divergence even in a weird setup?\r\n  - Of these, which are we reasonably sure will not cause data divergence in a reasonable setup?\r\n  - Which of these could be marked non-deterministic for safety without making common atomic operations impossible?\r\n* What can we do to minimize the chances of data divergence from floating point math?\r\n  - Should RethinkDB be checking the floating point environment at startup to make sure we're using the same rounding modes, have denormalized numbers enabled, etc. etc. ?  (I think the answer is **yes**.)\r\n  - Are there compiler flags we should be using to make sure that all nodes are using the same set of instructions to process floating point numbers?  (I think the answer is **yes**.)\r\n  - Should we be trying to make sure we use the same math libraries on all nodes?  (I don't know.)\r\n  - Should we move to value-replication to make this problem go away?  (I don't know.)\r\n* What happens if there is floating point divergence?\r\n  - Does anything break terribly?\r\n  - Can we make things break less terribly?\r\n  - Do we have tests for what happens when there's data divergence?\r\n* If we don't think we can get rid of floating point divergence, should we document it somewhere?  We'd basically be giving up our consistency guarantee."
