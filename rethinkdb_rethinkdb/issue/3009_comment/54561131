      "I suspect that value-replication will make writes much more expensive in some common cases, such as updating a single field of a large document.\r\n\r\nWhat if we switch to a deterministic numeric type? In the worst case, we could roll our own floats with a `struct { int64_t mantissa; int8_t exponent; }`. Even if it makes numeric operations significantly slower, I think it would be a reasonable solution to the problem.\r\n\r\nThe above proposal might not apply to geo; I'm not familiar enough with the geo code to know. Could we get away with declaring the geo operations non-deterministic?"
