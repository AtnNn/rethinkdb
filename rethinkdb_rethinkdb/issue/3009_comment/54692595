      "Yes, that's true; whatever's causing this error can if you're unlucky bubble up all the way, and perhaps the right answer here is to implement a comparison operator for circles in the test harness that tolerates error.  Since we've already marked the operations as nondeterministic the variance in practice should not be a huge problem (well I suppose if you ask an OS X box to do the computation for you and then ask a Linux box to do the computation for you you'll get divergent answers, but the data between the replicas will never differ)."
