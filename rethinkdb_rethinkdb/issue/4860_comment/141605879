      "I wouldn't say its not idiomatic, but the callback style we have precludes us from simply chaining it onto the connect call, since that means \"once you get the connection do...\" not \"do this with the connection then close it\" \r\n\r\nWe could conceivably add another function to allow this, though it's hard to know when the user is done with the connection with all the callbacks etc"
