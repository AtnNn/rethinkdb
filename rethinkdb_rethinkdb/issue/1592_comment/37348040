      "I just talked to some folks who'd really like this feature, so I wanted to bump it. They want to point their business guys to a UI where they can browse data without having to type queries, but don't want to write their own admin app on top of their application. Having a data browser would be important for them (since writing admin tools takes time).\r\n\r\nI told them about Chateau (https://github.com/neumino/chateau) and that made them happy, but they'd want this type of functionality to come out of the box."
