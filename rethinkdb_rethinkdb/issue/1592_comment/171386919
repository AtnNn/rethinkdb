      "@ChrisCates: the web UI is a fairly involved Backbone project, and it would be unlikely that we would want to abruptly change the web UI to run on Angular / React. Rewriting the entire UI would be a very involved project (it took multiple people months to build it.)\r\n\r\nI'd suggest limiting scope and writing an external admin tool to work with RethinkDB to solve the immediate use case you describe. The web UI can follow an upgrade path down the road."
