      "For now what's planned is:\r\n- A list of table through an HTML select list -- I would rather have a plain list of table, but that's a detail.\r\n- You pick a table, and you get all the rows ordered by your primary key.\r\n- Results are paginated.\r\n\r\nFor later but have a decent change to make it for 1.11\r\n- You can order by field (if you have too many documents, you need an index\r\n\r\nFor a more distant future probably post 1.11\r\n- You can update/delete a document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wasn't there when you were discussing with @mglukhovsky, so I'm not sure that I know what you are talking about.\r\nI just heard about a tool to click a few buttons to build a query. Is that what you would like to have?\r\n\r\nI'll make sure to ping you once I have a decent prototype so we can discuss that with @mglukhovsky and @coffeemug."
