      "I'd kind of like a way to be more involved in the process of this features design. I really liked the way we got opinions from everyone about ReQL features and I think it helped us get a good result faster. Both @mlucy and I had some pretty strong thoughts about how this feature should be designed and I even submitted some design sketches. Could you post the design sketches you used for this feature and discuss the major decisions for the project, which decisions you made and why?"
