      "Wouldn't the web UI only support very basic insert(), update() and delete() statements (i.e. without any complex filtering, ...)? At least that seems to be the case with other DBMS' graphical UIs. These simple statements can be written rather easily in the Data Explorer (and re-used thanks to the history).\r\n\r\nFor me a bit of \"history management\" would suffice:\r\n* mark a query in the hostory as \"keeper\"\r\n* being able to give a name to those queries\r\n* empty the history but keep the \"keepers\""
