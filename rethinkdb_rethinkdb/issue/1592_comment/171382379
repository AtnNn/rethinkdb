      "I'm at a cross roads here.\r\n\r\nImprove Chateau and do PRs on that project (and rebrand as RDBMyAdmin since I always spell Chateau wrong - Not french :joy:)\r\n\r\nOr, upgrade the Rethink Admin panel and directly do PRs to the admin panel with a Data Explorer.\r\n\r\nI feel there are a few problems with the current Rethink Admin Panel:\r\n\r\n- The server polls for  changes with `/?conn_id=[ID]` *Solution: upgrade to a websocket*\r\n- Create a basic CRUD system for Tables and Databases in the Data Explorer tab. Support nested arrays/objects w/CRUD (already been discussed here)\r\n- Facilitate logs of all queries that have been ran on the instance. This should be for **development** only.\r\n\r\n"
