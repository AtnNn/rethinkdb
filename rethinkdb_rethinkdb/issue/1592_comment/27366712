      "Also I should be able to merge profiling support either today or tomorrow and I was hoping to start working with Michel on the UI for that so I'm not sure about scheduling this for 1.11. I kind of think we could get a lot more attention for the 1.11 release if we have a working UI for the profiler that people can play with. And if we announce the profiler support in 1.11 and then later announce a UI for it it's probably not going to make as big an impression. Would people be strongly opposed to focusing on that for 1.11 and moving this to 1.12?"
