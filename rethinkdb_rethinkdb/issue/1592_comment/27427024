      "I feel like I'm suffering from not being there when this feature was first discussed because I'm having a lot of trouble seeing the vision for this from your description. A lot of the features you're describing sound cool but it seems like all of them would work really well as additions to the data explorer rather than a separate entity. And having both features in the UI seems like it's going to make things a lot less clear to me. If the thing we're adding is going to be in the Explore sub tab under the Data tab and the thing we have now is called the Data Explorer it really seems like this is going to get confusing. I think I'm just going to come and talk to you in person because I feel like I'm missing something in these textual descriptions."
