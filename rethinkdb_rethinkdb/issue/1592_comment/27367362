      "Actually another idea is to leave the Data Explorer as is and put this view in the individual views for each table. I think that might actually lead to the clearest understanding in people's heads. It avoids having 2 layers of tabs which seems kind of dicey to me and it cements the table view as the one stop place to find out everything about this table. If I imagine myself as an Ops guy trying to configure a table. I could easily see myself wondering something like:  \"Hmm, should this table be set to soft durability by default?\" or \"How many shards should I make of this table.\" And it would be really nice to be able to check things like how big the documents are or whether the data looks like it needs to be stored in hard durability. It's mostly just nice for sanity checking that this table does indeed contain what you think it does. I actually really like the idea of putting this feature there."
