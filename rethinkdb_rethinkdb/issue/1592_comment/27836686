      "Calling the section \"Query\" is odd.  I realize you meant it as a verb, but I read it as a noun.  I would expect that to take me to a place where I can see queries that have been run on the database, the same way \"Data\" takes me to a place where I can see data that's been inserted into the database.\r\n\r\nI would suggest changing the name, possibly to something more explicit like \"Run Queries\".\r\n\r\nAlso, it's weird that we now have both a \"Tables\" tab and a \"Data\" tab.  I have no intuition about what information goes in which.  (I'm guessing that table metadata goes in \"tables\" and table content goes in \"Data\".)  I would either rename one of them or merge the two."
