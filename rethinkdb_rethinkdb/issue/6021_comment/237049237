      "Is the key idea that the IDs will be sorted by time (approximately)?\r\n\r\nLike with other time-based primary keys in RethinkDB, it will be problematic with our current sharding scheme, because new documents always end up in the last shard until you rebalance the table.\r\nI think it will be more useful as a built-in feature after we add https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4237 .\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/117\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5231"
