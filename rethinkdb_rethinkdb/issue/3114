        "There is no rhyme or reason to the argument ordering for `rcheck` or `rfail` macros.  To illustrate, from `src/rdb_protocol/error.hpp` currently:\r\n```c++\r\n#define rcheck(pred, type, msg) rcheck_target(this, type, pred, msg)\r\n```\r\n(note that `type` and `pred` have switched position)\r\n\r\nAlso the `rfail` macros implicitly call `strprintf` with vararg macros and the `rcheck` macros don't.  If, as I believe is the case, all `rcheck` macros call `strprintf` themselves, we should also be consistent about this.\r\n\r\nThis is a persistent vicious nuisance that bites me about once a week but hasn't been \"serious enough\" to merit fixing."
