      "One issue with your first option is that currently we expose these pseudo-tables through the same interface as real tables; i.e. `r.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"table_config\")`. If we instead introduce a new method for getting the pseudo-table, then we lose some generality. For example, if we eventually introduce a way to access tables through HTTP, then the current system will expose the pseudo-tables too with no additional overhead. We could consider alternatives like `r.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"table_config_<db>\")` or `r.db(\"<db>\").table(\"$reql_table_config$\")`. (But if we do the latter, then we still have to have a `r.db(\"rethinkdb\")` because there are other pseudo-tables like `server_status`.)"
