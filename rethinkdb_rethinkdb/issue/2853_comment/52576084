      "Instead of having a `directors` field with a list of directors, we should just have a `director` field with the director. This is simpler and less likely to confuse people; and the reduction in functionality is minimal. The original reason for allowing a list of directors was to support auto-failover later, but I think that's a bad way to do auto-failover. The server lists in `table_config` are supposed to describe the short-term objectives of the cluster, not the contingency plans."
