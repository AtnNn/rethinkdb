      "By the way, the possible values of the `role` field in `table_status` are currently `nothing`, `director` and `replica`. Possible values of `status` are:\r\n* `ready`\r\n* `missing` (server not connected)\r\n* `backfill_data`\r\n* `transitioning` (catchall term for conditions that should never last more than about a second)\r\n* `offload_data` and `erase_data` (used when a server has just switched to role `nothing`)\r\n* `need_director`\r\n\r\nIf `role` is `nothing` and `status` would be `ready`, then the server is omitted from the list.\r\n\r\nWe should try to think of a better term than `offload_data` for a server that's only holding onto its copy of the data in case someone needs to backfill from it."
