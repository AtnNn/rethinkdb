      "(From a comment on code review 1893):\r\n\r\nI think the strings for the roles should be tweaked a bit:\r\n\r\nIndicate that these are temporary states, and match the tense of other states (e.g. `transitioning`):\r\n* `backfill_data` -> `backfilling_data`\r\n* `offload_data` -> `offloading_data`\r\n* `erase_data` -> `erasing_data`\r\n\r\n`need_director` is a little strange, it doesn't give the user much indication of what is going on.  As well to match tense, I would suggest `waiting_for_director` or `looking_for_director`."
