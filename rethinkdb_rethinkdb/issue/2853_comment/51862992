      "* For `table_config`, we should consider unifying `replicas` and `directors` into a single list of machines; machines earlier in the list will be preferred for directorship. The only thing this loses is that the user can no longer indicate that a certain machine should never become director even if no other is available. I don't think that's a very important feature.\r\n\r\n* Consider the following alternative format for `table_config`:\r\n    ```python\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"db_name.table_name\"  # this is the primary key\r\n        \"uuid\": \"12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab\",\r\n        \"servers\": [\r\n            [\"shard_1_server_1_name\", \"shard_1_server_2_name\"],\r\n            [\"shard_2_server_1_name\", \"shard_2_server_2_name\"]\r\n        ],\r\n        \"split_points\": [\"<split_point_between_shards_1_and_2>\"]\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    This is nice because it separates the servers from the split points. I suspect that people will often want to change the servers without changing the split points."
