      "@danielmewes -- that is in fact how it's implemented, and as far as I can tell there's no reason not to use the algorithm you described instead.  (The reason we implemented it the way we did is that we originally assumed users would mostly be sampling arrays rather than whole tables, and at the time `shards.cc` didn't exist yet so implementing it efficiently for the sharded case would have been about twice as much work.)"
