      "> Add an optarg `distribution=\"uniform\"` (or similar) to make `r.sample` switch over to its current implementation that guarantees a strictly uniform sampling\r\n\r\nI don't think we should do this part until we get subtree counts. For now it would be a vanity option, as it's basically unusable because of speed. I think people will try to use the option, discover that it's super-slow, and submit bug reports without ever ending up using it. It seems strictly better to avoid this option, until we can actually make it be fast."
