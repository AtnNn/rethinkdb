      "> Yet another option would be to introduce an approximate `sample` operation.\r\n\r\nI always thought that our adherence to strict uniform distribution in `sample` is an example of excessive purity. At the moment `sample` is unusable in 90% of use cases due to performance issues, and making it return a random sample without precisely specifying the distribution would be relatively easy to do and would suffice for 90% of cases where people want to use the command.\r\n\r\nI'm extremely strongly in favor of making `sample` approximate by default. My guess is that if we do and document it clearly, the question of having a strictly uniform `sample` function will not come up with actual users for a long, long time."
