      "As a bit more information, I'm running a single shard locally and `r.table('example').sample(1).run(conn)` in the python library takes 60s to complete on a table of about 200k rows, so it might not be the cost of pulling data from one shard to another. The frontend shows this as ~6k/s reads, so I'll have to do a bit more investigation to see if this is rethinkdb or the python lib that's causing the issue."
