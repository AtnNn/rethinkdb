      "Yet another option would be to introduce an approximate `sample` operation.\r\n\r\nWe could use the approximate distribution query to reduce the key space that we need to traverse to a small fraction in a way that's approximately uniform with the key distribution.\r\n\r\nWhile this will be somewhat off from an actual uniform sampling, I think it's going to be enough for 75% or so of all use cases.\r\n\r\nI think we should even consider making the approximate `sample` operation the default, and requiring an optarg (e.g. `distribution=\"uniform\"` or `uniform=true`) to get the current behavior for cases that rely on a proper uniform distribution."
