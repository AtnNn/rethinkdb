      "@danielmewes FYI, the results are certainly less pronounced when running against a single shard:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable.sample(1) 320ms server time\r\ntable.sum('field') 200ms server time\r\ntable.avg('field') 202ms server time\r\ntable.count() (38717 rows) 23ms server time\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso note that `table.sample(n)` takes roughly the same amount of time regardless of the value `n` (including the special case where `n` >= total number of rows)."
