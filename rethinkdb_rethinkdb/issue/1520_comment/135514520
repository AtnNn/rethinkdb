      "Yeah the profiler doesn't work too well for some queries. I wouldn't rely on the timings it gives you for this to be honest.\r\n\r\nThe remaining difference between `map.count` and `sample` is likely because of our inefficient `sample` implementation that was mentioned before, which concentrates all documents on a single thread. `map.count` on the other hand performs the count on multiple threads in parallel, and then just adds up the subresults."
