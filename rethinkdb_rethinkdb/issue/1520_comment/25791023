      "I don't remember the details of the `sample` implementation, so I might be wrong on this (@jdoliner should chime in because he knows it much more intimately). As far as I remember, `sample` was designed to return a uniform distribution, and doing this right is surprisingly tricky. We picked a simpler implementation that does a linear time shuffle, with the intention of doing a smarter implementation later.\r\n\r\nSorry you're running into this -- we're exclusively working on performance now, and most issues should be ironed out in the next few months. Thank you so much for reporting the bugs and being patient!\r\n\r\n"
