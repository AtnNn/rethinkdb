      "Also I think \"For now it would be a vanity option, as it's basically unusable because of speed\" is an exaggeration. It's strictly more usable than a non-indexed `orderBy` for example.\r\n\r\nThe main problem with the current implementation is that all the work is done on a single thread, rather than working on the shards. So it has limited parallelism, but its runtime complexity is still only linear, and it only uses constant memory no matter the data size."
