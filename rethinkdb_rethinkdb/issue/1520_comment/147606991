      "There's actually another aspect to this that I hadn't thought of earlier.\r\nOnce we implement subtree counts (compare https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3949 ), we can actually do `table.sample(n)` in `O(n log N)` time, where N is the size of the table.\r\n\r\nWhile we can implement the short-term improvement described in this issue to reduce the runtime by some factor, it will still be a linear-time `O(N)` operation.\r\n\r\nThe short-term improvements are not too hard I think, but still require a fair bit of work which might be better spent on getting #3949 done more quickly, at which point we could implement a truly fast `sample` operation.\r\n\r\nI'll think about how to prioritize these..."
