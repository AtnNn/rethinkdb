        "I'm using rethinkdb 2.2.0 JS driver from `npm`. At times, I'm getting this during execution in strict mode:\r\n```\r\nUnhandled promise rejection TypeError: 'caller', 'callee', and 'arguments' properties may not be accessed on strict mode functions or the arguments objects for calls to them\r\n```\r\nCoffeeScript seems to have resolved the issue here some time ago (https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/issues/1547), so the only reason why the code might still be non-compliant is if the person who is submitting the compiled version to `npm` is using an outdated version of CoffeeScript to compile the code. \r\n\r\nWould you kindly fix the `npm` version? Thanks!"
