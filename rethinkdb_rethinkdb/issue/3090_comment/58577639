      "Hi @danielmewes \r\nI know the \"buggy client\" is a different issue and it doesn't bother me right now. for now i will be happy loading the first set of data. \r\nAnswering your questions: i have only 1 database with 1 table (the one i'm trying to load) it's configured with replica count = 2, ack = 2 and shards = 2. I create the database and import a small subset of data like 40k docs to allow a balanced sharding (our data already have uuids as keys so i use them). after replica and sharding is configured i delete those documents and start the full import process. \r\nServers are two old hp DL320 2 procs 2 GB ram and 120GB ssd running Ubuntu 14.04 with nothing else. cache is configured with 512MB and no other configuration is modified.\r\nAs i previously commented when i've started the test rethinkdb was 1.13 (i guess) and with a smaller sample of data i get the corruption errors not while importing but when querying the database. with version 1.14.1 I tried the same sample of data and worked ok so i tried to upload the whole dataset and started to have the disconnection issues and the seg fault. \r\nthen with 1.15.0 and 1.15.1 i still have the disconnections, i don't see the seg fault but importing client hangs for ever. \r\nanyway i'm re importing data (as we speak) running (rethinkdb import) in one server but pointing to the other one. (just to see if client is leaking memory or the server part that talk with clients is) \r\nI can't send you data (at least right now) because is not ours it's from several different parties (8 at least) and is very sensitive: traceability information of oncology and aids drugs) , but i can compile head version and increase logging verbosity even adding logs through the code, to help you identify the issue. \r\nI will let you know the result of the test i'm running now. and will see how to continue then.\r\nRegards.\r\nMarcelo\r\n"
