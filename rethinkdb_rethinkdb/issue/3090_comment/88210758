      "@gato Thanks a lot. I really appreciate you took the time to re-try this.\r\n\r\nAt this point we might have to conclude that 2 GB of RAM (is that still the hardware you're using?) isn't enough for importing this data set with the default configuration at the moment (we should look into that more though).\r\n\r\nTo get past the import stage, you can run `rethinkdb import` with the `--clients 1` parameter. That reduces the number of concurrently inserting connections from the default of 8 to a single one, which I expect will reduce the peak memory consumption during import.\r\n\r\n"
