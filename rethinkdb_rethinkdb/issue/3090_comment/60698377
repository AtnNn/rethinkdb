      "I cannot quite reproduce the observerd increase in memory usage by running a `filter().count()` repeatedly (kept it running for a few days).\r\n\r\n@gato did you ever send us your data? That would help us to reproduce the issue. Also an example for the filter conditions that you've been using for testing would be useful.\r\n@mglukhovsky can you get things set up for @gato to upload his data file?"
