      "I have been trying reproducing this with data derived from the sample document @gato kindly provided for us.\r\n\r\nUsing a cache size of 512 MB, these are the memory usage numbers I'm getting:\r\n- after inserting 20M documents: 2,107 MB (RES)\r\n- restarting RethinkDB afterwards (I wanted to see if this would change the memory used): 954 MB\r\n- after running two types of count queries (one filtered on `serie` with about 200 matches and one over all documents): 1,619 MB\r\n- after repeatedly running these queries for about 20 hours: 1,581 MB\r\n\r\nIt seems I cannot quite reproduce the growing memory consumption from running the count queries. In this test memory usage actually slightly increased over time, but that's probably just a measurement artifact (I might have measured at different times during query execution).\r\n\r\nOne thing that definitely requires more investigation is why the memory consumption was about 500 MB higher after inserting the documents, compared to when I later ran the queries after a restart. I will look into that next."
