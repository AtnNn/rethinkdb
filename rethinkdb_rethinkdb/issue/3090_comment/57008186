      "Hi @gato -- sorry you're running into this. We'll look into the issues and fix them ASAP. The best way to proceed is to work with @mglukhovsky do get us the data and have us replicate the issue internally. Unfortunately with heartbeat timeouts there isn't very much additional logging we can do to get to the root of the problem, so we have to work to replicate it internally."
