      "Hi @danielmewes,\r\nYes I've tried, after hitting some out of disk errors (my fault) I was able to load the data using --clients 1 although it was painfully slow (like 3 and 1/2 days).\r\nAt the end of the import process some swapping had occurred like 350 ~ 400 MB swap in one node and a little less in the other.\r\nAfter that, I've tried a simple count query (which i knew had to traverse the whole dataset) and the server started to swap like crazy, heartbeat between the nodes failed and query hung. \r\nI haven't done anything after that.\r\nSorry.\r\nMarcelo"
