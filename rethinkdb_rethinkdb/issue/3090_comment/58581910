      "Thank you @gato for the clarification.\r\n\r\nSo I think this is essentially an issue of memory consumption and RethinkDB going into swap as a consequence at this point.\r\nFor now, is there an option for you to get more memory for the machines @gato ?\r\nAnother option could be to reduce the number of concurrent clients that `rethinkdb import` uses. That should also reduce memory consumption on the server. The command line argument for that is `rethinkdb import --clients NUM_CLIENTS`. I suggest trying 1-4 clients.\r\n\r\nWe will test this more and investigate how to reduce our memory footprint once https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2988 is fixed (since these could actually be the same bugs, or at least be related)."
