      "Hi @danielmewes \r\nI'm almost sure now that 2GB isn't enough but those are old servers and it has no point buying memory for them anyway.\r\nSo, don't waste much time chasing this issue, as this is some edge situation (lots of data in old & small hardware). Feel free to close the issue or move it to the end of your backlog.\r\nThanks for your support \r\nMarcelo\r\n"
