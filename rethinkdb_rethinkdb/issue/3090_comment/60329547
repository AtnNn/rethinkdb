      "Regarding the timeout in the import script:\r\nYou can try modifying the script. Is is usually installed to /usr/local/lib/python*/site-packages/rethinkdb I think. Open the file _import.py in there and look for all occurances of `r.connect(host, port, auth_key=auth_key)`.\r\nAdd the optional argument `r.connect(host, port, auth_key=auth_key, timeout=180)` to each of them."
