      "@gato Thanks for the info. Sorry this isn't working. I know you must have spent a lot of time on this.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like the 2 GB servers aren't enough for this.\r\n\r\nI'll try again to reproduce this and will run some memory profiling, but I'm not sure how quickly we can bring the memory usage down enough for making this work.\r\n\r\nFor now the only option seems to be bigger servers unfortunately."
