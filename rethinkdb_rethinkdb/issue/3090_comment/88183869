      "Hi @danielmewes,\r\nI've finally got the time to run the tests again, but i'm afraid i have to tell you that server started to swap memory early and the import process hung 15 hs later, having completed ~76% of the original data set (16M of 21M docs)  with one server swapping 1.5 GB (the one that also has the import client running) and ~330MB of swap the other one.\r\nversion tested was 1.16.3~0trusty (GCC 4.8.2) \r\nnone other process were running in those servers.\r\nRegards.\r\nMarcelo"
