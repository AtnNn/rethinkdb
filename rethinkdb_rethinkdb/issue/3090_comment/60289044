      "Hi!\r\nI've done the test described before and the import process run for a longer period of time but failed the same way (although much more data were imported ~20M docs from 21M+) \r\nI've restarted both processes and memory went back to normal. \r\nSo i've used this almost complete set to run a couple of query test (all \"filter({simple condition}).count().run()' like)  in a loop, as none of them were using indexes every one of them take around 34 minutes to complete (which is fine for me). And after around 12 or 13 hours of running almost all swap where consumed. \r\nI've built the database from repository with debug code and started it with valgrind but the server is so slow running with valgrind that \"rethinkdb import\" aborts with \"Connection error during 'table check': timed out\" also valgrind complains a lot  about \"Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value at...\" and \"Use of uninitialised value of size 8 at ...\"\r\nDo you have a way to profile or log memory usage that i can use to help in solving this issue? do you use gperf instead of valgrind? are any ./configure's or make's parameters that i need to set up to run this test?\r\nThanks.\r\nMarcelo"
