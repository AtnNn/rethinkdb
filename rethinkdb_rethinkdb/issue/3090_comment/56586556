      "Thanks @gato for reporting this, and sorry you ran into this.\r\n\r\nWhat version of RethinkDB were you running at that time?\r\n\r\n@danielmewes fixed something that could have lead to such crash. See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2410\r\nThe fix was shipped in RethinkDB 1.13.4 and 1.14.\r\n\r\nIf you were running a more recent version of RethinkDB, we should re-open the bug and try to track it down again.\r\n"
