      "Hi @danielmewes \r\nAbout memory consumption when running queries maybe is something particular of my current installation.\r\nRemember that I was importing the whole set of data when big swap use and hearthbeat issues showed and the import process was force terminated. then i re started the servers and run the tests with the imported data which may have some degree of corruption. not data issues are shown on logs, but i don't know for sure. \r\nPerhaps fixing the memory issue in the import process will allow me to import the whole dataset without issues and the query issues fixes too. \r\n\r\n"
