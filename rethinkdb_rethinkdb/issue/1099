        "``` javascript\nr.expr('hello, world and universe').tokenize(' ', ',')\n// returns ['hello', 'world', 'and', 'universe']\n```\n\nThe use case for this is as follows. If the new `.group` proposal passes review, it will make map/reduce functionality incredibly accessible and it's very much worth marketing and writing about. A common hello world map/reduce example is to count the frequency of words in documents, which requires tokenization. We could do it with javascript, but it would make for a much less friendly example. Hence, `r.tokenize` would be extremely nice to have.\n"
