      "As regards...\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.using({ db: 'marvel' }, (r) => {\r\n  // connection is created and internally bound to new instance of `r`,\r\n  // allowing you to call `.run()` with no argument\r\n  return r.table('dc').toArray()\r\n})\r\n.then((results) => console.log(results))\r\n```\r\n\r\n...I think it would be a mistake to require a database parameter every time, as it's another thing to forget and manage, not unlike the original problem. \r\n\r\nAm I the only one for whom the database identifier is something I basically specify once for my whole application? Seems ideological to require it to be specified for every single query. \r\n\r\nI can't currently see how the ```using(...)``` syntax suggested could have this problem baked out of it."
