      "@bchociej \r\n\r\n> I really enjoy that the \"query building\" portion of the API can be used without a database connection\r\n\r\nAbsolutely this capability should be there, but not surfaced by default (e.g. reference examples could demonstrate the simpler, less-error-prone form). \r\n\r\nIf there isn't an expectation to change the canonical tutorial form, then there isn't a huge benefit to iterating the API, as by the time you've figured out how much of a pain it is, you've either given up or built your own wrapper function. \r\n\r\nIdeally people wouldn't all have to independently realise it's a pain to add (and sometimes forget) this boilerplate for literally every query, because the core API's canonical model of use has designed-out the possibility of making the error."
