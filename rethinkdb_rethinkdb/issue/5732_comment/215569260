      "In defense of the existing way: I really enjoy that the \"query building\" portion of the API can be used without a database connection; this is fantastic for unit testing\r\n\r\nEdit: I'm not saying other paradigms *shouldn't* be supported, just that I really like the existing paradigm for certain use cases. I am absolutely in favor of more Promise support, for example."
