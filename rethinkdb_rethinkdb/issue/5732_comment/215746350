      "@danielmewes -- the idea is that if you return a query inside a promise chain, it's automatically ran as most of the time you don't have any reasons for not running your query and returning it* It also let you run a query by doing `yield query` instead of `yield query.run()`\r\n\r\nIt's technically done by just adding `then = function() { return this.run(conn }`. Same for `error` and `catch`. The only thing is that you need to sort out what is `conn`.\r\n\r\n*Rethinkdbdash is doing this by default, but some found this behavior annoying enough in some cases that there's an option to turn it off. See: https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash/issues/128"
