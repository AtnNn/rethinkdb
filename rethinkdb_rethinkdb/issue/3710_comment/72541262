      "I think that `YYYY-MM-DD` is an easy enough format string to remember. The problem that I usually have with date format strings is that they look like `%Y-%m-%d`, not to be confused with `%y-%m-%d`, `%Y-%M-%d`, or `%Y-%m-%D`, all of which are valid format strings that do different things. If we design our format syntax so that `YYYY-MM-DD` literally works and does what it looks like, I think it would be OK."
