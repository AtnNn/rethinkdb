      "I *really* like the `format` command.\r\n\r\nOne concern I have with it is that whenever I format things like this I always find myself digging through documentation to find a correct string to represent what I want, which always annoys me. It doesn't seem very... conducive to quick and dirty time series grouping queries, though it might be a matter of good docs. "
