      "> @coffeemug: One concern I have with it is that whenever I format things like this I always find myself digging through documentation to find a correct string to represent what I want, which always annoys me.\r\n\r\nAgreed, I think one solution would be to allow passing a \"human-readable\" unit (i.e. `year`, `month`, `day`, etc) which would give you an ISO 8601 formatted date up to and including the unit specified.\r\n\r\nSo `.format('day')` would just be an alias to `.format('YYYY-MM-DD')`."
