        "User hubz on IRC was testing a scenario with a `get_all` that was fetching 1 million different keys at once. Something similar to\n\n```\nr.table(\"t\").get_all(key1, key2, ..., key1000000)\n```\n\nWhile this is a little extreme, wanting to fetch something like a few thousand keys at once is certainly not unreasonable.\n\nWe should test that this works and doesn't run out of memory or anything like that.\n\nI also suspect that this will be very slow at the moment, since as far as I know `get_all` is going to fetch one key at a time. We should consider parallelizing it (I vaguely remember that it's using `union` underneath?).\n"
