      "I'm of the opinion that we should never expose UUIDs under any circumstances if at all possible. In my experience (both as a user, and as an observer of other users) they make for a terrible user experience because the user doesn't set them, can't remember them, and can't easily refer to objects by them, either manually or programmatically (manually because they're hard to remember and copy pasting is very annoying, programmatically because they're forced to list UUIDs in their scripts which is an indirection step).\r\n\r\nSo I'm extremely strong in favor of never exposing them if at all possible, unless there is a really, *really* compelling reason to do it."
