      "The argument for exposing UUIDs in some form is to make it easier to write third-party tools that work correctly even if tables and servers get renamed.\r\n\r\nThe argument for using UUIDs as the primary key is 1) translating between names and UUIDs takes effort to implement and is bug-prone; 2) users may think it's weird if we use something mutable as the primary key.\r\n\r\nI don't think either of these arguments are \"really, *really* compelling\".\r\n\r\n/cc @mlucy. I think you had comments on this."
