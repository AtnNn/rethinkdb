      "Currently we don't allow renaming servers that aren't connected to the cluster. (There isn't any compelling reason for this; I originally made the change because I think we're going to move in that direction in the long term, but we could definitely change it back.) However, this means that name conflict resolution doesn't work if there are two missing servers with the same name. This is a problem for the `rethinkdb.table_status` table (#2923), which is supposed to show all servers, including disconnected ones."
