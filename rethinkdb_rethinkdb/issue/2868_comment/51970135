      "The uuid of a table never change, but the name can.\r\nIn case of conflicts, a table can be renamed, and you may not want an operation for table `foo` to be executed on another table because your table was renamed `foo_renamed`.\r\n\r\nThis kind of things has more chance to happen on the web interface where the data displayed can be a few seconds late.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an edge case though, and I also share @coffeemug opinion on not showing uuids."
