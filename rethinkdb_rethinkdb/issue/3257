        "Currently it looks like this:\n\n``` python\n{'critical': False,\n 'description': \"Server '__deleted_server__' was declared dead, but is still connected to these servers: '__deleted_server__', 'PrinceHamlet'.\",\n 'id': 'b0c970d0-c0f7-577a-b7a3-feb5687694b0',\n 'info': {'affected_server_ids': ['dc264636-7e16-486c-8434-7b520f2c253a',\n                                  'a966e087-c663-4cd0-8c1d-c37af841c1e3'],\n          'affected_servers': ['__deleted_server__', 'PrinceHamlet'],\n          'server': '__deleted_server__',\n          'server_id': 'dc264636-7e16-486c-8434-7b520f2c253a'},\n 'type': 'server_ghost'}\n```\n- Maybe we shouldn't include reports from permanently removed servers when compiling issues; note that the permanently removed server is complaining that it can see itself. On the other hand, if the user starts a permanently removed server alone, they should still see an issue, even if no other server sees that server.\n- We should just say `A server` instead of `Server '__deleted_server__'`\n- We should omit the `info.server` field, which will always be `'__deleted_server__'`.\n"
