      "Hmm this is actually less trivial than I had thought. The group by term creates a grouped map reduce term which creates a pluck term which handles the path specification.\r\nNow we would somehow have to find out what the original user-issued term was. Going to check with @mlucy whether there is a way...\r\n\r\nIf it is complicated, I suggest that we either leave this open for later or (temporarily) remove the \"to pluck\" part of the error message altogether."
