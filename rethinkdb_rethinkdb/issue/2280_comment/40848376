      "If you can prioritize this, that would be great (it shouldn't be too long). Otherwise, I'm breaking features due to the internal representation changes (and now it's harder to parse), and so I'll have to pin the rethinkdb gem to an older version.\r\n\r\nI'm getting some other index test issues running on rethinkdb next such as:\r\n\r\n![screenshot77](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/297060/2746304/7cf89d74-c744-11e3-9a32-ae4be54bf8a3.png)\r\n\r\nIf you add the db/table names in the error messages, I'll be able to keep up with your next branch, which will make a smoother experience for my users (and yours)."
