      "I agree that the current field names are really confusing.\r\nI also like @chipotle's suggestion of renaming `affected_servers` to `reporting_servers`, assuming that also makes sense for the other issue types (*Edit*: Seems like `affected_servers` is specific to the server disconnected issue).\r\n\r\nThe `server` field for this issue should probably be called `inaccessible_server`?\r\n\r\nPinging @Tryneus @timmaxw "
