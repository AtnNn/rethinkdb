        "I have three empty rethinkdb servers.\r\n\r\n1. Start server 1 \r\n2. Start server 2 connect to cluster port of 1.\r\n3. Web UI reports 2/2 servers\r\n4. Start server 3 connect to cluster port of 1.\r\n5. Web UI reports 2/2 servers.\r\n6. Server 3 log reports it is connect to 1.\r\n7. Server 1 log does not report connection.\r\n\r\nTo further investigate the behaviour of the cluster i tried the following.\r\n\r\n8. Take server 3 offline. Web UI reports no change.\r\n9. Take server 2 offline. Web UI reports warning that server is missing.\r\n10. Take server 3 ( !! ) online. Web UI reports again two of two servers online.\r\n11. Take server 3 offline. Web UI reports warning that server is missing.\r\n12. Take server 2 online. Web UI reports again two of two servers online.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what exactly is going on here. \r\nSomehow server 2 and server 3 are seen as the same rethinkdb server. Is this a bug or a configuration issue ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance !\r\n\r\nJE"
