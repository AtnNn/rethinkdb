        "I have three empty rethinkdb servers.\n1. Start server 1 \n2. Start server 2 connect to cluster port of 1.\n3. Web UI reports 2/2 servers\n4. Start server 3 connect to cluster port of 1.\n5. Web UI reports 2/2 servers.\n6. Server 3 log reports it is connect to 1.\n7. Server 1 log does not report connection.\n\nTo further investigate the behaviour of the cluster i tried the following.\n1. Take server 3 offline. Web UI reports no change.\n2. Take server 2 offline. Web UI reports warning that server is missing.\n3. Take server 3 ( !! ) online. Web UI reports again two of two servers online.\n4. Take server 3 offline. Web UI reports warning that server is missing.\n5. Take server 2 online. Web UI reports again two of two servers online.\n\nI am not sure what exactly is going on here. \nSomehow server 2 and server 3 are seen as the same rethinkdb server. Is this a bug or a configuration issue ?\n\nThanks in advance !\n\nJE\n"
