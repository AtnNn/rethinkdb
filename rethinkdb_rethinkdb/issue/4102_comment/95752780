      "Hi @shastingspod, at the moment establishing full connectivity between allservers is the only way I can think of to do this (@timmaxw any other ideas?).\r\n\r\nWe're currently working on a new clustering subsystem that will allow configuring and replicating tables while some servers are absent (this will ship with RethinkDB 2.2). However it will still require direct connectivity between the backfill sender and backfill receiver.\r\nIf you make sure that the primaries for all tables in the blue cluster are on server A, and you add a new replica for these tables on server 1 in the green cluster, the red connection between servers A and 1 might be sufficient (@timmaxw do you think this would work?). However this isn't really a supported configuration. RethinkDB isn't specifically build to deal with non-transitive connectivity like in this case.\r\n"
