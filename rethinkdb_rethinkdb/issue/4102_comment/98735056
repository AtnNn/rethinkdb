      "Thanks for your help @danielmewes.  I've been looking over the issues, I see #3151 and #3158 which will encrypt intracluster communications.  Will this feature automatically create encrypted connections to all existing nodes when new nodes are added?  That would effectively solve our problem. Is this feature scheduled in any near-future releases?"
