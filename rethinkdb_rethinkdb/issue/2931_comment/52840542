We have the following behavior in each driver:\r\n\r\nRuby - no error, strings are converted to the Binary pseudotype by default\r\nPython - `Cannot convert a unicode string to binary, use 'unicode.encode()' to specify the encoding.`\r\nJavascript - `Parameter to 'r.binary' must be a Buffer object or RQL query.`"
