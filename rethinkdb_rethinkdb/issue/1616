        "I'm running workload X from 3 client machines (puzzler, riddler, kingpin) against a 2-node cluster (electro, magneto) on SSDs.\r\n\r\nThe table has 290K documents, with 4 shards and 2 replicas per shard.\r\n\r\nAfter a while connections time out (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1350 ?) and performance looks like this:\r\n![screenshot from 2013-11-06 10 39 06](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/505365/1485323/4ee0e614-4713-11e3-9538-b4d0cdb6a634.png)\r\n\r\nThe throughput afterwards goes up and down, varying between ~700 and 0 reads/s.\r\nBefore this happened, the cluster was processing ~3000 reads/sec.\r\n\r\nWhat I find suspicious about this is that both nodes utilize 100% of four of their cores when this happens. So this does not seem to be an i/o or (pure) locking problem."
