      "So the reason why I opened this issue is that the character `\177` in the `r.time` command was a problem when people were calling `help(r.time)` -- see https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/347\r\n\r\nThe thing is that it was fixed in the `gen_python.py` script -- https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/pull/352\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure what we want to test here.\r\n\r\nIt would make more sense to make sure that all the methods have a docstring (except an explicit list). That way if we add a method and forget to write docs about it, the test will return an error."
