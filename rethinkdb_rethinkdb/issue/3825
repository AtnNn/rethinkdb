        "The current table listing is sub-optimal. It's grown a lot of buttons, and it's unnecessarily complicated to do some normal kinds of operations.\r\n\r\nCase in point:\r\n\r\nDeleting a table:\r\n\r\n1. select the checkbox by the table\r\n2. go to the top right and click \"delete selected tables\"\r\n3. A modal pops up, asking you to confirm.\r\n4. Click ok on the modal\r\n5. the table disappears from the list\r\n6. A success notification pops up saying you deleted the table.\r\n7. Click the X on the notification to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nWhat should happen:\r\n\r\n1. Click a \"delete table\" icon on the table row.\r\n2. Some small confirmation action (no modal)\r\n3. The table disappears from the list.\r\n\r\nWe should have similarly easy actions for stuff like:\r\n\r\n- renaming a table\r\n- creating a new table/database\r\n\r\nThe big buttons aren't great either, we need some icons for them to make them stand out. Right now there's just a ton of huge grey buttons with nothing really distinguishing them."
