        "The current table listing is sub-optimal. It's grown a lot of buttons, and it's unnecessarily complicated to do some normal kinds of operations.\n\nCase in point:\n\nDeleting a table:\n1. select the checkbox by the table\n2. go to the top right and click \"delete selected tables\"\n3. A modal pops up, asking you to confirm.\n4. Click ok on the modal\n5. the table disappears from the list\n6. A success notification pops up saying you deleted the table.\n7. Click the X on the notification to get rid of it.\n\nWhat should happen:\n1. Click a \"delete table\" icon on the table row.\n2. Some small confirmation action (no modal)\n3. The table disappears from the list.\n\nWe should have similarly easy actions for stuff like:\n- renaming a table\n- creating a new table/database\n\nThe big buttons aren't great either, we need some icons for them to make them stand out. Right now there's just a ton of huge grey buttons with nothing really distinguishing them.\n"
