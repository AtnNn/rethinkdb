      "In regards to the original issue described here, I'd be in favor of merging this into the protocol refactoring process since this is an already acknowledged goal of that effort. In the future, these optional attributes will be included as optargs on their respective operations in the protocol spec and the server will use the known primary key for the table if the optarg is not provided. Given this, I see little reason to fix this now."
