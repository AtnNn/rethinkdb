      "@jhstatewide this has been pushed down a bit by other features, but it's definitely still on our roadmap.\r\n\r\nCan you tell us a bit about your exact scenario? One of the problems we had when designing this was that it was difficult to keep a compound geo index efficient under different scenarios. \r\nThe thing I'm most interested in is what your key distribution looks like.\r\nWhich part in your query is the most selective one? The location-based `get_nearest()`or the `filter()` on a plain value?\r\nWhat is the cardinality of the values that you want to filter on? Are there only a few possible keys or loads of different ones?\r\nDo multiple entries share the same location, but with different filter key values?"
