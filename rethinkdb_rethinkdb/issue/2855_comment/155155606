      "@adnaan I think the first query has the parentheses set wrong:\r\n```\r\nr.db('mydb').table('post').between(r.minval, r.maxval, {leftBound: \"closed\",rightBound:\"open\", index: \"uid\"}).orderBy(r.row('point').distance(r.point(77.630939, 12.953997),{unit:'km'}))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the `.distance` must be inside the `orderBy`.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the `getIntersecting` followed by a `filter` is probably the best option available right now. Unless the `filter` is the more selective part, in which case the `between.orderBy(...distance)` might give you better performance."
