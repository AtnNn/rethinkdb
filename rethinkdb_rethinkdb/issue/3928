        "I'd like to add a couple hotbuttons to data explorer -- possibly in between \"Data Explorer\" and the history button.  They would allow you to drag the highlighted query text onto them, which would bring a popup to name the button, and would execute the query when clicked.  Maybe there's also an option in the data explorer options for showing or hiding the quick buttons in case users don't want them displayed.\n\nThe reason for this is that I find myself running a lot of common queries such as \"r.db('db').table('table').delete()\" after testing out some functionality, and would just like to make that into a button instead of having to comment/uncomment query lines.\n"
