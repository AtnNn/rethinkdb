      "The current state of the code is that the review is updated with the new version of the code that holds partial batches in memory for a while the way everybody else wanted.  The main question is that of the merge of secondary indexes with batched inserts, and the exact way to write the code which updates secondary indexes.  I'll need to talk about that with Joe, and it looks like that could cause about 1-2 hours of programming.  I'm fairly confident the code could be done review by the end of Friday, depending on that and anything else that might go wrong."
