      "So testing on newton (SSD), I don't see any discernable difference in number of writes between versions 1.4 and 1.3.2.  Using a fresh data directory each time, I ran the stress client for ~20000 inserts using either one or many clients, then checked the perfmon stats for the RDB serializer.  The relevant stats should be serializer_data_blocks_written and serializer_block_writes, which were very close between the two versions for all scenarios I tried.  As expected, higher number of clients (higher throughput), resulted in less writes for both versions.\r\n\r\nOne unexpected behavior I noticed was that the server would start out with slightly low performance, which would get better after doing some inserts, stopping the stress client and restarting it in a few seconds.  This happened on both 1.4 and 1.3.2.  This temporary drop in throughput was observed to be caused by garbage collection getting too far being the targeted garbage ratio, and changing garbage collection to high-priority."
