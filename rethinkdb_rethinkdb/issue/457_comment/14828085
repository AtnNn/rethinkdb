      "Is the performance drop only when inserting into a fresh database or does it still remain after a while of inserts?\r\nThe reason this might be important: If fsync is involved, that would presumably stall the serializer thread (which might stall the webserver / web UI too?). However - assuming direct i/o - fsync should (?) only be called when resizing the database files, which will happen quite frequently in the beginning, but rarely once the database has reached a certain size. Correct?\r\n\r\nPS: Here's a change to the syncing. It seems though that the only change on Linux is to now actually check the return code of fsync and to possibly call it again in a loop if it was interrupted.\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/commit/64057735256ef8552304fd820aca645c31725dd6#src/arch/io/disk.cc\r\nAlso there is this which I guess should only affect OS X at all: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/commit/8facc79fd70d373b2f94a8d7485da80e0e3ea832#src/arch/io/disk/pool.cc"
