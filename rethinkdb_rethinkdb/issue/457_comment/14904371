      "If I look at the number of i/o transactions per second (tps) as reported by iostat, it seems that RethinkDB 1.3.2 uses pretty much exactly 3 transactions for each insert (using a single connection). On my machine, I get a rather stable 25 inserts per second, and iostat shows about 75 tps.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB 1.4 (as compiled from next) on the other hand, achieves roughly 22 inserts per second with a single connection. The i/o transactions apparently required for this are varying between 100 and more than 300, with an average of about 250 tps. This would correspond to roughly 10 tps per insert.\r\n\r\nThe write throughputs reported by iostat are on average ~0.3 MB/s for 1.3 and ~1.0 MB/s for 1.4.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, after I inserted a lot of documents into 1.4 (using 128) clients, then shut down the server, and restarted it afterwards, iostat now shows the same 75 tps at 25 inserts per seconds as for 1.3. I couldn't test yet whether this was related to the restart of the server, or the high number of documents inserted earlier.\r\n\r\nMaybe this will help to hunt down the problem..."
