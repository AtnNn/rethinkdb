      "It's very, very strange that we only get 12 writes/second (vs. 300/second with the old code) on HDDs.  I can't think of what changes to the query language would make HDDs in particular drastically slower.  Does anybody have any ideas?\r\n\r\nI have vague memories of hearing the word `fsync` with regard to changes at some point; could that be related?"
