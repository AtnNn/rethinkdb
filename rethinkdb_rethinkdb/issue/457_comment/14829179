      "Also, it is a miracle to me how the 300 writes/s reported by @neumino with a single connection on HDD were even possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nAssuming strong durability, every write involves writing 1. to the active extent and 2. to the metablock extent. This results in at least two disk-seeks per such operation. Assuming a 10000 rpm disk, there are 167 platter rotations per second. At the very least, two platter rotations are needed for one write, which yields about 80 writes/sec.\r\n\r\nWith multiple connections, you implicitly end up with write batching, so higher throughputs can be expected there.\r\n\r\nBy the way, no offense meant here of course. I'm just saying that if the 300 writes/s are actually correct, it could be that something was actually wrong in 1.3, and if they are not, you shouldn't aim to achieve that same figure in 1.4 using a single connection. Alternatively, I might just be forgetting about something important of course."
