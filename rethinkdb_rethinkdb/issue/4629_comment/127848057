      "> E.g. if you write to two different documents A and B, is it important that you can figure out from the returned IDs which one was sent first?\r\n\r\nFrom my conversation with Slava, if you send a write A and get a timestamp Ta, then send a write B and get a timestamp Tb, and then see Tb on a feed, we must guarantee that Ta should also have been reflected in that feed. (Which I think is equivalent to being able to figure out which one was sent first)."
