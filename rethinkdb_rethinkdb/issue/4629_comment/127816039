      "I was imagining that monotonically increasing IDs were important for squashing, and more generally so that if machine A sends `n` writes and tells machine B to wait for them it doesn't have to send O(n) stamps to `B` (monotonically increasing per-machine IDs work for this because you just have to send O(machine) stamps to `B` and your cluster probably isn't that big)."
