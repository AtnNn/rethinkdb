      "Hello folks - coming from the Meteor camp this seems like a much needed feature to have a working integration. Going through the comments it seems that the implementation is almost complete but it requires more testing. I personally think this feature should get a higher priority since it's a clear win-win situation. Meteor has a considerable community size and this will definitely gives RethinkDB more visibility (that is how I came to know it)  and on the other hand Meteor seems to have scaling issues that RethinkDB should be able to solve. There is a bit of churn in the Meteor community and I think this is the right time to get this moving and if there is anyway I can help I'd love to. "
