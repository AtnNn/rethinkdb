      "@coffeemug Yeah I thought so. It certainly fits well into 2.2.\r\n\r\n(@mlucy)\r\n> I think you should always be able to turn them on and off. I think we should probably leave them off by default no matter where we put them, just to make the interface less intimidating for new users\r\n\r\n(@coffeemug)\r\n> I think we should appropriate the `includeStates` optarg for this.\r\n\r\n:+1:\r\n\r\n> I think since it's a fairly advanced feature, for the first release I'd document how the timestamps are to be compared and let the users do it themselves.\r\n\r\nThat's probably right. I think we can get away with that for now. That also avoids us having to implement the logic in the Python and Ruby drivers, which wouldn't help Meteor at all."
