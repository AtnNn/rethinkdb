      "I don't think we should bump it out of 2.2 for story-telling reasons. This feature fits into a coherent story where we make it much easier for framework developers to do what they need on top of RethinkDB; without it the story for the release is much, much weaker.\r\n\r\nI think it would be much better to delay 2.2 a little bit, include this into 2.2, and start some of the 2.3 work in parallel."
