      "Instead of `[conn_id, timestamp]` it might be better to use `[branch_id, counter]`. We already internally assign one of those to every write.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage is that it might allow some kind of eventual integration with resuming changefeeds using B-tree timestamps. For example, we could put a single set of tokens on the changefeed and use them both for correlating writes and for resuming the feed."
