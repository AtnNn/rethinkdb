      "We seem to agree on the form of the timestamps, i.e. `[changefeed_server_uuid, changefeed_counter]`.\r\n\r\nFor multi-document writes, we will merge the timestamps in the `write_id` field by keeping only the highest `changefeed_counter` for any given `changefeed_server_uuid`.\r\nIn general `write_id` is going to be an array of such timestamp pairs.\r\n\r\nThere are (at least) four open questions:\r\n* Are we going to send the `write_id` with every changefeed notification, or as a separate `state` document? Putting them into the changes themselves might considerably increase the size of squashed changefeed notifications, so using a separate `state` might be better.\r\n* What should the field be called? I think `write_id` is a bad name because it doesn't convey the fact that there's a partial ordering on the IDs. I think `write_timestamp` might be a better name?\r\n* Should we require timestamp information in the changefeeds to be enabled explicitly or do we always want them to be there? I think at least if they go in their own `state` documents, they should be optional.\r\n* Should we provide a comparison function for timestamp arrays in the clients? If yes, how should it be called? Maybe the timestamp array itself should be a ReQL pseudo-type, that gets deserialized to a custom class instance with a method for comparing them?"
