      "You're right, `<shard, timestamp>` pairs are what we need to actually provide the ordering guarantee (or, even better, `<changefeed_server_uuid, timestamp>`).  And yeah, changefeeds already guarantee per-shard ordering.\r\n\r\nIs it actually true that we can't generate duplicate-free wall times?  I guess if these things are opaque then a counter instead if fine.  We can even re-use the counters that are already on `changefeed::server_t`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI don't really know enough to say whether we could use `branch_id, counter`.  That certainly seems cleaner, and we should only generate a new branch ID when resharding or failover occurs, which currently causes us to disconnect anyway."
