      "@opsb and others:\r\nUnfortunately I have bad news. We have a partially working implementation in the branch https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/tree/mlucy_write_stamps , but we haven't been able to properly test it yet. Due to all the other things ( https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/milestones/2.3 ) that still need to happen for the 2.3 release, I decided to move this out of the 2.3 milestone and instead ship the write stamps with RethinkDB 2.4. We could theoretically merge what we have right now, but there's a very high risk that it will have bugs and I wouldn't feel good about doing so.\r\n\r\nAgain apologies for the delay. I know you have been waiting for this for a while."
