      "> Which I think is equivalent to being able to figure out which one was sent first.\r\n\r\nThat's possibly true if the client has only one outstanding write at a time. In general that's not true in the current implementation, because different shards will have their own ordering for writes that is independent of the order in which the writes were submitted by a client.\r\n\r\nI imagine we could modify changefeeds to adhere to the client sequence ordering if this is really necessary."
