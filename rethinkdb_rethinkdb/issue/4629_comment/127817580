      "Actually thinking about this more I'm still a bit fuzzy on the use case for this feature.\r\n\r\nSpecifically: The way I understand this, the idea is to know when a given write has been reflected in the database and has started to be broadcasted to all subscribed users.\r\n\r\nIn the original proposal the idea was to accomplish this by getting some sort of ID for a given write, and then waiting for that ID to show up on the changefeed. However in that case, one could just as well simply wait on the write to be acknowledged, which has about the same effect.\r\n\r\nIs there more to this? @slava would you mind clarifying?"
