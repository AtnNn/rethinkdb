      "Gah, disappointing :( Completely understand about not wanting to merge something shaky though, I certainly appreciate the general reliability of rethinkdb. \r\n\r\nI'm keen to at least get what's there running locally so I can start to develop against it. My c++ isn't so hot these days (must have been nearly 15 years since I last wrote any), if you guys could provide any pointers regarding how to use the timestamps in the client it would be greatly appreciated :)"
