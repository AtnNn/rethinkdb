      "Just adding a :+1: for including the timestamps in separate state document. If a client is subscribed to a query that doesn't include all results from a table then it's possible they could write a change to the table which wouldn't be included in their results. If separate state documents are used then this isn't a problem, the state document can be included in the changefeed even though the write itself won't be."
