      "That and we might request the wall time on multiple threads in the same moment.\r\n\r\nI think `[changefeed_server_uuid, changefeed_counter]` would currently be equivalent to `[branch_id, replication_counter]`. So as far as I can tell either should work, and they are indistinguishable from the client's perspective so we could swap them out later if we want to.\r\nNew branch IDs are also generated when a primary is restarted, even if no failover occurs in between."
