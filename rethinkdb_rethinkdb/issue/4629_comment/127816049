      "> How do we return write ids when the user does a batch write?\r\n\r\nIf we use `[client_id, counter]`, we could use the same id for all writes in the batched write.\r\nWe could assign the counter on a per-query basis on the parsing node. All `write_t`s generated from that query will have the `client_id`/`counter` pair, and the changefeeds will submit that with their notifications when the writes are executed.\r\nOne problem with this is that it's not clear when the whole query has completed."
