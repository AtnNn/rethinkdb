      "It should also be noted that implementing this will limit our options for future optimizations in changefeeds. It relies on the changefeed client to always receive all notifications for the whole table, even if all changefeeds are just on a specific key range (`between`) or for a certain `filter`.\r\n\r\nIt's probably easier from our side to assign individual IDs to every modified document. I can see though that this will become a limiting factor in some types of queries (e.g. a `r.table(...).delete()`) can easily touch millions of document)."
