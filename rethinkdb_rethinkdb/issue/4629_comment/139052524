      "Actually even if we don't make the timestamps their own pseudo type, I think they should probably be an object of the form\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"changefeed server 1 UUID\": changefeed_counter1,\r\n  \"changefeed server 2 UUID\": changefeed_counter2,\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would make the check for whether a given write timestamp has been reflected in a changefeed more convenient to implement."
