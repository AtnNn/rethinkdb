      "I believe I have a fix for the crash - which appears to be an uncaught exception.  Unfortunately, though, I don't think it will fix your connectivity issues, @scottder.  The fix addresses a problem where one peer connects to a second peer, and is informed of a _third_ peer which has an unresolvable address (in review 3593).\r\n\r\nThis will not fix the connectivity problems because the first peer still cannot resolve the address to the third peer, and you will not get full connectivity.  I may be misunderstanding your situation, but it sounds like you only have two nodes (one internal, one on AWS), so it's a little confusing where the third peer address would be coming from.  This could be explained by stale peer information being kept alive by one of the peers from an old configuration.  If this is the case, shutting down both nodes then restarting them should work."
