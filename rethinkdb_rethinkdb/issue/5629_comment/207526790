      "So the internal host can reach the public AWS host on port 29015 and I have the public IP address set as the canonical in AWS.\r\n\r\nThe AWS instance can't route publicly over the internet back to 29015 however. In previous testing this didn't prevent things from working in my previous tests ( the AWS instance doesn't have join statements back to the internal either."
