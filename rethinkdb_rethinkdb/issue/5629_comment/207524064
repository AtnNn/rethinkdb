      "Hi @scottder , have you set the canonical addresses to publicly reachable addresses? Can the internal host reach the public one on the cluster port (29015), as well as the public one the internal one through its canonical address?\r\n\r\nThe first error suggests that maybe the address passed to `--join` / `-j` isn't a public address. Could that be?\r\n\r\n\r\nThat crash with the backtrace definitely looks like a bug. Pinging @Tryneus .\r\n\r\nI wonder if it could be related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4470#issuecomment-120178753 . Can you check if you can find any messages \"Invalid address family returned by `getaddrinfo`, are you using nscd with EGLIBC 2.19?\" in the rethinkdb log?\r\nCan you email us your `ifconfig` output from the affected server as well (daniel@rethinkdb.com)?
