      "In `raft_member_t<state_t>::check_invariants` it tries to acquire the Raft lock within ten seconds, and if it fails to do so it crashes with the above message. Thus if anything in the Raft path, which does both disk and network I/O, takes over ten seconds it shows this crash. Having never seen this on either Linux or OS X I'm tempted to say something in the Windows port blocks for too long."
