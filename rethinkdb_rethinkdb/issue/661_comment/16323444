      "I tend to think that we should implement prefetching in all drivers, turn it off by default, and allow people to turn it on if they need it. However, I wouldn't do this until we have strong user demand for this -- I'd just leave all drivers as is until this actually becomes a problem. In any case, it's a whole feature we need to think through, so moving to backlog."
