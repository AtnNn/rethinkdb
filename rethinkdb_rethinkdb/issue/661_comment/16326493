      "@srh as far as I can tell the user does not have any control on the batch size so there is nothing they can do. If we implement configurable batch sizes than my argument could be wrong. I'm saying \"could\", because I strongly believe that drivers should do what the user says (I'm in favor of fine grained tuning vs heuristics implemented on our side)"
