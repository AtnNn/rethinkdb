      "I think that a 2x performance gain in exchange for <100 lines of code is usually a reasonable tradeoff.\r\n\r\nOn other issues:\r\n\r\n> User specified batch sizes (with or without prefetching 1 ahead).\r\n\r\nThis sounds good.\r\n\r\n> Having the protocol support splitting up batched replies.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean?\r\n\r\n> Arbitrary prefetching several batches ahead.\r\n\r\nAlso good, although of minimal utility without some server changes.\r\n\r\n> Support in the protocol for responses in a different order than requests.\r\n\r\nAlso good.\r\n"
