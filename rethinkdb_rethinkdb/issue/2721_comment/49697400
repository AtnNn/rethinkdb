      "Some people do put a `coerceTo(\"ARRAY\")` at the end of a query because it's annoying to deal with a cursor (especially in JavaScript), see for example\r\n- http://irclogger.com/.rethinkdb/2014-03-25#1395774127\r\n- https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash/issues/31\r\n\r\nI think we should automatically have the driver fetch all the data from a cursor and if people really want a cursor for some reason, they can pass an optarg to `run`. I basically think we should do https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash/issues/31\r\n\r\n\r\nThe case that is really annoying (where it adds frictions for no real benefits) is when people do NoSQL-ish join (using `merge` and `getAll`). The have to put a `coerceTo(\"ARRAY\")` at the end of every sub queries.\r\nThis friction is really useful since if they somehow have more than 100.00 elements in a sub array, they will just spend some time figuring out what is this `OPAQUE SELECTION` error (and if you look at the results provided [by Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=Expected+type+DATUM+but+found+SELECTION&oq=expected+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59j0l4.4235j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8), it's not easy to understand what's the problem). And then they will just hit the limit on arrays and have to rewrite the whole thing with a SQL-ish query.\r\n\r\nI also think that it's a pain for users to require them to understand what is the difference between a stream and an array. It's reflected by the number of questions we get about cursors.\r\nUsers should have to understand how RethinkDB behaves under the hood __only__ in advanced cases, and not as soon as they try to do a join."
