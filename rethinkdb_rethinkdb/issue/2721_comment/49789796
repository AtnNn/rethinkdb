      "@danielmewes -- we're talking about something different here, though. The question is -- if you write a query that, say, does a join that returns a stream, and tries to write that stream to a field of a document, do we coerce implicitly or force people to coerce explicitly?\r\n\r\nCoercion of cursors to arrays is a related, but different question."
