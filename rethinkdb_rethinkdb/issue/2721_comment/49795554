      "Let's talk about the cursor thing separately.  I'm hesitant to automatically convert arrays (although I'm coming around a bit), but I'm outright opposed to getting rid of cursors by default.  Even if you ignore the practical benefits, they drastically improve the perceived latency of queries in blocking languages, and as far as I can tell perceived latency is 99% of what people are talking about when they say something feels slow.  (This is also why we make the first batch smaller in the current code.)"
