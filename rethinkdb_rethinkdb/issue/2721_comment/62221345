      "I've been developing against RTDB almost everyday for the past 7 months. So I'll throw in what I've noticed...\r\n\r\nHaving to coerce to arrays IS a nuisance, its an easily overcome one though. Just one more step that is often forgotten.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes is right. Wanting a cursor IS the edge case, I have plenty of `toArray` calls in my Nodejs server code. The only time I specifically wanted a cursor was when I was working on a data import/conversion script. It was specifically designed to iterate to keep memory usage low."
