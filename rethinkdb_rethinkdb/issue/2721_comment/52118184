      "We need to be very, very careful when making this change that we don't start automatically coercing streams to arrays internally when we don't need to.  The tests wouldn't catch that.  We should probably write some tests that would.  (We could also take the tests which return largish streams and run them with a small array size limit to make sure they aren't doing that.)"
