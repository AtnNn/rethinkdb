      "From an implementation perspective, `as_datum` and `as_array` on vals and sequences need to succeed rather than throwing.  `is_convertible` needs to change too, and we need to audit all calls to `is_convertible` to make sure that terms which are polymorphic on streams and datums don't take the wrong branch once streams are convertible to datums.  (Hopefully these would show up in the tests, but we should audit the code anyway.)\r\n\r\n`coerce_to` might need some changes as well.  Nothing else comes to mind, but there might be something I'm forgetting."
