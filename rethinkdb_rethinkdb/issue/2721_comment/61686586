      "One way to get a single element out of RethinkDB right now is to append `.nth(0).default({})` to your query (you can drop `.default` if you *know* you'll be getting at least one element, or if you're ok with getting an error if there isn't anything returned by the query). We should make this simpler -- I've opened #3283 with a proposal."
