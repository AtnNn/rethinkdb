      "@danielmewes this is something that should be pretty low impact unless the code that opens the network connection is custom built. Most 3rd party stuff include making unix sockets pretty easy. And just needs to be parsed at start up if it needs to open a tcp connection or a socket.\r\n\r\nFrom what i remeber about using unix sockets over ipv4 you use AF_UNIX insteed of AF_INET and insteed of a ip address a path to a socket file that you want to be created.
