      "Just started experimenting with RethinkDB (thanks for the great work!) and was surprised it doesn't have this. Seemed to come standard in other data stores I've used (Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.).\r\nWould the patch for this be new-contributor friendly? And (since I see this is marked \"backlog\") would it get reviewed/merged any time soon?\r\nThanks again for the great work on RethinkDB."
