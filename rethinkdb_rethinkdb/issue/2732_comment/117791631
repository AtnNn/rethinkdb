      "The fix for https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4383 includes logic that prioritizes smaller backfills over large ones, so that more tables get up to date more quickly. It will also prioritize backfills that are critical to table availability over those that are not.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be too hard at this point to make the priority at which tables will get backfilled configurable."
