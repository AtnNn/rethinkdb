      "This is in code-review 757 by @srh.  It was another combination of lazy initialization / checkpoints.  (Incidentally, that may be literally the worst design decision I've ever made.)\r\n\r\nThis would also be fixed by shared pointers, but the fix was mostly done by the time I was sure I'd identified the bug, so I just finished it and made a regression test.\r\n\r\n(Also, we can cherry-pick this commit into 1.4.x pretty easily if we want to.  @coffeemug -- is that worth doing?)"
