      "It's not obvious how shards should be represented in the entries. Though we could use their index into the `table_config` shard array.\r\n\r\nThere's also the question of how useful this will be for users. For most use cases of the `jobs` table the shards probably don't matter.\r\nI think you need this data for the backfill test though, right?\r\nAn alternative source for information about ongoing backfills on a per-shard basis is the `table_status` table, where shards that are backfilling will be in the `\"backfilling\"` state."
