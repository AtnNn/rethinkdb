      "My proximate use case is of course the tests that I am writing. I realized that I could not verify that a given backfill entry in the `rethinkdb.jobs` table was the one I just caused. The `table_status` information would be a second circumstantial bit of evidence, but still does not directly connect one to the other. This is definitely not a blocker, but does seem a missing piece.\r\n\r\nAs to the usefulness to users, the one that comes to mind would be someone building a reconfiguration tool. If it was doing something complicated to live-migrate among multiple servers it would be a lot easier to write if it had better insight into what was done and what was not.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of how to expose this, I don't have any ideas better than adding a uuid, and that feels a bit heavyweight."
