      "Binding only to 127.0.0.1 in addition to whatever is specific in `--bind` would solve our problem. A custom built binary wouldn't, since we're contending with the defaults on what people run remotely.\r\n\r\nNote that changing the behavior of `--bind` doesn't actually fix our problem. It would let us write docs to tell customers how to change their config, but we're trying to figure out how best to make things coexist by default.\r\n\r\nI don't understand is when someone would *ever* want all loopback IPs bound? This seems different than what most other DBs do."
