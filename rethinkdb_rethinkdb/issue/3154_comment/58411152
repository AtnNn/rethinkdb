      "@Tryneus's comment made me think through this a bit, and there is a further problem here: all three of the ports (driver, cluster, and http) are currently always available on all of the same interfaces. This comes up because the only case where I would think that my proposed change would break things is in the cases such as the inter-cluster communications being used on one IP address, and http access being done locally. Anyone think this is worth a separate bug?\r\n\r\nI am ok with us changing this and maybe breaking things until people explicitly add `--bind 127.0.0.1` when they have a second `--bind`."
