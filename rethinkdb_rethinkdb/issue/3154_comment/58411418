      "I think what @VeXocide describes is reasonable. We could have the `--bind no-loopback` argument in addition to only binding to 127.0.0.1, in case someone does *not* want to bind even to 127.0.0.1.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion having to explicitly specify 127.0.0.1 as a second address when using the `--bind` argument is a little bit less convenient. The other argument against it is that it will break compatibility for more users than the alternatives.\r\n\r\nOverall I don't feel strongly about this. Any of the suggested solutions sound ok. (keep current behavior but add `--bind no-loopback` option, bind to only 127.0.0.1 (and possibly still add the option), only bind to specified addresses if `--bind` is given)\r\n\r\n@mrkurt if we bound to only 127.0.0.1 in addition to the addresses specified through `--bind`, would that work for your use case?"
