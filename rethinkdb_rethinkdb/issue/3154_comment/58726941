      "> I think it would make more sense if we bound to all loopback addresses by default and allowed users to override that behavior in some way\r\n\r\nI agree.  I think \"I'm running debian\" is much more common than \"I have multiple loopback addresses and don't want to bind to all of them\", so I'd rather make people pass a flag to cause the second behavior."
