      "Sorry for not chiming in on this earlier, but I think there are very good reasons not to only bind 127.0.0.1 .\r\n\r\nFor example, see section 5.1.1 of http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch05.en.html .  Debian often has this in its hosts file:\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1 localhost\r\n127.0.1.1 <host_name>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's extremely confusing for connecting to the local machine by name not to work by default."
