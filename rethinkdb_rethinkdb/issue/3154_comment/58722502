      "> It's extremely confusing for connecting to the local machine by name not to work by default.\r\n\r\nThis is probably one of those things were everyone has slightly different expectations, but I don't think that it's *that* confusing. I usually expect servers to bind to `localhost`. I wouldn't necessarily expect them to bind to any other hostnames (or rather the addresses behind those hostnames), even if they are loopback devices.\r\nI guess this is also a question of documentation. The `rethinkdb --help` output now says \"if not specified, 127.0.0.1 and ::1 will be used\". That's pretty explicit. Generally we should be careful to not confuse this and accidentally say that it binds to local (or loopback) interfaces."
