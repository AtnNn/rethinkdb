      "> What if we made it so that if --bind is given a loopback address, we don't include other loopback addresses automatically, or is that too much magic?\r\n\r\nYeah, I think that would be quite unexpected.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure if a new option is better or `--bind no-loopback`. What's confusing about the latter is that `--bind` usually *adds* interfaces to the list, but doesn't remove anything.\r\nIt's also confusing if someone writes `--bind no-loopback --bind 127.0.0.1`. Since 127.0.0.1 is also a loopback interface, the two options are formally conflicting. In practice it's pretty clear what the user wants here though, so this might not actually be an issue.\r\nI'm very slightly leaning towards adding a completely new option `--no-loopback`.\r\n\r\n@larkost, @VeXocide, @AtnNn Do you have preference for one of the options?"
