      "So, I'd like to avoid adding new command-line options if possible (we already have quite a few, and this one is only useful in very specific situations).  What if we made it so that if `--bind` is given a loopback address, we don't include other loopback addresses automatically, or is that too much magic?\r\n\r\nIf not, I'm torn between `--no-loopback` and `--bind no-loopback`, the first makes slightly more sense, but will add yet another command-line option."
