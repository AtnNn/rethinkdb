      "That seems like a bad idea.  I think I agree with what you said above: it's going to break a lot of people's configurations, and it won't be at all obvious why.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I realize I'm late to the party here, but this change seems pretty bad to me.  I think the setup we're trying to make easier is a lot rarer than the setups we're making more confusing, and even if that weren't the case I don't think either setup is compelling enough to warrant breaking existing configurations by changing the meaning of `--bind`.  I would much, much rather go back to the old behavior and just add a new option (or new argument to `--bind`) to turn off binding to loopback addresses."
