      "> This is probably one of those things were everyone has slightly different expectations, but I don't think that it's that confusing.\r\n\r\nI would find it pretty weird if I started RethinkDB on newton (imagine it's running debian), and connecting to `localhost` worked but connecting to `newton` didn't.  I'd also be surprised if I ran `rethinkdb --bind <ethernet>`, and connecting to `localhost` worked, connecting to `newton` from `magneto` worked, but connecting to `newton` from `newton` didn't."
