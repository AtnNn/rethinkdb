      "Ok, after thinking about this again I believe the best solution is this:\r\n- Restore the old behavior. Bind to all loopback interfaces by default, and even if `--bind` is specified, still bind to all loopback interfaces in addition to the specified ones.\r\n- Add a separate option `--no-loopback` that disables binding to loopback interfaces (I would also be fine with a special value that can be passed to `--bind`, e.g. `--bind no-loopback --bind 192.168.0`). If the option is used without specifying at least one `--bind` explicitly, it should fail with an error.\r\n\r\nI realize this doesn't fully solve the issue of users running into port conflicts when using the default setting (@mrkurt ). You will have to tell your users that they have to add that the \"--no-loopback --bind 127.0.0.1\" option on their local instance if they run into port conflicts.\r\n\r\nOverall I think this would be the most intuitive behavior, considering that - as pointed out by @mlucy - some systems appear to configure loopback interfaces other than 127.0.0.1 by default and bind them to the machine's host name."
