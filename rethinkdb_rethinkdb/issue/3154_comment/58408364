      "So, this is by design - we always bind to all loopback addresses (anything `127.x.x.x`).  This is so people only need to specify external interfaces in `--bind`, because it would be confusing if you didn't specify any loopback addresses and then you can't connect to a local server.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should change this behavior, but we could add a parameter to prevent binding to loopback addresses, something like `--bind no-loopback`.  This would allow you to explicitly set which loopback interfaces you want `rethinkdb` to bind to.  Opinions?"
