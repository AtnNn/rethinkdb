      "How about always binding just 127.0.0.1? Binding that single IP seems like what most local servers do.\r\n\r\nFor us, the default is actually the problem. We're contending with a bunch of people running whatever Homebrew / other package manager gives them. For other DBs, having people use other loopback IPs for port forwards seems to keep us conflict free without them having to futz about with their local servers."
