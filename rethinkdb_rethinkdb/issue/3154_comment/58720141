      "@mlucy, I believe that was originally added alongside the `bind` option in #28.  It's also mentioned in rethinkdb/rethinkdb-deprecated#548 (private repo).\r\n\r\nThe point is that there is nothing particularly special about `127.0.0.1` in the standard, and it just so happens that most distributions use `127.0.0.1` as the default loopback address.  Thankfully this is resolved in IPv6 where there is only one loopback address, `::1`, but we still have to deal with this for now.\r\n\r\nI've said many times before that when it comes to networking, it is nearly impossible to support every crazy configuration that people will come up with.  What we can do is have sensible defaults and allow users enough control to configure it the way they want.  In this case, we were failing that as there was no way to prevent `rethinkdb` from binding to particular loopback addresses.\r\n\r\nI think it would make more sense if we bound to all loopback addresses by default and allowed users to override that behavior in some way, but I believe that would increase complexity in the command-line options."
