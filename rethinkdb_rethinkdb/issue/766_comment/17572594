      "@visionmedia, we rely on LESS and CoffeeScript for both the web UI and the JS driver-- it's proven to be useful in our development process.\r\n\r\nHowever, we provide a source distribution with all these assets precompiled specifically because on some platforms these tools behave unpredictably. It's detailed in our build instructions: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/build/\r\n\r\nYou can always find the latest source builds here: http://download.rethinkdb.com/dist/"
