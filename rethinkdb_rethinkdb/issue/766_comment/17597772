      "@mtrimpe he doesn't ship Express with Stylus, there's a difference. Also, I fail to see the negative tone in TJ's comments, he just wanted those dependencies removed, and when he realized everything is written in CS he closed this issue. There's some serious overreacting going on here.\r\n\r\n@on-topic: I had many situations where I needed to read / alter the code of some module because the documentation didn't cover 100% of the use cases and fortunately it wasn't that hard. That's why I always prefer modules written in plain JavaScript instead of CoffeeScript / Dart / etc etc. Sure, this is a personal preference and I have nothing against this driver being written in CoffeeScript, only thing is I just won't use it.\r\n\r\nThis situation reminds me of the Riak driver: http://basho.com/a-fresh-start-for-riak-js/"
