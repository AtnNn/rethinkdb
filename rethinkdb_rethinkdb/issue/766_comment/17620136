      "I honestly cannot read coffeescript, we use one coffeescript project, an exif parser and it's already becoming a pain in the ass because we need to make mods. I closed the issue because yeah, it is what it is but there's no disputing that it absolutely makes contributions more difficult. I would be equally disappointed if it were dart or similar. This applies to anything though, I look at the source of every single thing I include as a dependency, if it's extremely messy (even if it's js) I won't use it."
