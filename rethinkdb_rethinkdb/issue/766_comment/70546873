      "There have been some thoughts on adopting https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash as the official RethinkDB node.js driver. Rethinkdbdash is written in JavaScript directly. It doesn't have capabilities for connecting to the server through HTTP yet (we need that for the web UI), so we have to implement that first.\r\n\r\nNote that we will still be using less and coffeescript for the web UI code, so the dependencies won't change."
