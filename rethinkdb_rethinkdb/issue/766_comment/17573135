We've found it hasn't been a deterrent to contributions, but your point is well-taken-- you're welcome to look at the compiled JS output from the [latest build package](http://download.rethinkdb.com/dist/rethinkdb-1.4.5.tgz)-- the output is located at `drivers/javascript/build/rethinkdb.js`.\r\n\r\nThe compiled version is well-documented and readable-- check it out!"
