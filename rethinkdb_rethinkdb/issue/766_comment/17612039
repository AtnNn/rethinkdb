      "> That's why I always prefer modules written in plain JavaScript instead of CoffeeScript / Dart / etc etc. Sure, this is a personal preference and I have nothing against this driver being written in CoffeeScript, only thing is I just won't use it.\r\n\r\nYour opinions are 100% valid for you, and I'd love to read them on your blog, discuss them on HN or Reddit, and so forth. It's a vital topic. I don't even disagree with you much: My http://allong.es library is written in vanilla JavaScript but the tests are in CoffeeScript ;-)\r\n\r\nBut is this *really* a bug or feature request? Somehow, I think not, and I suspect that the issues tool is not the best place to make this kind of contribution."
