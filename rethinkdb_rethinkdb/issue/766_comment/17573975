      "The issue isn't that you use coffeescript. It is more that you are claiming to have a \"javascript\" driver/module but it isn't cause you use coffescript (which is a separate language). To me, this is confusing for anyone but the initiated. I can crosspile python to js, but that doesn't mean I am publishing js modules like that :/\r\n\r\nBy all means, continue to use whatever you love and keep making cool stuff tho!!"
