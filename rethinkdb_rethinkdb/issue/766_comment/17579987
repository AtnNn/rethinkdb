      "Hi all, I'm the one who nudged @wmrowan to use CoffeeScript to write the driver. I'm his boss, so the responsibility is mine.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I was a little hurt to find that folks made disparaging comments and then edited them when this issue got twitter attention. Nothing makes the team here happier than knowing that people are taking the time out of their day to play with Rethink. We *always* welcome criticism, and we try and take full responsibility for all technical decisions. However, we really don't appreciate finding curses in our inbox. Everyone is in this together to make technology a little bit better -- could we please keep things civil?\r\n\r\nAs to using coffee for the driver, it makes our development process much easier but I can see how it can be confusing to the community. I'm going to reopen this issue and do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Make build instructions without extended dependencies (less, handlebars, etc.) described by @mglukhovsky above (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/766#issuecomment-17572594) much more prominent on the build page.\r\n2. Revise the wording on the site for the JS driver to make it clear that it's written in CoffeeScript.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we'll see if we can change the build process to build Rethink without the web UI if any of the dependencies (handlebars, etc.) are missing and Rethink wasn't downloaded via a source distribution. This should be pretty easy, but we have to discuss this a bit first.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone for your feedback -- please keep it coming!\r\n\r\n"
