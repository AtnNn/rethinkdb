        "Although @larkost mentioned there would be some implementation problems I think this would be a lot more natural way to retrieving an array of documents given that I have their associated `id`s. \n\nRight now in Python I have to add the `*` splat to take the list and apply the contents as individual parameters this: \n\n``` python\nlist_of_ids = [...]\n\nr.table(\"test\").table(\"test\").get_all(*list_of_ids) \n```\n\nMy other options are using `.map` but that doesn't seem very intuitive or ergonomic for this use case, or running `r.get(...)` for each element in the list which seems inefficient. \n"
