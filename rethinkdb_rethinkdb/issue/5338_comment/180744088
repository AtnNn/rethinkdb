      "Had a look.\r\n\r\nFirst thing is that you want to be on Ubuntu 16.x, because the dev team at Ubuntu recently said this is the most stable with the most mature functionality both for snapcraft and Ubuntu core.\r\n\r\nTheir dev mailing list is the only way to communicate with them. No github issues etc :) its old school mailing lists.\r\n\r\nsnappy-devel@lists.ubuntu.com\r\n\r\nI am away at the moment and don't have time to start on the repo, but will definitly try it on my Mac when I am back\r\n"
