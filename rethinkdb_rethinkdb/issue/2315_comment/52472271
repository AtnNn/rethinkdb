      "`rethinkdb dump` doesn't work for me at all though there's `/usr/local/bin` in PATH. However, `which rethinkdb` gives me `/usr/bin/rethinkdb`, and `/usr/bin` is already in PATH, too.\r\n\r\nI also indicated the absolute path `/usr/bin/rethinkdb`, but still not help.\r\n\r\nAbout the replaced solution of @AtnNn: the command runs (the output log is printed) but no file created...\r\n"
