This way people aren't lost if things go wrong.\n- `rethinkdb import --help` isn't equivalent to `rethinkdb help import`. According to #245 it's supposed to be.\n- `rethinkdb proxy --help` isn't equivalent to `rethinkdb help proxy`. According to #245 it's supposed to be.\n- Occasionally (but not always) `rethinkdb proxy --help` prints `basic_string::_S_create` on OS X. There must be some memory bug somewhere.\n\nAssigning to @Tryneus -- we should get this out in a point release.\n\nEDIT: also, once `make test` is a little bit more mature I'm going to write a bunch of tests to test the hell out of this.\n"
