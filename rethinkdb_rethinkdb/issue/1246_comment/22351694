      "Ahhh... OK, so the versions I did use actually worked, and modifying the config.mk file let me use the globally (npm install -g) installed versions...\r\n\r\nI would go back and try to delete the precompiled folder, but I've already made my way through installing it (yay)... \r\n\r\nBut my main point was that the overriding of the versions is a feature that is clearly present in the help text, but doesn't... actually work when you use it, unless my syntax was wrong"
