      "The error message you are getting seems unrelated to overriding the location of dependencies.\r\n\r\nYou may be able to solve the problem by deleting the `precompiled/` folder and its contents and rebuilding the web assets yourself.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB should `npm install` the specific version of less and coffee that it requires to build. We don't recommend using your own version of coffee or less because there have been backwards incompatible changes between minor versions and revisions."
