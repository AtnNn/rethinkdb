        "We've been talking about this for a while -- this is an issue to track it.\n\nLong queries that operate on large chunks of data that fit in RAM tend to monopolize a CPU core during the QL execution, blocking out all other operations on that core. The obvious solution is to do what most other language runtimes with green thread implementations do -- automatically yield to the coroutine scheduler after some constant number of evaluations (I believe Erlang yields after few hundred evals, we'll need to find a good constant).\n\nMoving to subsequent.\n"
