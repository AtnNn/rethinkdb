      "In review 943 by @srh.\r\n\r\nAlso, `get_svs` doesn't seem to be called when you reshard a table.  We have 4 hash shards per range shard even when there are multiple range shards on the same machine, right?  I think I'm missing something here.\r\n\r\nWith the changes in review 943, the insert benchmark I mentioned in #1369 still doesn't perform any better with 4 shards than with 1."
