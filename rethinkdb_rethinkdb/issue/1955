        "In https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1556, the impact of secondary index operations on reads was minimized. I also tested writes back then and they were ok-ish.\r\n\r\nHowever I now tested a different write workload (inserting 512 byte documents in batches of 100 with soft durability at the maximally possible rate), and got pretty terrible results.\r\n\r\nBefore creating the secondary index, the write rate from a single client is ~13K inserts/s. While the secondary index post-construction is traversing the btree, the throughput drops to about 500 inserts/s. Then, once the traversal is complete, it goes into a mode where it processes the queued-up writes that were processed while the sindex was traversing the (snapshotted) tree. During that time, the insert throughput drops to less than 50 inserts/s and stays there for quite a while until the sindex post construction has completed. Pretty horrible."
