        "This is a repost of https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash/issues/261\nMore relevant here.\n\nFirst off, not sure if this is a feature request or an issue or am I just missing something.\n\nI have been able to set up change feeds successfully - so that RethinkDB informs the Nodejs server when changes happen to a table's documents and Nodejs in turn passes it on. But am stuck on trying to apply (Now-15minutes) on changefeeds. Think this can help make some powerful apps\n\nSome usecases\n\nE.g. 1:\nI would like RethinkDB to tell my app server that my cached copy of data has become old enough and I should refresh it.\n\nE.g. 2\nI can store all front-end click-stream data in localStorage and when RethinkDB says that we should sync that data, 2 minutes have passed, then the server can ask frontend to send it.\n\nE.g. 3\nMy Usecase:\nI am building a crawler/rss feed parser with RethinkDB and Nodejs.\nNow, I need to set up a time-bound refresh on the non-pubsubhubbub feeds I pull. So, if 15 minutes have passed since last refresh on any feeds in my table, go again.\n\nlastUpdated timestamp in document. I would like to use it like this:\n\n```\n    r.db('test').table('test')\n        .filter(doc=>{\n            return doc('lastUpdated').lt(new Date()-15*60000);\n        }).changes().run()\n        .then(change=>{\n             change.on('data',()=>{\n                      //parsing logic\n                      //This will run all day, with rethinkDB popping feeds to server as they become old\n                      //- so for a 1000 feeds, 1 change initiated by RethinkDB every 900 ms. \n                      //Hope you get the idea\n            })\n        });\n```\n\nThe above code doesn't work as I want it to (although it works as I expect it to)\nLooks like the \"new Date()\" I provide is taken as the moment when the change feed was set up.\n\nOr is there another way to do this that I am missing?\n\nElse, Is it possible to add that functionality to RethinkDB/dash? Not sure if there are performance implications?\n"
