        "Right now pathspecs are kind hairy due to Java's lack of nice hashmap and List literals:\r\n\r\nin javascript: \r\n```js\r\nr.table('foo').filter({x: {y: {z: \"bar\"}}})\r\n```\r\nturns into the java query:\r\n```java\r\nr.table(\"foo\").filter(r.hashMap(\"x\", r.hashMap(\"y\", r.hashMap(\"z\", \"bar\"))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince depth-first is more common in path-specs than breadth first, it might make sense to have a special `r.pathspec` convenience that creates the appropriate hashmap structure. It might look something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nr.table(\"foo\").filter(r.pathspec(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"bar\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI haven't really thought about branching pathspecs too much, maybe there's no syntax that would work well. It's something to think about."
