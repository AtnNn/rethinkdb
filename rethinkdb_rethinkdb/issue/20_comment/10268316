      "Here's a related bug in older PostgreSQL version by the way, even though it refers to ext3/4, not ReiserFS.\r\nhttp://postgresql.1045698.n5.nabble.com/We-really-ought-to-do-something-about-O-DIRECT-and-data-journalled-on-ext4-td3287127.html\r\nIt seems that ext3/ext4 do report a failure on opening a file with O_DIRECT in journaled mode though, while ReiserFS seems to accept it and then maybe just misbehaves (whatever that means for semantics so badly defined and/or documented as the direct I/O ones on Linux).\r\n\r\nPS: Indeed, on ext4 with data=journal, RethinkDB detects the condition properly and prints the appropriate message, including the text \"- the database file is located on a filesystem that doesn't support O_DIRECT open flag (e.g. in case when the filesystem is working in journaled mode)\"."
