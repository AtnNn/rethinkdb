      "Hmm, if I had to guess, I'd say reiser probably opens the file with the page cache but doesn't fsync on every write (just an uneducated guess, though)\r\n\r\nI don't like the idea of explicitly checking for it -- we should actually figure out *why* we crash. We also shouldn't crash on a bad rethinkdb file in this way (we should give a friendlier error message). I'm moving this issue to backlog because there are more pressing issues at the moment and this seems like a rare configuration. I added #30 for documenting this limitation."
