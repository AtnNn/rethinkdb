      "I see. I guess from the querying perspective that would work, we would simply treat the primary key like a secondary key. That would come with a performance penalty, but might be ok.\r\n\r\nAdministrative operations such as backfilling would have to traverse the whole tree, rather than just a shard. That too might be ok, but again would cause some performance issues.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should push that change through too quickly. It needs careful thought."
