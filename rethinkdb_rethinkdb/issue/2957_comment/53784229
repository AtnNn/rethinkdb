      "We should consider starting parallelizing now.\r\n\r\n* Pro: I suspect that the web UI implementation will end up being the last thing holding up the release, so it might be good to start it as soon as possible. It will probably take us a week or two to implement `server_status`, `db_config`, and `cluster_config`, play with it, finalize the spec, and implement the spec.\r\n\r\n* Con: When we finalize the spec, Michel will have to update his code. This will be annoying, but the changes will be mostly cosmetic, so it probably won't take more than a day total (broken into several pieces).\r\n\r\n* Pro: If Michel starts working now, he can give us feedback before the spec is finalized.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? @coffeemug @neumino"
