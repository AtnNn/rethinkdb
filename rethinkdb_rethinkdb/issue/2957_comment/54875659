      "- Oh, I've been mostly using `table_status`. I guess `table_config` should be easier to get the number of replicas.\r\n\r\nCould we have \"num_replicas\" and \"num_shards\" be read-only values? People should use `reconfigure` if they don't want to pin servers.\r\n\r\n- About `server_status`, what I would like to have is all its responsabilities (all the shards for which the server is a director/replica)"
