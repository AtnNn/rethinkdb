      "- Could a shard in `table_status` have a field `position` to know which shard it is? We don't send back split points anymore, so there is nothing to identify a shard beside its position in the field `shards`. However, as soon as you filter (like for example looking for a certain server, this information is lost.\r\nAdding the shard's position is doable, but really not pretty -- see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2574\r\n\r\n- Could server_status returns what shard is hosted on each server? Getting this information out of the API with one ReQL query is currently way to hard."
