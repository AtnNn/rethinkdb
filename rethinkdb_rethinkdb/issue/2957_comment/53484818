      "I thought the users would see exactly what they put in and the hashing would happen transparently. We'd still store the original ID in the BTree, and only use the hashed version for routing.\r\n\r\nThat does involve work on range queries -- we'd effectively have to treat pkey range queries as we do secondary indexes. I don't know how much work that is -- if it's more than a few days of work, it's not worth doing; we should just pick a sensible lexicographic scheme for now and move on."
