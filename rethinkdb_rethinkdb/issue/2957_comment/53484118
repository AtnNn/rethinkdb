      "@coffeemug That still seems to require most of the work that would be required for supporting hash sharding natively. We would have to change how range queries work for example. There's also the issue of collisions. Another question would be what we return back to the user when they read the document. Would they see the hash or would we store the original key in a different field and hide the hash from user queries?"
