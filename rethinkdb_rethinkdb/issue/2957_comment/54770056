      "Could we let people overshard? (specify more shards than the number of servers they have).\r\n\r\nI've never heard of anyone doing that with RethinkDB, but one way to keep availability when sharding is to overshard.\r\nFor example if you have one server, you could do\r\n- Create a table with 4 shards (have all the shards on one server)\r\n- Add a server\r\n- Set 2 replicas\r\n- Set back 1 replica (and have 2 shards on each server)\r\n\r\nThat's what some people are doing with MySQL (to avoid having to reshard too often and lose availability)\r\n"
