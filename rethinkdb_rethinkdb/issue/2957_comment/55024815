      "- This should fail after one update\r\n```\r\nr.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"table_config\").update({name: \"foo\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI accidentally renamed all my servers to \"foo\". I would expect the server to rename one server then fail to rename others.\r\nIt's quite a pain to then rename your servers...\r\n\r\n\r\n- About `server_status`, my main issues is that we have an array of arrays, and that's really hard to filter/update.\r\nGiven a server name, I want for each table all the shards used by this server.\r\n\r\nFor me the current API works and is better than the previous `/ajax`, but it's still hard to use for a normal user I think."
