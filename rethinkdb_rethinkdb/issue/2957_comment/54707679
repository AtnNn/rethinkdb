      "So having played a bit with the new API, here are a few comments:\r\n- `reconfigure` should take optarg for shards and replicas. I always mixed up which arguments come first. This should allow:\r\n    - to change the number of replicas without resharding\r\n    - not force the user to retrieve the number of shards to add a replica\r\n\r\nLater, if we have time\r\n- `r.table(\"foo\").reconfigure({shards: function(table) { return table(\"shards\").add(1) })` would be pretty neat, but that would require to store function which we currently an't.\r\n- `r.db('rethinkdb').table(\"table_config\").filter({name: \"foo\"}).update({shards: r.row(\"shards\").add(1) })`\r\n\r\n\r\n"
