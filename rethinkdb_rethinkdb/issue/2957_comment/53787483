      "Sorry, I completely forgot about the `issues` table. I think we should do it before stats, and along with `server_status`, `db_config`, and `cluster_config`.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to start working on the Web UI now; I was just worried that it would be quite limiting without, for example, `table_status`. I'll talk to @neumino about it tonight or tomorrow."
