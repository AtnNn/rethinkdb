      "Also, @coffeemug: Where does `rethinkdb.issues` fit into this roadmap? Should it be done with `rethinkdb.server_status`, `rethinkdb.db_config`, etc. before we go over the API with a \"fine-tooth comb\"? Or shoujld it be done after with logs and stats? This is relevant because @Tryneus was planning to work on `rethinkdb.issues` next."
