      "* > Could we have \"num_replicas\" and \"num_shards\" be read-only values? People should use `reconfigure` if they don't want to pin servers.\r\n\r\n    It would be really confusing to have a read-only value in `table_config`. People would ask, \"Why can't I run `r.table_config(\"foo\").update({num_replicas: 4})`?\"\r\n\r\n* Can you give an example document for `server_status`?\r\n\r\n    In an offline discussion, Slava and I decided that the ideal way to handle the `server_status` thing would be (if possible) to improve ReQL so that it's easier to get the data you want from `table_status`. Can you think of an improvement to ReQL that would make this query easier to write?"
