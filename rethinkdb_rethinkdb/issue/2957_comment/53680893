      "Just played with the last set of updates. Everything looks awesome (barring the bug https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2906#issuecomment-53679054).\r\n\r\nHere is what I think we should do next:\r\n\r\n- Implement `rethinkdb.server_status`, `rethinkdb.db_config` (for renaming), and `rethinkdb.cluster_config` (for auth). Play with it.\r\n- Sit down together for a few hours and go through everything again with a fine tooth comb. Finalize all naming, document structures, optarg names, etc. and write it up here.\r\n- Implement the agreed upon spec.\r\n\r\nAt this point we will have removed a significant development bottleneck and people can start working in parallel:\r\n\r\n- @timmaxw @Tryneus -- work on remaining issues/problems for the new clustering API\r\n- @neumino -- update the web ui to work with the new API\r\n- me + someone else (@Tryneus?) -- go through this design process again for stats and logs if appropriate. Ideally we'd drop `/ajax` for good for the full release and have a consistent API for everything.\r\n\r\n@timmaxw -- does that sound reasonable?"
