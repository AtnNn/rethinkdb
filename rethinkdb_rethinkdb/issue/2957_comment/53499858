      "This looks good.  A few comments on the comments:\r\n\r\n> [{ batgirl_local_h4v: 'ready' }, { batgirl_local_q47: 'ready' }]\r\n\r\nThis format looks really strange to me.  I would either do `{ready: ['batgirl_local_h4v', 'batgirl_local_g47'], down: []}` or `{batgirl_local_h4v: 'ready', batgirl_local_g47: 'ready'}`.\r\n\r\n> we should switch back to the term \"master\", but let's ignore that for now\r\n\r\nI think we should do one of two things:\r\n1. Switch back to \"masters\" and \"replicas\", make them be disjoint.  Empirically it's very confusing to people that the master is also a replica.\r\n2. Use a term that makes it clear the sets aren't disjoin, like \"master\" and \"nodes\", or \"primary\" and \"nodes\"."
