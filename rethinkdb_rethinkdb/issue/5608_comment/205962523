      "Thanks for the pull request @binarycrayon . You can close it, since a similar fix already exists.\r\n\r\nThe error happens when trying to turn a cursor into a string (for example for printing). As a work-around, you can convert it into a `list` first if it's small enough, and then print the list instead. Sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe issue that fixed this for the upcoming 2.3 driver was https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5331"
