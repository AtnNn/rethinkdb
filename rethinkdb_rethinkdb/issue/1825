        "@neumino has run some insert benchmarks against Postgres which give us a good set of latency expectations to work off of.\n- The detailed benchmark results are here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah6XjNY9qZqNdHY4Y0sxV3VZTGZ5elJuUWVOZUE5RGc&usp=sharing.\n- The script that generates them is on newton (/home/michel/rethinkdb/benchmark/vsPg.js).\n\nHere are some points of interest:\n- For big documents, we are as fast as PostGres (sometime faster), but for small documents, we are up to 10 times slower.\n- The cost of the first 10 fields (beside the primary key) seems to be huge -- That may be just an accident though, I could try to run the test more than once and do an average.\n\nWe should look into what's going on here when we get the chance.\n"
