        "Queries like `.between([VAL, r.minval], [VAL, r.maxval], index: 'compound')` are pretty unintuitive for people.  We should consider adding a special syntax for it.\r\n\r\nSome proposals:\r\n* Support `.get_all([VAL, r.any])` and transform it into a `between`.\r\n  - This is kinda bad because it's magical.\r\n* Support `.get_prefix(VAL)` (or `.get_prefix([VAL])` would maybe be more consistent) to get all compound index values with a certain prefix.\r\n  - This is less magical, but it's not clear which syntax is less confusing.\r\n  - If we went with the second syntax then we could also have the semantics that `.get_prefix('aaaa')` would get all strings starting with those 4 characters in the index, which might be really useful.\r\n"
