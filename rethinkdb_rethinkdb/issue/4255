        "After #3897 is implemented, our behavior when a server disconnects will be as follows: We will repeatedly try to reconnect to it with an exponential backoff for up to 24 hours. After 24 hours, we will give up.\r\n\r\nWe should do something smarter: If the server is one of the ones that we got with `-j` on the command line, we should keep trying to reconnect indefinitely. Or if it's possible that the server could be hosting a table, we should keep trying to reconnect indefinitely. If we didn't get that server with `-j` and we're sure it's not hosting any tables, we should stop trying to reconnect."
