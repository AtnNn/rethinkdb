        "This is a sub-task of the #3442 umbrella bug, and is the finicky work of moving all of the `./test/rql_test/test-runner` tests from that enclosing folder up a level to `./test` in preparation for the merge with `./test/run`. Mostly this is just going to be a move, but there are a few other things to do:\n1. [ ] update all of the references (typically to `common`) for the new relative path.\n2. [ ] change the `./test/rql_test/src` folder to be `./test/clients` and move the `connection` tests inside that (reduce double-churn in the eventual restructuring of the tests)\n3. [ ] create a `server/changefeeds` folder in `./test/`and move the existing changefeeds tests into there.\n4. [ ] make sure that `test-runner` ignores current `./test/run` folders (especially all the `.test` files in `./test/full_test`)\n5. [ ] update the README files (still separate for `run` and `test-runner`.\n6. [ ] `./test/full_test/ql.test` and `./test/interface/artificial_table.py` need the new path to `test-runner`\n"
