      "That sounds really bad to me.  The terms sent to the server should represent an AST, which should be independent of what people typed to produce it.  We'd end up having two of every term, and some languages (like Clojure or C) would only ever send half of them, then on the server we'd turn them into one \"real\" term.\r\n\r\nI would rather make the server return structured error messages ({type: 'type_error', term: 'add', arg: '3', message: ..., bt: ...}) so that drivers can choose to render them in driver-specific ways (since the driver knows whether you were using infix or postfix notation to generate the AST)."
