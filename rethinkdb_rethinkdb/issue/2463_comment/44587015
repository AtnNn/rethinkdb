      "`r.add(1)` and `r.expr(1).add()` compile to the same query.\r\n\r\nSo if the driver wants to make the distinction between the two notations, it has to build a second \"query\" that keeps track of the notation used, which is cumbersome to do.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'm ok just sending back a structured error message for now. That would make errors way more readable."
