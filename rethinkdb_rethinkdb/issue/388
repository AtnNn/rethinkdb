        "1. Keep history visual state (open/closed) when user goes to a different tab and comes back\r\n2. 'Clear history' doesn't clear, history gets reset when we go to a new tab\r\n3. If I type `r.`, then `ESC`, then `TAB`, it should just show suggestions, not pick one\r\n4. `TAB` after a dot or in the middle of a word, it should do nothing (unless suggestions make sense)\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\n5. If I type `r.`, then `ESC`, then `TAB`, suggestions are broken\r\n6. `TAB` should have the same number of spaces as indentation after `ENTER` (2)\r\n7. `TAB` as tabulation should only work when there's only whitespace to the left of the tab on its string (bonus points if it also works inside a string).\r\n"
