      "This appears not to happen if you just run the JSProc unittests.  Since this is failing on a line that is guaranteeing the `extproc_pool_t` is unique (as it is a singleton), I would suspect that another test is not being cleaned up properly.  This could be a bug in the unittests or elsewhere, but I'm not too worried about it being a problem in the server, we only instantiate the `extproc_pool_t` in one place during startup."
