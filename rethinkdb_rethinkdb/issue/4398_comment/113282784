      "Talked about this with @deontologician and we decided that we shouldn't officially support specific browser versions at the moment, because we don't have the resources to actually test for them.\r\n\r\nI think going with >90% support on caniuse.com in combination with option 5 is good enough for the moment. In addition we should make sure that at least the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer support the features.\r\nOnce we have more resources for testing, we will make the supported browser versions more specific."
