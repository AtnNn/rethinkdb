      "This post about Redis' implementation has a lot of details on how a HyperLogLog data type can be represented and which sorts of operations you can perform on it: http://antirez.com/news/75\r\n\r\nEssentially you can add an element to the \"set\", remove an element, estimate the cardinality, and merge multiple HyperLogLog \"sets\"."
