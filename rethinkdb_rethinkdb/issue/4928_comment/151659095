      "I actually talked with @barakmich, the developer of Cayley, and using this for optimized graph traversal would need a bit more than just a HyperLogLog pseudotype with the associated operators.\r\n\r\nThe gist of it is that we would need to add an index type that automatically maintains HyperLogLog \"counters\" for each index value.\r\nIn other words: It should answer the question\r\n\"What is the cardinality of field `d[x]` over the documents `d` in this table that match the (index) predicate `p(d)`?\""
