      "`THREADED_COROUTINES=1` and parts of [the poor man's profiler](http://poormansprofiler.org/) were enough for my latest need for this.\r\n\r\nI still think it'd be nicer to do it internally, especially if we could make it efficient enough to always enable tracking and then turned into text on-demand, [like the Go runtime does](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/). Debugging stuck jobs and deadlocks (#5223 comes to mind) would be a bit easier, as we'd be able to get a trace of our users' production systems as they hit the issue."
