      "In SQL `COUNT` is a function that takes as an argument `*` or `column_name` or `DISTINCT column_name` (for a couple of databases).\r\n\r\nEven if `r.count` is logical, I'm wondering if people wouldn't actually expect to write `r.count()`. \r\n\r\n - - \9988 - - break - - \9988 - - \r\n\r\nAfter more thinking, I think we should go with `r.count()` as:  `groupBy` accepts as the 2nd parameter a \"reduction_object\" (and not a function reference which is what I'm thinking of when seeing `r.count`)\r\n\r\n"
