      "> I still think it's strange to have r.count without parenthesis when we have r.avg(\"key\") and r.sum(\"key\")\r\n\r\nIt makes a lot of sense if you look at how count and avg are defined and what group_by does (i.e. just takes a reduction). We could make count a function that takes no arguments and always returns the same reduction, but that seems strange to me.\r\n\r\n@al3xandru, @wmrowan  -- what do you think?"
