      "Hmm I can get rid of these crashes by making backfilling enforce the ordering of the erase and insert operations it performs more stringently. I'm definitely going to put that change into code review. (Edit: Actually what that does is just make one backfill transaction happen after another, instead of multiple at once. Probably a red herring, with some actual bug remaining)\r\n\r\nHowever this generally shouldn't cause any corruption.\r\nBut then there is this horrible thing `btree_erase_range_generic()` that it uses. To the extent I understand it, `btree_erase_range_generic()` can easily leave the btree in an inconsistent state. I think this part is broken in general, but I will research it a bit more."
