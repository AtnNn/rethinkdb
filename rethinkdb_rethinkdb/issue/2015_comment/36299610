      "I'm retracting my previous comment about order enforcement. Actually the ordering is enforced just fine. It doesn't guarantee that backfill operations happen one after another, but that should be fine because their acquisition order of the superblock is guaranteed to be correct.\r\n\r\nI've backported the changed backfilling code from #1971 to next before the alt cache was merged. There is no database corruption with the old cache."
