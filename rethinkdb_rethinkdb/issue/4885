        "Hey all. I realize github is not the right place to ask usage related questions, but I haven't had luck posting my question on stackoverflow/freenode IRC channel.\n\nHere is my question:\n\nI have two tables 'tasks' (task_id primary key,....) and finished_tasks (task_id, user_id). I want to select rows in 'tasks' that are not finished by user: user_id.\n\nThis is what I tried but it is giving me an error\n\n```\n r.table('tasks').filter( lambda task : task['id'] \n                not in \n                r.table('finished_tasks').filter('user_id':user_id).pluck('task_id').run().values()).run()\n```\n"
