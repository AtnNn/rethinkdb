        "From IRC:\r\n\r\n> 01:08 < phuh> neumino: Did you know bluebird has .nodeify() that helps simply code like this one? \r\n              https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/ast.coffee#L99-L126\r\n> 01:09 < phuh> documentation says \"There is no effect on peformance if the user doesn't actually pass a node-style callback function.\"\r\n\r\nI've also been thinking about this for a while. I believe `nodeify()` would simply things in that span, and similar spans of the JS driver. `nodeify()` is cool and also provides an easy way to support the callback interface while using `Promise.using()` for a possible connection pool implementation (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/281#issuecomment-49456610)."
