      "Thanks for the explanation @coffeemug \r\nIt was an approximate number, mainly to see the difference (I was doing other requests in the same time)\r\n\r\nHow can I reduce the number of read for this simple query ? I try to get the most recent record that also match the fields minutes_timestamp, server_name, app_name.\r\n\r\nShould I create a secondary index on minutes_timestamp, then do an orderBy + limit(10) and see which record match these 3 fields ?"
