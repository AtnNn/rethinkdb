      "@Unitech -- to elaborate a little my previous answer, the reason why we count reads/writes this way is because just showing the number of queries won't tell you much about the real load on the cluster.\r\n\r\nSome queries require a table scan, while others just require to read one document.\r\n\r\nI thought that it was strange at the beginning too, but in the end, it's more useful to get an idea of the load on your cluster instead of the number of queries it can execute."
