        "I think I have found a typo on the website but not really sure if I'm doing something wrong or not. I have added a user with ID: `test_user` and password: `test_password` according to the docs: https://rethinkdb.com/docs/permissions-and-accounts/\r\n\r\nThe server is running fine and I can access the web interface, however, when I try to connect to it via the JavaScript RethinkDB driver with the following command:\r\n\r\n    var r = require('rethinkdb');\r\n    r.connect({host: 'localhost', port: 28015, db: 'database', user: 'test_user', password: 'test_password'})\r\n\r\nI always get an `ReqlAuthError: Wrong password`-error.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I change `user` to `username` it works fine. So the command that works is this: \r\n\r\n    r.connect({host: 'localhost', port: 28015, db: 'database', username: 'test_user', password: 'test_password'})"
