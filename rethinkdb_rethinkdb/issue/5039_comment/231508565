      "I want to chime back in here just for some more info.\nWhen this happened to us, the web console would \"freeze up\". No updates and\ndoes not show number of tables etc, basically no data, as if it is blocked\nby a lock.\nOvertime, we noticed a trend, and that's if there are a lot of change feeds\nopen, and there are data being written (either delete or update and\nsometimes even on insert ), it would freeze up. This becomes especially\nworse for a large table.\nOne example is we had a notification table that users watch for changes;\nwhen this table went up to size of 10million, all operations on the\ndatabase became sluggish and I had to shutdown the client servers to\ndisconnect from change feed and delete some of the old entries in that\ntable.\nAnother example is updating 5000 records in a table with approximately 100k\ndocuments without clients connected to change feed takes less than 3\nseconds. Whereas if there are 1000 change feed open on that table, it would\ntake a minute.\n\nNot sure if any of this is related but I wanted to provide information just\nin case.\n\nWe didn't actually restart it. It came back online by itself after a few\nminutes. I should also note that the web console continued to load but\ndidn't actually update with any information (like the writes/second, disk\nusage, number of records, etc.). Once Rethink came back online we just\nrestarted the application and kept using the server.\n\nLet me know what kind information, if any, I could provide that would be\nhelpful.\n\n\8212\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n<https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5039#issuecomment-231503154>,\nor mute the thread\n<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/ABQ5w46NWuVccE_V7dKfpxRqkOHD_lkGks5qTu0NgaJpZM4Gb6LP>\n.\n"
