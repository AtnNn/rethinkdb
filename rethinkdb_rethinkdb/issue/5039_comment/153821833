      "Hi @mshi, what hardware are you running on? Is this in a cluster? How big is it and how is the network setup?\r\nDo you know if there's any i/o activity while this is happening (e.g. `iostat -d 1 -m`)?\r\n\r\nHow large is the data set approximately (size of data on disk), compared to the amount of RAM on the machine(s)?\r\n\r\nYou might also want to check the output of `r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs')` the next time this is happening, to find out if there are any background tasks running on the database."
