      "We're really at a loss here. We checked and there are no background jobs running. The IO usage using iostat is very minimal during this. The CPU usage is still overall hovering at around 30%. Total # of reads is less than 80k/s. The strange thing is during this time, the reads are consistently around the same value, hovering around 50k/s to 80k/s on the same table.\r\n\r\nA few days ago we isolated the problem to some oversea servers writing to the database and their connections took a long time to compute and I'm guessing this locked up the available connections. After we removed those servers to isolate the problem, we didn't experience it again, until today.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to check the # of available connections or something similar to find the root of this cause?"
