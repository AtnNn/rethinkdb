      "@mshi You can filter out queries (including change feeds) from the table by running `r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').filter(r.row('type').ne(\"query\"))`.\r\nThat way only background jobs from inside the database will be left.\r\nNone of them should cause a slowdown like this, but maybe they can give us an indication of where to look next."
