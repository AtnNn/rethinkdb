      "We didn't actually restart it. It came back online by itself after a few minutes. I should also note that the web console continued to load but didn't actually update with any information (like the writes/second, disk usage, number of records, etc.). Once Rethink came back online we just restarted the application and kept using the server.\r\n\r\nLet me know what kind information, if any, I could provide that would be helpful."
