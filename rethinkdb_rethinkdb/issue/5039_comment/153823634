      "I'm running on Compute Engine's n1-highcpu-16 type with 16 vCPUs and 14.4GB of RAM. \r\nIt is running in a cluster of one other server, however the tables are not sharded (all production tables are on one server and development database on the other). They exist on the same data center in Compute Engine.\r\nI've monitored the network and CPU usage and none are even close to being saturated. I did not monitor the I/O activity though, I will keep in mind of that next time.\r\nCurrent resource used is 14% cache used 10.9 GB disk used. The machine has persistent SSD.\r\n\r\n`r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs')` will definitely be very useful! What should be looking for in particular? Right now I see a bunch of change feed queries, along with `duration_sec`. What does this number represent?\r\n\r\nAnd what should be the normal number of jobs? When i did `r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').count()`, i see 782 jobs."
