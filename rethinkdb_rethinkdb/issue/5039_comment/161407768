      "@thomasmodeneis thanks for adding your report. Could you check that your server has free memory available, and that it isn't going into swap when this happens?\r\n\r\nYou might also want to run `r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').orderBy(r.desc(\"duration\"))` to identify any long-running queries that might have queued up."
