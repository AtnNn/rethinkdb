      "Yes sorry, `ulimit -a` (I updated my comment).\r\n\r\nWell you can see the read/write throughput for a particular table, either in the `stats` table by looking at documents with IDs `[\"table\", <table_id>]`, or by going to the page for a given table in the web UI.\r\nRethinkDB doesn't actually lock tables, though there can be rare circumstances under high i/o where queries have to queue up. Since i/o is low in your case, I wouldn't necessarily suspect this in your case though.\r\n\r\nDo you have the iops numbers from `iostat` from when the problem was occurring? Even the \"SSD persistent\" disks on Google Compute Cloud aren't the fastest (local storage is a lot faster according to the stats), though I'm not sure if that could lead to the effects you are seeing.\r\n\r\nIs there a chance you could give us access to the servers to debug this? We can sign an NDA if necessary. Please email me to daniel@rethinkdb.com if this is an option for you."
