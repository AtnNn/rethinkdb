      "@deontologician Thanks for pointing that out. However, the purpose of the query was a wildcard lookup for an auto completion field, that is why the match was needed because users looking up does not know the exact match. If there is a better way to do a query like this, please let me know! This was legacy code from another developer and currently my solution is a local in memory datastore and updating the dataset with changefeeds to prevent hits from the database."
