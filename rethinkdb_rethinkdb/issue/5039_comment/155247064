      "@mshi The number of available connections is limited by the operating system's \"open files\" limit.\r\n\r\nYou can find the current value in the output of `ulimit -a`. Note that this limit might be different for the `rethinkdb` process if you're running it as a service on system startup though.\r\nYou can find the limit of the `rethinkdb` process by looking up its PID (`ps ax | grep rethinkdb`), and running `cat /proc/<PID>/limits`.\r\n\r\nThe current number of open connections is available in `r.db('rethinkdb').table('stats').get([\"cluster\"])` in the `query_engine.client_connections` field.\r\n\r\nDo you have logs from your application? I think `rethinkdbdash` usually prints a message if it can't establish a new TCP connection to the server, but I'm not sure."
