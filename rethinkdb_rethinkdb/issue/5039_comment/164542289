      "@thomasmodeneis From the stats it looks like there are a lot of very heavy read queries running concurrently. Only ~0.57 queries complete each second (`\"queries_per_sec\": 0.569267231`), but the read rate is ~70k/sec.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of queries are you running?\r\nIs CPU usage still low when you run into this? How about i/o (`iostat -d 2 -m`)?"
