      "We are also experiencing this on Ubuntu 14.04, AWS i2.xlarge instances, cluster of 3 nodes, and Rethink version 2.3.4. Both network and disk IO are very low during the freezes.\r\nEdit: I went back and was looking at the logs from our application that was writing a high volume of data into the database at the time of the freeze, and it looks like the application is now permanently frozen/blocked starting at around the time of the database freeze. We are using the Java client through a connection pool with a maximum of 20 connections per applications, and we had 3 of these applications running and connected at the time of the freeze. Interestingly, the other 2 applications kept on chugging. The one that is now frozen was writing by far the most data. Hope that sheds a bit more light on the potential problem."
