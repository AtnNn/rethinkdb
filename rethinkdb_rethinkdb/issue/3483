        "Currently `rethinkdb export` runs `r.table(...).count()` and then `r.table(...)`. As it reads documents from the stream returned by `r.table(...)`, it counts the number of documents; then it uses this value as the numerator of the progress fraction, with the result of `r.table(...).count()` as the denominator.\r\n\r\nThis means that the server must traverse the entire data set twice: once to count the number of documents, and again to stream them to the client. For a data set that doesn't fit into RAM, this could make `rethinkdb export` take twice as long as it needs to. Until the first traversal is finished, `rethinkdb export` will report 0% progress.\r\n\r\nWe should consider using a distribution query to estimate the denominator for the progress fraction instead. We can do this by running `r.table(...).info()['doc_count_estimates'].sum()`. This won't give exact results, but it will run in constant time instead of reading the entire table."
