      "Hrmmmm, so this is a launchpad issue?  I realize that being on Maverick, as a lazy maintainer of my system, puts me at a disadvantage (I need to point things to old-releases.ubuntu.com to continue to even use apt-get).  Thanks for the quick response.  I need to upgrade, buy a bigger ssd, and/or switch to a real distro :p like Arch LInux.  In the meantime I'll go back to build from source."
