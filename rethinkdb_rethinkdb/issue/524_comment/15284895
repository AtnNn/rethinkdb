      "Hi @truedat101 -- the reason maverick packages are missing is because Canonical no longer supports maverick and Launchpad refuses to build rethinkdb packages on it (you can see the build log here: https://launchpadlibrarian.net/134506816/buildlog_ubuntu-maverick-amd64.rethinkdb_1.4.0-3ubuntu1~maverick_CHROOTWAIT.txt.gz) We asked the folks at launchpad about it, and they said they're no longer fixing the Launchpad infrastructure for maverick, so there isn't much we can do.\r\n\r\nSorry -- if you'd like to use rethink, you'll have to downgrade to 10.04 or upgrade (it's inconvenient, but it's probably a good idea anyway :))."
