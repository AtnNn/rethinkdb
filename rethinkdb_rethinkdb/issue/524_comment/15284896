      "Unfortunately, this is out of our hands. We build our packages on Launchpad, and Canonical has declared Maverick to be EOL-- currently Launchpad won't build Maverick packages (see: http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2012/04/10/ubuntu-10-10-maverick-meerkat-end-of-life-reached-on-april-10-2012/ and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).\r\n\r\nLucid (10.04) is LTS and will continue to be supported by Canonical through 2015, however, so we will be able to provide builds for Lucid for the forseeable future. You can also try checking out a source package and building it on your system (see http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/build/), which should work on your system.\r\n\r\n@atnnn can weigh in with more details if I've excluded anything. Sorry for the inconvenience!\r\n"
