      "@rokyed We don't provide packages for Linux Mint.\r\n\r\nYou can try one of the Debian or Ubuntu repositories. Take a look at http://download.rethinkdb.com/apt/dists/ to see the supported distributions. Once you have found one that you think will work, you can edit `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/rethinkdb.list` and replace `rebecca` by the matching distribution."
