        "Hey guys! Just installed v1.11.0 and updated my driver, but now the calls using the `GET_ALL` term are returning an array atom type, not a sequence. All my getAll queries expect a cursor/sequence, so it's breaking many places in my app.\n\nIs this expected in the latest release? My driver makes the distinction between arrays/sequences so it trips things up when the types change. Should I just update the driver to convert array atoms into cursors?\n"
