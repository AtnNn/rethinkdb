(~4ms) and 'Perform read.' (14ms) in the profile.\r\n\r\nI had a different query which used getAll and a secondary index to select about 2k similarly structured documents from the database and 'Perform read.' took about 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nA different query which selects a similar number of much simpler documents finishes a lot quicker (in the order of a few hundred milliseconds). So my suspiction is that it has something to do with the structure of the documents.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB version 1.13\r\n\r\n(feel free to change the issue title to be a bit more descriptive)."
