        "We should probably also drop the web browser support in the JS driver, run node inside the rethinkdb server, and port the web UI to send off the queries to the rethinkdb server instead of running them in the browser.\r\n\r\nThis way we can migrate to a fast protobuf library without maintaining two versions of the driver and without rolling a fast protobuf library that works both in node and the browser.\r\n\r\nI'll talk to @wmrowan about it tomorrow."
