      "Somebody could have asked me about this.\r\n\r\nThe rpc .hpp files only become dependencies as a result of DEPS files generated during the build (corresponding to includes in parsed .cc files) and included by reference in the Makefile. It would be difficult to determine what triggered the rebuild in this case.\r\n\r\nI have pushed a change to branch generate_copyrights_1 in order to get the copyright notices into the generated files each time.\r\n"
