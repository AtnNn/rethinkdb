        "I have a use-case where there is a `modified` (time stamp) in all documents of a table. Each time I update a document I also update that `modified` field.\r\n\r\nThing is that when having a changefeed on this table I usually isn't particularly interested in *when* the `modified` field has changed, *but* I'd still like it to be included in the changefeed.\r\n\r\nOf course, a simple work-around is to return the primary key in the query and then do an additional get-query the retrieve the `modified` field.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a simple variant could be to explicitly ignore changes to some fields with an optional argument to `changes()`:\r\n```\r\ntable.pluck('important_info', 'modified').changes(ignore=['modified'])\r\n```"
