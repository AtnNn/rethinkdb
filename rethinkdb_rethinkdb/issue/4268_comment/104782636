      "Indexing by nesting fields doesn't work the way you are trying to do it. You need to use:\r\n\r\n````\r\nr.db('miner').table('tracks').indexCreate('indexName', r.row(\"identity\")(\"key\"));\r\n````\r\n\r\nFor 'indexName' you could use 'identity.key' but realize it is just a string identifier and has nothing to do with the layout of your document. 'identityKey' or anything else would be just as valid.\r\n\r\nMore info available at http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/index_create/"
