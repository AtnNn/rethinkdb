      "```\r\nIt was a cold, dark night, with heavy rain drops pounding the\r\ntrash can covers. Cigarette smoke was rising in the back alley\r\nwhere most of the top Twin Cities detectives were waiting for him\r\nat the crime scene, wrapped in their rain cloaks for hours. A\r\nscreeching noise pierced the grim silence, as his car ripped\r\nthrough the turn at the intersection, covering the last three\r\nhundred yards to the crime scene in less than a few seconds. He\r\nbrought the car to a halt, killed the engine, and stepped out to\r\nmeet the detective team, not even bothering to shut the vehicle's\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"Mug\", he said, looking vehemently at the body. \"Mr. Mug.\"\r\n\r\nThings didn't look good.\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: I'm on it."
