        "We're currently using `-Wswitch-enum -Wswitch-default`, which requires that every switch on an enumeration explicitly mention each enumerated value _even if a default case exists_. Arguably, that's an over-restrictive default.\r\n\r\nIn several places, we do `switch (static_cast<int>(value)) {` to skip these restrictions, which IMO smells bad.\r\n\r\nWe do have certain `switch` statements where we do want _all_ enumerations _and_ a `default` case, and wish to raise errors if this is not the case. The `switch`es on `reql_version_t` and `cluster_version_t` are the main ones, because they need to handle unsanitized input (which is most cleanly done with a `default` case) and also _must_ be updated for every new enumeration we add (figuring out that an enumeration is missing after compilation succeeds is much more painful.)\r\n\r\n@AtnNn, @VeXocide, and I discussed this on a draft code review (CR 3381), and settled on:\r\n\r\n- Switching the compiler warning defaults to `-Wswitch` (removing `-Wswitch-enum -Wswitch-default`)\r\n- Adding preprocessor macros to turn `-Wswitch-enum -Wswitch-default` on for those specific switch statements where they're helpful (@AtnNn made an example: https://gist.github.com/AtnNn/80e931a5d80551210830)\r\n- Auditing all our `switch` statements to make sure that the macros are used when needed and no `static_cast<int>` hacks remain."
