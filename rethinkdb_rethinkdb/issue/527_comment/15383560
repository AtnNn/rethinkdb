      "Thanks for the bug report!\r\n\r\nThis is actually a change in the drivers (I think).  Internally RethinkDB stores everything as double-width floats.  The old driver probably turned floats representing integers into the appropriate native Python type, while the new one doesn't.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug -- should we switch back to the old driver behavior?"
