      "Thanks for the clarification!  It's only annoying because I frequently turn integers into strings, such as when I request an API call with an integer in the URL.  Doing an str() on a float returns \"1234.0\" whereas doing it on an int returns \"1234\" as you would expect.\r\n\r\nAnyways, curious to hear what @coffeemug thinks!"
