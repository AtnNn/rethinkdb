      "Yeah I'm also wondering if there could still be a bug.\r\nI think increasing `max_map_count` will probably work.\r\n\r\nTheoretically RethinkDB tries to stay well below the default vm map limit though. There are certain edge cases where it might exceed its \"goal\", but we assumed that those would not normally happen in practice. This assumption might have been wrong, or there is an issue with the implemented logic.\r\n\r\nEarlier versions of RethinkDB before 2.3.2 were actually using *more* VM maps than RethinkDB 2.3.2. However they were just ignoring failures in this particular part of the code (however there was a high risk that things would still fail the next time RethinkDB needed to allocate memory)."
