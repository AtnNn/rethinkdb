      "I was wondering it this could be a bug on rethinkdb or also the fact that our code in spawing a lot of processes all of them doing queries.\r\n\r\nI increased `max_map_count` and it seemed to have worked. I will run some more tests today an let you know how it goes so that you can close this issue if its not a rethinkdb problem."
