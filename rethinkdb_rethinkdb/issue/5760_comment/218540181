      "Can you check what the current value of `/proc/sys/vm/max_map_count` is? The default is usually 65530.\r\n\r\nThe default value *should* be high enough, but under certain workloads RethinkDB might be using more than the expected number. Do you know if there's anything special about your workload? E.g. a particularly high number of concurrent queries?\r\n\r\nAs a simple work-around, you can increase `/proc/sys/vm/max_map_count` by running `sudo \"echo 131060 > /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count\"` and adding a file in `/etc/sysctl.d` for persisting the change over restarts. As far as I know, increasing the limit shouldn't have any negative side-effects on the system (except that run-away processes get caught slightly later)."
