      "Hi @sctb, sorry you ran into this.\r\nI have a few questions:\r\n* Which version of RethinkDB are you running?\r\n* Does this happen repeatedly every time you run this query?\r\n* Can you send us an example document from the table `\"geo\"`, so we can see what the document structure is like?\r\n* Even better: Is there a chance you can send us the whole RethinkDB data directory with your database? We can sign an NDA if you have any sensitive data in there.\r\n\r\n@gchpaco can you take a look at this?"
