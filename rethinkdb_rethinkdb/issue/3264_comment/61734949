      "Hi @sctb -- a few questions:\r\n* `latest_geo` has the code `nth(0)[\"default\"](false)` in it; what is that meant to do?  As far as I know we can't overload the `[]` operator in JS, so I think that shouldn't work.  Is it meant to be `.nth(0).default(false)`?\r\n* How did you define your `geo` index?  Could you paste the code you used to create it?\r\n* Could you paste the output when starting up RethinkDB?  It should give the exact build, which will help us symbolify the backtrace you provided.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping us track this down, and sorry you ran into it!"
