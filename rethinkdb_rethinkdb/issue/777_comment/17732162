      "This imports successfully for me on newton.\r\n\r\nI notice that there're two files `import.py` and `import.py~` in `brakeman`; maybe that was breaking it for you?\r\n\r\nIf not (and if it works with Python), it's quite possible that this is a problem related to Ruby on OS X (which has caused at least one problem before).  What version of Ruby are you running?"
