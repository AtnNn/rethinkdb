      "Merged into `next` via 4944779 and backported to `v2.3.x` via 3558c75.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this just missed the cut for release 2.3.5. If we do another bug fix release before RethinkDB 2.4.0, this will go into it. Otherwise it will ship with RethinkDB 2.4.\r\n\r\n(I don't think this is a super serious DoS issue, because the ReQL client port should already not be exposed to the public. It also is only an issue on OS X, and most production servers run on Windows or Linux. So we'll wait for the next release to ship this.)"
