      "Hi @pilwon,\r\n\r\nThe change described in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2134 are going to make incremental secondary index construction possible. This is still work in progress though, and we also have to think of how we can expose control over pausing index construction.\r\n\r\nIt also wouldn't be unreasonable to have an option to `indexCreate` that makes secondary index construction deliberately slow by inserting `naps` periodically.\r\nI think this isn't as useful before #2134 because it would mean that we keep the secondary index queue and the cache snapshot around for longer, which has an additional impact on write performance and memory consumption. However after #2134 this would be very reasonable.\r\n\r\n@pilwon to understand better how important this is: do you actually see a significant impact on query performance while the indexes are rebuilt? Secondary index construction already runs at a reduced priority, so its effect on regular queries might be less than what the 100% CPU usage suggests."
