      "Hi @kofalt, thank you for the issue report.\r\n\r\nSo does the build work when you're using `./configure --allow-fetch --fetch all`?\r\n\r\nWe generally don't maintain old point releases in this way.\r\n1.15.3 is already a conservative bugfix-only update to 1.15.0, so it wouldn't make much sense to have a second updated 1.15.0-updated as well.\r\nIs there a special reason for why you need to build 1.15.0 rather than 1.15.3?"
