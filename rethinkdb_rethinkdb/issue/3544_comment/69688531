      "The reason we're doing this is we operate with managed updates - an entire environment (dev, prod, etc) will always use the same byte-identical source of truth until we explicitly make the choice to upgrade. This precludes \"whatever is on someone else's HTTP server today\" methods like apt-get.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this has meant just building on each machine we use, which is the only reason I found out about this problem. I have been considering just hosting alternate tarball downloads, which would be a \"cool to have\" for the main site. On the other hand, RDB builds fast enough to not really mind.\r\n\r\nIf the current policy is to support the latest bugfix release (such as `1.14.x`, `1.15.x`), we shouldn't have any problems bumping the version to follow along. We just haven't happened to need an infrastructure upgrade in the last few months.\r\n\r\nI'll likely close this ticket tomorrow, pending internal discussion about changing our update policy."
