      "I made the appropriate changes to the protobuf file, the Ruby driver and the tests in the `mlucy_4559` branch.  @deontologician, @grey -- could I talk you into doing the changes for the JS driver and the Python driver respectively?  I can do it if you guys don't have time before the release, but there were a few small subtleties in the Ruby driver changes (where to detect `AuthError`, how to do the aliasing for backward-compatibility) that I don't quite trust myself to do properly in the drivers I don't understand as well."
