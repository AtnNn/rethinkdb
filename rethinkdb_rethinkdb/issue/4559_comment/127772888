      "I just checked in some changes to the testing system to make the polyglot test system actually work for this type of test, and it looks like there is some issue in how the JavaScript driver is picking up error types. For instance this is coming up in the `polyglot/changefeeds/edge.js` a few times where one of the new subclasses is not being recorded but rather `RqlRuntimeError` being returned.\r\n\r\nI am fairly certain that the testing system is acting currently now (in this regard)."
