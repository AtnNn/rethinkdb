      "OK, changes are up on josh/4559 . I merged in next since @mlucy 's branch didn't have the fix for #4631 in it. I made a couple of assumptions in places where things weren't completely clear:\r\n\r\n- I added the ReqlClientError as a direct subclass of ReqlError as @danielmewes suggested\r\n- The js driver had a superclass called \"RqlServerError\" that isn't in the new hierarchy, I made it an alias for ReqlRuntimeError since it's all the errors with a backtrace from the server\r\n- @mlucy made Rql -> Reql aliases for all of the error classes, but many of the exceptions only ever existed before on the 2.1 branch, so there's no reason to make them backward compatible in that way. So I only created aliases for `DriverError`, `ServerError`, `RuntimeError`, `CompileError` and `ClientError` since they existed pre-2.1\r\n\r\n"
