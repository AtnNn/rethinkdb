      "Sorry @nighelles  But I've just monitored my tables by querying the `stats` table, `storage_engine.cache.in_use_bytes` field. The numbers always stay the same, never change even while there's almost no read or write. It should release the cache, right? \r\n\r\nAnd more, `htop` from one of the instances shows that the memory (RES column) and CPU always stay very high. Especially the RES column never change.\r\n\r\nI'm using version 2.2.5 inside docker container 1.9.1 in CoreOS v899.15.0\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\nI tried a query on a table which had small cache, and I saw the cache for that table increased, while cache for others decreased. So rethinkdb always hold the cache for every tables when until other tables need more cache? Is that the expected behavior?"
