      "@ntquyen That behavior is expected. After a restart, RethinkDB starts using cache as data is accessed up to the configured cache size (`--cache-size`, by default it takes half of the available RAM minus 1 GB. You can also find the current limit in the `server_status` table). Like you say, the available cache is then distributed between tables based on a least-recently-used eviction strategy (i.e. tables that are used less frequently will typically end up with a smaller share of the cache size)."
