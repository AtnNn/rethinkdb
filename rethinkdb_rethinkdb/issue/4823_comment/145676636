      "Unfortunately not (at least for reporting sake). The only change we've made internally is disabling a script that had a couple of constant running change-feeds, for monitoring purposes.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the disabled script was performing the following queries:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.connect(config.rethinkdb).then(function(c){\r\n\tr.table(\"stats\").filter(r.row(\"id\")(0).eq(\"cluster\")).changes().run(c)\r\n\t.then(function(cursor){\r\n\t\tcursor.each(function(err, item){\r\n\t\t\tio.to('stats').emit(\"rethink_stats\", item);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\tr.table(\"server_status\").changes().run(c)\r\n\t.then(function(cursor){\r\n\t\tcursor.each(function(err, item){\r\n\t\t\tio.to('stats').emit(\"rethink_servers\", item);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n```\r\nwhere `io` is a socket.io server. We highly doubt this was causing any issues, but it hasn't been enabled since reporting this issue, and is the only real thing we've changed internally.\r\n\r\nSorry I don't have any further information, but we're glad the issue has stopped occurring!"
