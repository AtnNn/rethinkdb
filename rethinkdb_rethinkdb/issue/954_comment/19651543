      "So I forked bootstrap. I just changed 4 lines for this reason:\r\nOn http://lesscss.org/:\r\n(~\".myclass_@{index}\") { ... selector interpolation is deprecated, do this instead .myclass_@{index} { .... This works in 1.3.1 onwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nI upgraded our Handlebars runtime version to 1.0.0 final, which match the 1.0.12 version in node.\r\nI didn't see any problem (I tested all the views, the operations and issues). The helpers (including the backfilling one) work fine.\r\n\r\nCode review 646 assigned to @mglukhovsky and @atnnn.\r\nBranch michel_954_update_dependencies"
