      "> Is there a reason we decided not to implement this?\r\n\r\nThe reason was that we didn't have a stable way to represent the index function.\r\n\r\nWe now provide an interface for getting a binary representation of the function through `index_status(...)['function']`. I'm not sure how many guarantees we can give about its stability across versions.\r\n\r\nI think we should extend the format a little such that it contains the ReQL version of the index (if it doesn't already). That way we can detect index functions that are too old and reject them on import.\r\nOnce we have that this should be pretty straight-forward."
