Will be in release 1.16.\r\n\r\nFor reference:\r\n * `rethinkdb export` (and thus `rethinkdb dump`) now includes the secondary index information from `index_status` in the `table.info` file.\r\n * `rethinkdb import` and `rethinkdb restore` will create the indexes for the tables being imported if they are available in the data files, unless `--no-secondary-indexes` is specified."
