      "You can clone secondary indexes with external [tools](https://github.com/internalfx/thinker). It currently doesn't write to a file, but maybe I should add that.\r\n\r\nI can't really help with building the database, but perhaps the RethinkDB community can further the project by building its own tools for devops. This frees time for the main developers to focus on the core product.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this, I think I will focus on making [thinker](https://github.com/internalfx/thinker) have the ability to dump to a file (with secondary indexes, of course :wink: )."
