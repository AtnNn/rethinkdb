      "After about 2 days, 113GB and 254M documents the performance did not degrade any further, still averaging about 1K inserts per second. Any query that involves going through the whole dataset like a count() or a sum() or avg() will of course get a timeout and not finish, the .nth() queries only finish up to the 10M th document (and take 40s when done after a couple of times because something probably gets in the cache), the .get() queries gladly work everytime although not consistently with sub-millisecond timing, going up to 10ms every other time."
