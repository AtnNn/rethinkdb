      "@Tryneus: that was an example. In my actual code, I have a more complicated reduction function, and I want errors from it to be thrown because they are actual errors I would need to fix.\r\n\r\n@mlucy: I have been using `.union([base])`. Unfortunately it breaks on grouped streams. It turns them into grouped data.\r\n\r\nI like your `if_empty` idea a lot."
