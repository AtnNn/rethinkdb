      "Can we change our policy to allow changing issue titles when there are obvious mistakes in them?\r\n\r\nTo fix #1070, rethinkdb deletes the data directory if it is unable to initialize it after having created it.\r\n\r\nI believe that what is happening here is that If the `--daemon` option is passed, the rethinkdb process forks, and one of the processes thinks the directory is not initialised, so it deletes it."
