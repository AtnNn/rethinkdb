      "Ahhh. @Tryneus -- I think this is in your court. (Unfortunately this is a high priority since people are running into this in 1.7.2).\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to call `rethinkdb create` directly in the `init.d` script. What do you guys think?\r\n\r\n@atnnn -- we can't change the policy, but we can change this issue title ;)"
