      "Dammit, just an oversight for the daemon option, got a fix.  Basically, the directory lock was shared by the daemon process and the parent process, and when the parent process went to exit, its directory lock believed the directory was still uninitialized and removed it.  This causes the daemon process to fail on stuff when the directory disappears under its feet.\r\n\r\nFix is up in code review 745."
