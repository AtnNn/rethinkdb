      "@AtnNn I see commas without a space after, keywords with spaces around the `=`, strings that can be compile time joined, and relative imports are discouraged. The driver is currently consistent with one empty line between top level statements, where two lines are called for.\r\n\r\n@mlucy for ReQL queries I use the following that looks Pythonic enough to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n    r.table('...').group('...').map(\r\n        lambda x: x\r\n    ).reduce(\r\n        lambda x, y: x\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\nThat can be chained without sacrificing readability for me. Also, I write in all 3 driver languages and that form converts between them well."
