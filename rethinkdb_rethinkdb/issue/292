        "The spacing between the query input and resultset is a problem for users with small monitors (e.g. on laptops). Here is a set of changes that I propose to minimize this issue:\r\n\r\n1. Move the \"full view\" button above the edit box and make it be an icon instead of a button.\r\n2. Move the message that reports how long the query took to execute right below the query edit box (at the same height as the \"clear\" and \"execute\" buttons)\r\n3. Remove the heading \"results\"\r\n4. Merge the two sections into one\r\n\r\n@neumino @mglukhovsky -- what do you think?"
