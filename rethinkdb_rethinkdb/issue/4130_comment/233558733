      "I'm trying to port this software to FreeBSD. Luckily, thanks to @hungte's patches, all the work was significantly easier, lots of defines and a few reimplementations here and there. Anyway, now the codebase compiles, i'm still struggling with the assumption that make is gnu make, as said above, especially on the dependencies, some of them unfortunately require compile from sources, either way because the ports are not enough recent (for example, V8 javascript engine). As soon as i can get to fully build and test if it works, i will commit a patch, if you are interested to add FreeBSD compatibility. "
