      "I'm considering making a FreeBSD port. The biggest build issues with it as it stands is that the configure script doesn't take advantage of pkg-config when present (which would remove many portability issues to not only FreeBSD but many other OSs) and assumes that `make` is GNU make. There are some issues where clang will stop compilation with -Werror on too, which ought to be merged into upstream anyway.\r\n\r\nSome of these issues appear to be fixed in @hungte's patch, but the changes could do with being generalised. Some of the changes (such as the use of pkg-config when available, and fixes for issues flagged by clang) could certainly be merged upstream, which would help with general RethinkDB portability. Others could be maintained in the port where it makes sense."
