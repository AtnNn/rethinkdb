      "Hi @RaitoBezarius , I think the build system is the smallest problem for making this work actually. The code itself will need some changes too (mostly things in the `src/arch` hierarchy).\r\n\r\n@hungte made RethinkDB compile on FreeBSD a while back, and you might find his patches to be a good starting point if you want to give it another shot https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/688 . The patches will probably need a few adaptions to our current code base.\r\nIf you're on IRC,  feel free to drop by in #rethinkdb on freenode for any questions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we don't have the capacity at the moment to work on a fully supported FreeBSD (or other *BSD) port."
