        "I would like to have something that allows me to create unique ids for rethinkdb. There are a few ways it works i could just call it and it will give me just an id. if i call it from a table then it makes sure its unique with in that table. or maybe it does not? Also easy to get a large number of them if needed. If you like the rethinkdb id and want to tag your inserts with an id that you will know before hand this would be a great feature."
