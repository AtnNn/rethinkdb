      "@Tryneus Didn't we run into the security issue in libcurl a while ago because it kept an unvalidated SSL connection in the cache, and then re-used it for a later request that had validation enabled? Did we change things since then or could there be a different reason for why connections aren't re-used?\r\n\r\n@encryptio on which platform did you test this? There might be differences between curl on OS X and on Linux."
