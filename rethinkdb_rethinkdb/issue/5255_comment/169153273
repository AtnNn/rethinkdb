      "It shouldn't be too hard to reuse the same `CURL *` handle across `r.http` requests in each extproc.  This should allow libCURL to leverage its connection cache as long as there are few enough external servers being contacted (which should probably be true for a majority of workloads).  We need to be careful to not leak settings from one request to the next, though."
