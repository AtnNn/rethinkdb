      "@danielmewes - I can reproduce this on `newton`, I have a branch that fixes this (in the way I described in my last post) that is almost ready for review.  The libcurl security issue we ran into only existed on OSX and has been fixed since.  I don't see any reason why we shouldn't enable the connection cache.\r\n\r\nWithout the change, I can make a simple `range.map(r.http)` query result in thousands of sockets in the `TIME_WAIT` state.  With the change, it never goes above 1, with the added benefit that throughput should be higher."
