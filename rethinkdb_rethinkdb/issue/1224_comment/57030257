      "`r.literal` appears in the docs, and `r.desc` appears in `order_by`, so I think we're good here.\r\n\r\nThe pages for `asc`/`desc` will redirect to `order_by` once https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/pull/528 makes it in master. The terms `desc`/`asc` will automatically appear in the data explorer if at some point we decide to write a whole page for them."
