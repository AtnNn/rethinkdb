      "This turned out to be a really old bug in the btree code, that could cause memory and/or data corruption in certain (usually rare) corner cases.\r\nIt's quite embarrassing that we've had this serious bug around for such a long time. At the same time I'm glad that we found it, thanks to your help @soplakanets .\r\n\r\nIt's possible that some fixes to our leaf node timestamp handling in RethinkDB 2.1 have made the problem surface more easily.\r\n\r\nWe will push out a bug fix release as quickly as possible."
