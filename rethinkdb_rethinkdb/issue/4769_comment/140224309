      "Hi Adrien (@Bacto), thanks for the report.\r\nHave you had this table before you upgraded to 2.1.3?\r\nIf that's the case case, the crashes are probably consistent with the sort of corruption that this bug could have caused. The corruption would probably have happened before the upgrade, and only showed when you tried to delete all documents after upgrading to 2.1.3.\r\n\r\nCould you make a copy of the rethinkdb data directory on the server that's experiencing the crash, after you've shut down the rethinkdb process on that server? I'd like to take a look at the data file to confirm that this isn't a different bug if possible. I can send you instructions on how to upload the data.\r\nOnce you've made a copy, I recommend dropping the table and recreating it from scratch in order to avoid the crash in the future."
