      "@danielmewes No I did not store any geospatial data whatsoever. I had a total of 3 tables, they contained ~5k, ~100k, ~2M documents each. They were very basic fields with numbers and strings. In the table with 5k documents, one of the fields contained an array with 10 elements. In the same 5k table, I used a compound secondary key consisting of 2 fields, and a few other basic secondary keys."
