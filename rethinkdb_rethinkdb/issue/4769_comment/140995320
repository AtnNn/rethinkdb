      "@Bacto Is that with the existing table? Unfortunately the patch isn't usually able to revert corruptions that have already happened, and that found their way to disk. It appears that this is the case here.\r\nUnfortunately you'll have to recreate the table again.\r\n\r\nWith your data file, we can attempt to recover most of the data (I suspect that only a small number of documents will be corrupted). Please let me know if you had important data in the table that you would like to have recovered, and I'll see to get you the intact data by tomorrow.\r\n\r\nMy apologies again for all the inconvenience."
