      "The likely fix for this shipped with RethinkDB 2.1.3.\r\nWe strongly recommend everyone to upgrade as quickly as possible, to avoid potential data corruption problems.\r\n\r\n@soplakanets It's always a bit difficult with these hard-to-reproduce bugs to know for sure whether a given patch actually fixed the issue. I recommend upgrading to 2.1.3, but to still keep an eye on the issue to make sure it doesn't appear again (your workload seems to be particularly prone to exposing this bug)."
