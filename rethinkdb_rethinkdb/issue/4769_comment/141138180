      "@oldlam Thanks for mentioning that and for the steps to reproduce. On Linux I'm not getting the seg fault with those queries, but the changefeed isn't properly working either. It looks like there's a bug that yields different types of failures on different systems.\r\n\r\nI think this is a separete bug though. I copied your report over to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4850"
