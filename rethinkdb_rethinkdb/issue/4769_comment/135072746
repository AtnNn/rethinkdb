      "This is very concerning for obvious reasons, and we would like to find out how this happened as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n@soplakanets It would be extremely helpful if we could get a copy of your data files. We are happy to sign an NDA if there's any sensitive data in there.\r\n\r\nI recommend taking the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Find out the id of the affected table: `r.db(...).table(...).config()` shows you the table id in the `id` field of the result\r\n2. Shut down the rethinkdb server\r\n3. Copy the following two files from the RethinkDB data directory to a different location: The file `metadata` and the file that has the id of the affected table as its filename.\r\n4. Delete the file with the table id. This is so you can avoid further crashes when accessing the table. After restarting, the table file will be recreated as an empty table (since you ran a `table.delete()` when this happened, I assume this is fine?)\r\n5. Restart the server\r\n\r\nI'll send you a separate email with information on how to best upload the data files to us."
