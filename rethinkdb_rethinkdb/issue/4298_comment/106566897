      "Thanks for investigating and suggesting possible improvements. However your suggestion doesn't apply in this case:\r\n\r\n* `crash` is a macro, not a function. Any signal handler could safely call it if it was reentrant and thread-safe.\r\n* The linux man page lists a lot more async-signal-safe functions than the CERT style guide: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html\r\n* `crash` never returns, it should be safe to call some non-reentrant functions."
