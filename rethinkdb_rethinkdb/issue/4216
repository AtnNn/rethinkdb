        "On the table page in the web UI, we currently list all secondary indexes.\n\nI think it might be a good idea to show the primary index as well (though without a `delete` link). This will improve discoverability for the fact that the primary index can be used in indexed operations instead of a secondary one (compare e.g. https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/738 ).\n\nA disadvantage I can see is that it makes the list inconsistent with the `indexList` ReQL term. I'm not sure if that's a big problem or not.\n"
