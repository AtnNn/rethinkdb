Should this query fail? I can see good uses for this kind of subquery in changefeeds where you really don't care if the subquery changes, but for things like this presence example, it's pretty surprising behavior.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat related to #3997, being a self-join.\r\n\r\nPinging @mlucy and @danielmewes."
