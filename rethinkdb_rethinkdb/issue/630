        "While working on #587 I tried moving the API documentation out of the `test/` folder. I thought maybe I could put it in `docs/` but I found that:\n- The documentation in `docs/` is outdated.\n- A lot of the documentation in `docs_internal/' is outdated.\n- `assets/` just contains an old riak script.\n- `bench/` and `scripts/` have a lot of things that may be bitrotted.\n- `demos/` has an outdated demo that uses equi_join().\n- `lib/` has some unused libraries.\n- `web_demo/` has a large Makefile and not much else.\n- `rqljs/`, the javascript server, is starting to bitrot.\n"
