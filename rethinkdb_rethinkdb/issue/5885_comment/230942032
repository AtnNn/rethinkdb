      "@contra Regarding the `limit` issue. That's interesting. Does it hit the arrayLimit with the query as listed here or is that with an additional `filter` after each `getIntersecting`? If you get a chance to try it, it would also be interesting to know if the `union` variant has the same issue.\r\nI would expect that even the `concatMap` version will work with the `limit` without hitting the `arrayLimit` though. We might be missing some optimization here."
