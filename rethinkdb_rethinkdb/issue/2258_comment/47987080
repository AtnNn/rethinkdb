      "Unfortunately some parameters *must* have a fixed range because code will behave incorrectly if the range is exceeded. Which ones is what we have to check before exposing the options.\r\n\r\nThe document inlining one is a good example. We store the length of an entry in a single byte to conserve space in the leaf nodes. After accounting for a few special values, 250 bytes remain as the actual the largest document that can be technically inlined. Allowing for larger values would require bigger changes in the code. There are other assumptions baked into how things work. If you adjust parameters in certain ways, the code will stop working and either crash or corrupt data."
