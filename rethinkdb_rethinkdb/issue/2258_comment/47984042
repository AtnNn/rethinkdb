      "We have a lot of internal parameters which are tuned for \"typical\" workloads (just look at src/config/args.hpp for some examples). However as described in @wojons original post, in certain scenarios performance could be improved significantly if those parameters were exposed.\r\n\r\nExposing configuration options is work because\r\n\r\na) We have to provide a convenient interface for setting the parameters. Some parameters should be configurable on a per-table level, others on a per-machine level. Ideally this wouldn't work through command-line options, but the parameters would be configurable on the cluster level through some administration interface. We might want to keep this in mind when designing the new cluster management API #2169, though its initial focus will be a different one (not on performance tuning, but high-level cluster configuration).\r\n\r\nb) We have to look at each parameter and determine reasonable ranges in which things don't break. We should ideally do additional testing with a variety of configurations to make sure things don't break when changing a parameter.\r\n\r\nc) We have to document everything\r\n\r\nSo this is obviously a long-term project, which we should tackle when all the major features and reliability issues have been worked out."
