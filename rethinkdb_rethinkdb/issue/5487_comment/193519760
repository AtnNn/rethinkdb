      "I hope I understand this correctly.\r\n\r\nI think storing the timezone offset with `LocalDateTime` is the right thing to do. The data stored in the database has to represent the same time no matter what the locale of the Java client is. That is the current offset of the current locale should be encoded explicitly in the ReQL DataTime in terms of a timezone.\r\n\r\nAlso pinging @deontologician ."
