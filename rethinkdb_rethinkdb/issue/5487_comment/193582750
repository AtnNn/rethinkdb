      "@danielmewes thans for your explain.\r\n@deontologician These types are all Java 8 new types.\r\n\r\nLocaDate is saved without timezone, but LocalDateTime saved WITH timezone. So one of them is wrong?\r\n\r\nCurrently it seems nobody use LocaDate yet, javaers use LocalDateTime in most case, so this is not a big problem.\r\n\r\nIf no one is interested on this trivial problem, i will close this issue.\r\n\r\n"
