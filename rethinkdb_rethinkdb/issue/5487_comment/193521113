      "Imagine you have two clients A and B and both have different locales (e.g. they are running in different countries). If client A inserts a `LocalDateTime` object into RethinkDB, and client B then retrieves it from the database, the time should be adapted to describe the same actual time in the local time zone.\r\n\r\nThe alternative I guess would be to convert `LocalDateTime` objects to UTC and to always store them at `timezone: \"+00:00\"` in RethinkDB. Then they would need to be converted back to the local timezone when being read back (which we need to do in either case)."
