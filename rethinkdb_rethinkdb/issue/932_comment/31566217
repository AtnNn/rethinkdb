      "The issue your running into is with google protobuf library. It has a fixed limit of 64M for security and performance reasons[1] .  Typically this isn't an issue for single documents since its fairly common to limit them ( MongoDB limited to 16MB, Riak limited to 64MB due to the use of proto bufs) However interaction limits are typically much higher ( MySQL is 1G, and PostgreSQL is a massive 2G, I can't find the limits on the other systems ) If I want to pack multiple objects into a single interaction to do a bulk insert I am limited to a total of 64MB per interaction. \r\n\r\n1. https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/cpp/google.protobuf.io.coded_stream#CodedInputStream.SetTotalBytesLimit.details"
