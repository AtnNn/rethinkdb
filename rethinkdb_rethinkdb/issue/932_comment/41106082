      "We are switching to a JSON based internal protocol, which means that we don't have to go through Google's protocol buffer library anymore.\r\n\r\nWe have to decide what the per-request limit for the new protocol should be. @dkhenry Which limit do you think would be large enough? 128 MB? 512 MB? 1 GB?\r\n\r\nIt would probably be ok to set it to something very large (e.g. 1 GB). The only risk is that malicious users of e.g. a web service might be able to generate huge database requests which would cause excessive memory consumption on the server, making it easier to perform a DoS attack.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus @coffeemug @mlucy Any thoughts on this?"
