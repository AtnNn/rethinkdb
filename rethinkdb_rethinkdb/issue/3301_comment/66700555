      "The requirement is to use an index and the between( ) function call to reliably find a name in a variety of languages in UTF8.   Maybe some interim workaround is available where the binary UTF8 and the collation is submitted to the engine for ordering purposes.\r\n\r\nThat way, it would be application dependend on the interpretation of the raw bytes.\r\n\r\nIn reality, there are just very focused areas that need proper utf-8 storage and utf8 query support.  Generally the only reason is Name search and City Search.  \r\n\r\nSo during the discussions, maybe talk about a low-impact approach instead of a complete fork lift upgrade to get some sort of UTF8 support.\r\n\r\n"
