      "@gchpaco has implemented a UTF-8 validation step which we are going to perform on user-provided strings (but not on results of ReQL computations, such as when applying `split` to a Unicode string, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2518).\r\n\r\nSo there will still be ways to store illegal UTF-8 data in a table by applying `split` (and possibly some other string manipulation operations), but it will catch the most common case where users insert data that's in a different encoding."
