      "> if we normalize before comparing, then people may be surprised if they compare in application code and get a different answer.\r\n\r\nThey would also be confused if their application code was doing \"correct\" Unicode comparison and we were just comparing bytes.  We have to pick some definition of how strings compare, and whichever one we pick the user might pick a different one, so we might as well pick the correct one."
