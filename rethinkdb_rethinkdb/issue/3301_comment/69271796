      "@mdmdmdmd collation is on the menu, in a more localized form (the current state of the discussion is a secondary index with an attached collation locale that you query against).  @tracker1 that would involve some sort of normalization, although I shie away from NFK* for most applications.  This particular ticket, as I understand it, was merely to stop us accepting/emitting junk.  If you want to store random bytes in your database, we have `r.binary` for that."
