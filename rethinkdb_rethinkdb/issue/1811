        "When something goes wrong with cluster configuration and the user attempts to do a query, they get a `master not available` error. For users unfamiliar with RethinkDB, this error message gives them no useful information or even a hint as to what's wrong.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of better options I can think of:\r\n\r\n* Include the offending issue into the error message. I.e. \"Master not available, machine XXX-YYY-ZZZ-WWW is unreachable.\"\r\n* If including the issue itself is too hard, we can try to improve the message itself and possibly give a hint about what to do. E.g. \"Master not available, check the admin console for unresolved issues.\"\r\n"
