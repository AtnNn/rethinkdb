      "@coffeemug it's very hard to click resolve issues button, web interface fails to (re)connect to backend. I've restarted all instances and had a chance to see interface for a few seconds. Screenshot is attached.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes I'll build from source and see what happens. Thanks for the update.\r\n\r\n![rethinkdb administration console 3](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/655413/1498812/86f7d2ce-4844-11e3-8ebc-49a613545c8d.png)\r\n"
