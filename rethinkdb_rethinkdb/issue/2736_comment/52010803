      "I would be definitely in favor of making the default return arrays. 100% of the time in our app we call `.toArray()` on the cursor. I don't know when you would want to only fetch the first X results from a cursor. Pagination maybe?\r\n\r\nThough I think this has a lot to do with connection pools (#281)\r\n\r\nWhen using a cursor, it is hard to know when the connection can be released, though the story there is unclear and it is hard (for me) to follow the discussion in #281. Most rethinkdb pool libraries automatically convert a cursor to arrays already, see e.g. https://github.com/hden/rethinkdb-pool/blob/runner/src/index.coffee#L34-L35"
