      "For the web UI we use gzip compression to the browser, which might reduce the network traffic compared to the node.js client (or any other client).\r\n\r\nAre there a lot of queries and/or large queries (e.g. many inserts)? That might drive up the network traffic for reading the `jobs` table considerably. Though you say that all of your app servers connect through proxies, so I'm not sure what's causing the network traffic. Are you still getting some results from the changefeed? Or is the `jobs` table essentially empty?\r\n\r\nThe original post was specifically about the issue that queries run through proxies do not show up in the table."
