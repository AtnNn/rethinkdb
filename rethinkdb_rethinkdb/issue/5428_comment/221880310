      "Actually, maybe scratch my post above. It seems that running `r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').changes()` *hugely* increases network traffic between nodes.\r\n\r\nIf I run it on our production setup of 3 nodes + 1 proxy, the network usage on the proxy goes up from 0.5~1.0MB/s to ~3.5MB/s (not Mbps), and the usage on server nodes goes from about 2MB/s combined, to about 3~3.5MB/s combined.\r\n\r\nAll of our app servers connect through the proxy, so they don't even show in the changefeed. Is this related at all to anything in your original post? Should I file a new ticket for this, or is it a known behavior?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Also, it seems that running it from a Node.js server had a bigger impact on the network usage than running it from the web UI. Or it's just some weird coincidence and I'm just seeing things."
