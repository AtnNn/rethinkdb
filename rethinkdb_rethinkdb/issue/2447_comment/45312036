      "The user wouldn't even have to type `toArray`. Just the following is enough to force evaluation to the end:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table(\"data\").insert(\r\n  r.http(\"https://api.com\", {depaginate:\"link-header\"})\r\n).run(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I would set the `page-limit` to 1 if the user set `depaginate`, just to let them know that their `depaginate` function works.\r\n\r\nThat seems bad because they'd get more data, but not all, and wouldn't know why. If we want to be safe, I think throwing if `page` is set but `page-limit` is better.\r\n\r\nWhat if we put a big warning on `page` docs to tell the user they might blow through their API limits? They'd have to read the docs to find out how `page` works (or that it exists) and see the warning then. Do you think that would be enough?\r\n\r\n"
