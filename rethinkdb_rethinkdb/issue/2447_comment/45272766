      "One other thing: A function that takes three arguments seems sort of bad here, because it will be tricky to remember what they are.  Do you think it would be better or worse to instead take one argument, which is an object with three fields?  (So instead of `lambda p,h,b: { 'url': h['link']['rel=\"next\"'] }` it would be `lambda res: {'url': res['header']['link']['rel=\"next\"']}`.)"
