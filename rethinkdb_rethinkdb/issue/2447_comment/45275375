      "> I am concerned that other names will not be very clear.\r\n\r\nI agree, but I'd like to find something better than `depaginate`. What about `page` (as a verb) and `page-limit`? That seems hard to confuse once you know what it does and is relatively easy to guess at what it does too.\r\n\r\n> I am thinking we should rename `link-header` to `link-next`\r\n\r\nI'm on board with that, that seems better.\r\n\r\n> If we allow `False`, then we would have to allow `True`\r\n\r\nHow about just allowing `null`? I agree that passing `true` can be confusing, but I think if we rename it to `page` then passing `{ page: 'link-next' }` is short enough that it will work in interactive context.\r\n\r\n> If you guys like it, it's easy enough to do.\r\n\r\nLet's do it. After thinking about it for a bit, I think it's better."
