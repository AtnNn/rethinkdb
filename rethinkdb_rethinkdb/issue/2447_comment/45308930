      "The main use of `r.http` is to quickly dump data in the server right? In which case, I can totally imagine someone do something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table(\"data\").insert(\r\n  r.http(\"https://api.com\", {depaginate:\"link-header\"}).coerceTo(\"array\")\r\n).run(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would take some time before it returns, and they will think that the API server is just a little slow and wait some time before killing the query/script. And while they wait, we hammer the API server with requests.\r\n\r\nI would set the `page-limit` to 1 if the user set `depaginate`, just to let them know that their `depaginate` function works."
