      "I prefer the idea of erroring if `page` is set, but `page_limit` is not.  Depagination is not a trivial feature to use, and I think forcing the user to think about how many pages they are willing to get is a good idea.  If we set the default to `1`, they would have to set it every time anyway.  If we set the default to `-1`, we will likely get some very pissed off users.  If we set the default to `0`, people will be confused as to why it isn't working."
