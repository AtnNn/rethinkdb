      "So, this isn't as bad as it seems because they'll get a (lazy) cursor that will only paginate when they iterate through a batch. There are some pathological cases though (like if they run `toArray` or add `.count()` to the query, or anything that forces the whole thing to evaluate).\r\n\r\n@neumino -- do you think the default `page-limit` should be set to `0` or `1`? That would help with blowing the API limits, but would be annoying too (they'd set `page` to `link-next` and then pagination still won't work because of the limit, but they won't know since they won't necessarily read the docs :smile:)\r\n\r\nWe could also force them to set `page-limit` explicitly if they set `page` (by erroring if it's not explicitly set). I'd be ok with that, though it makes interactive use a bit more annoying. What do you think?"
