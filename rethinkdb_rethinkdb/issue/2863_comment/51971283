      "I propose that we don't show split points in `rethinkdb.table_config`, but instead add an API call `table_rebalance`. It rebalances a table using new auto-generated split points. If a table gets too out of balance, we show the user an issue suggesting they call `table_rebalance` and warning that they will lose availability.\r\n\r\nBoth of @larkost's use cases could be handled by letting the user specify manual split points as an additional parameter to `table_rebalance`. However, I'm not sure if this is actually necessary. There's a hypothetical future feature we've been tentatively calling \"zones\" that handles the same datacenter issue, but better. And I would rather not expose a new user-facing feature just for testing purposes."
