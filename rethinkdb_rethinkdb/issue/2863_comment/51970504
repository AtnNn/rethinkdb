      "I totally agree that most users are never going to care about what the split points are, just that they do a good job of distributing the data. However there are some uses for having the ability to manually specify split points.\r\n\r\nThe example I have in mind is to compliment the 'datacenter' idea[1], and that is to have Asian data (as designated by a customer specific primary key scheme) have its primary shards in Asia, etc... So as long as we let people control the primary key, and don't have another way of causing primary shards to be in a specific place, that is at least one reason to keep the ability to manually set them.\r\n\r\nThe other one is more selfish on my part: for testing I need to be able to know that I have data on both sides of a split point. I can work around this the other way (as longs as I can get the points), but manually setting them does make that predictable."
