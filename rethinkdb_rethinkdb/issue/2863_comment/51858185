      "I think @larkost had to deal a few weeks ago with the internal serialization format of split points, and it wasn't nice at all.\r\n\r\nI used it in the web interface, but the current implementation is a bit broken when high unicode characters get in. There is no reason for users/the web interface/tests to do the work.\r\nThe burden of implementing `unprint_primary` should be done once on the server instead of multiple times by others."
