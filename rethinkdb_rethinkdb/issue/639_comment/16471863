      "Fixed in sam_639, review 399 currently in progress.\r\n\r\nThe fix (in lieu of refactoring all of the tcp conn and event handling layer) is to wake up read and write watchers whenever an error condition happens.  This is a good choice because they should be able to handle spurious wakeups anyway (and they *are* able to do so -- you just make your system call and get the error or success or EAGAIN).\r\n\r\n"
