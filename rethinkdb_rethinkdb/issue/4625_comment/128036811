      "I don't think we want to give more information to `on_close()`, because if `on_close()` simply resumes a fiber, it's not going to help, because it won't know what the resumed fiber might do.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you don't want to allow new queries, maybe we could raise in `em_run()` with a EM shutdown error or something."
