      "@nviennot -- what case is causing that error to occur?\r\n\r\nI'm a little wary of this change.  If something is getting added to `@waiters` while we're iterating over it and closing everything, that suggests that with the new code something will get added to `@waiters` during the iteration and just never be told that the connection is closed."
