      "That third line of the proposal was meant to read\r\n```\r\nGROUPED_SEQUENCE.ungroup('foo', 'bar') => {foo: ..., bar: ...}\r\n```\r\nright (the name of the reduction field would become bar)?\r\n\r\nThis sounds good. Positional arguments also sound good. I can't think of anything else that one would expect an argument to `ungroup()` to be, and the fact that the names are strings will also make it easy to add opt args (for different purposes) later since we can distinguish them easily."
