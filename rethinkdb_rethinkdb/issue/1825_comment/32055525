      "There is another script on newton (/home/michel/rethinkdb/benchmark/variance.js)\r\n\r\nThe results are here:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak399o5bIRrydGRpTUhET0FydTlFVmc0NFQzX1pFQUE#gid=0\r\n\r\nColumns prefix with pg means that it's PostGreSQL results\r\nColumns not prefix with pg means that it's RethinkDB results\r\nColumns ending with c means it's the client results (how long we took to send all the queries)\r\nThen it's mean, min, max, and standard deviation (sig)\r\n\r\nThere are a few strange things, but overall we are slower than PG for small documents, faster for big documents and our clients are about twice slower.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the tests were run 20 times each.\r\nAnd it was on my t520 (so a different laptop than the one used for the first results).\r\n\r\nAlso the client time is kind of biased. While all the queries are executed in one batch, the database can start sending back results that the OS may process."
