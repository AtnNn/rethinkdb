      "> I think adding implicit default is wrong and should not have been done for filter.\r\n\r\nThe alternative was a lot worse. Almost everyone *hated* the old `filter`. For anyone reading, the history behind this is that we spent months on trying to find good existence semantics, and eventually decided that doing something practical that roughly does the right thing most of the time is the least of all possible evils.\r\n\r\nMoving from 1.11 to subsequent for now since there is no immediate consensus on this. I think we should focus on production readiness for the next few months. Debating non-existence semantics can be *really* distracting. (If someone is opposed to this and wants it in 1.11, let me know)"
