      "Been working on this.  It's actually something of a pain in the ass because we seem to generate sindex keyranges on the machine hosting the query, where we don't have any information on the sindex's ReQL version.  I think we have to change what we send over the wire for this to actually work.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, how attached are we to letting people use their old sindexes when they upgrade to 1.16?  Would it be possible to just force them to update the sindexes before they can use them?  (@danielmewes)"
