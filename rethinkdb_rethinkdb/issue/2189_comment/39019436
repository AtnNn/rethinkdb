      "@danielmewes -- the only timeout I can find in the python driver is when we open a connection (set to 20 seconds).\r\nOnce a connection is open, the driver won't try to close it.\r\n\r\nThe error is an `Errno 110` which lets me think that the host closed the connection.\r\nMaybe it took more than 2 hours to retrieve a batch?"
