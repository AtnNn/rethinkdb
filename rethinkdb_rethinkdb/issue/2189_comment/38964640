      "@nergdron, a few questions about the setup:\r\n\r\nAre you exporting from from the same machine or across a network?  If it is over the network, what is the latency/bandwidth between the nodes?  If it is local, are you writing to the same disk that the database is hosted on?  Based on your comments in #1885, I'm assuming you are using rotational drives.\r\n\r\n1 MB / sec export is shockingly low, but if it was running for two days, a connection timeout isn't entirely out of the ordinary as long as the database and export processes are on separate machines.  Is your database under much load before running the export, and if so, how much read/write?"
