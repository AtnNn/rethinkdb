      "I was talking about this with @mlucy, and he suggested just allowing import/export to reconnect and continue on a connection error like that (and maybe some other cases).  Hopefully that will be enough to solve this problem, but it could be the connection error is hiding some other underlying problem.  I'll look into making this change and getting a patch out this week."
