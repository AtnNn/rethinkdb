      "Read rates under 1 MB/s are to be expected on rotational drives, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThe timeout on the other hand is rather surprising. Does anyone know what the default timeout is for Python?\r\n\r\nIn any case it probably makes sense to set the timeout in the export script to a very high value.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with how the timeout can be changed in Python. @Tryneus: could you describe how to patch the export script to use a higher timeout? That way @nergdron could export his data until we have found and released a proper fix."
