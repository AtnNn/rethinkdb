      "Ok, the changes are up in code review 1393.  I changed import and export to retry any `r.*` calls when `socket.error` exceptions are caught, up to five times in a row without making progress.  If, for example, every third connection manages to get a read or write done, it will still complete (albeit much slower due to connection setup overhead).  If five calls in a row have connection errors and no reads/writes make it though, we exit with an informative error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[==========================              ]  65% \r\n9420 rows imported in 1 table\r\nConnection error during 'import': [Errno 110] Connection timed out\r\nErrors occurred during import\r\n```"
