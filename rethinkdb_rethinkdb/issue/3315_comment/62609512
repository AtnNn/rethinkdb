      "This feels related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3130 .\r\nBasically we have a couple of meta operations that modify tables, which right now can only be called on the database object (or globally, if you want to use the default db) and not on the table object.\r\n\r\n@larkost would you be opposed to closing this issue and adding the part about `table_config` to #3130?"
