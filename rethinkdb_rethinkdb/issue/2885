        "Proposed API: Introduce two new pseudo-tables `rethinkdb.table_stats` and `rethinkdb.server_stats`. The first has one document per table, and the second has one document per server. Each has a bunch of fields with statistics about the table or server. We could also have nested sub-documents to organize the stats.\r\n\r\nOne possible problem is that `stats` looks a lot like `status`."
