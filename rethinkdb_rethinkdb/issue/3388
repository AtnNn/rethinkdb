        "It seems that something about the cache balancer is broken in `next` when the server is started with existing tables.\n- Start a server with a fresh data directory\n- Create a table\n- Insert into the table. In my case I got ~2K inserts/s\n- Delete and then recreate the table\n- Insert into the new table. Still ~2K inserts/s\n- Delete and then recreate the table\n- Restart the server\n- Insert into the table. My insert throughput dropped to ~18 inserts/s (HDD)\n\nRecreating the table after the restart doesn't help either. However if I delete all tables, then restart the server, and then create the table again, inserts are back to 2K/s.\n\nWhen inserts are fast, `iostat` shows exclusively writes (until GC kicks in). When inserts are slow, it shows about equal amounts of reads and writes, hinting towards a cache size of (close to) 0 for the table.\n\n(@larkost This could maybe cause test timeouts, just so you're aware of it.)\n"
