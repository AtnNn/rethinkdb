        "I tried inserting an object of 64 MB (to be on the safe side, use 128 MB when reproducing).\r\n\r\nThe server responded with a client error: \"Client is buggy (failed to deserialize protobuf).\"\r\n\r\nThe server printed the following message on the console:\r\n```\r\nlibprotobuf ERROR google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.cc:156] A protocol message was rejected because it was too big (more than 67108864 bytes).  To increase the limit (or to disable these warnings), see CodedInputStream::SetTotalBytesLimit() in google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.h.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error handling is bad in a number of ways:\r\n1. There shouldn't be such an error in the first place. Inserting large objects or a huge batch of smaller objects should be fine. Maybe at 1 GB or 512 MB one could cap the message size to avoid excessive memory usage on the server, but probably not at 64 MB.\r\n2. The error message only appears on the console, not in the logs of the administration panel\r\n3. The client should receive a better error message, describing that the message was too large."
