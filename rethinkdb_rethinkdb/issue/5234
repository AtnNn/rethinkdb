        "`test-runner` uses the `threading` module to manage multiple simultaneous tests. This method has been showing some problems recently with GIL starvation (some threads monopolize all the CPU cycles), so we wind up running less simultaneous processes than are asked for (e.g.: only 3 when 7 are called for). A better approach would be to drive all of the testing out of a single thread (the main one), and just cycle between the threads. That is what is happening behind the scenes anyways, so there would be no loss, and in fact it would probably be marginally faster from the lack of coordination (even excluding the gain in parallelism)."
