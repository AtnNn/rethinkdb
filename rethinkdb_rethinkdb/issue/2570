        "Hi right now we are trying to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar conn = r.connect({ db: 'marvel' });\r\nr.table('marvel').run(con, fn);\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem is that to use `.run`, `con` has to be ready, which makes sense of course.\r\n\r\nI thought that while you use promises everywhere, you could just handle this use case\r\nby using `con.then` in the `.run` so that once the promise is resolved you can just use it.\r\n\r\nThis use case is important otherwise you need to do a complex wrapper when your application is starting and the rethinkdb connection is not yet ready.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? @neumino "
