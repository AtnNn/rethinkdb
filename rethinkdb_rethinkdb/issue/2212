It has 130 million documents of roughly 4 KB each.\n\nDoing a point get of a document that is in the cache takes 0.5 ms - 0.9 ms according to the query profile. Whether it is close to 0.5 or close to 0.9 ms depends on which machine I run the query on.\n\nPoint gets should be faster than that.\nNot sure if it's a latency or also an efficiency problem.\n"
