      Just
        "@gchpaco needs to use the ICU library for some work he is doing, but v8 also is using this library and to avoid nasty possible mis-matches we are going to need to match the versions exactly. The easiest route to this is probably to make v8 an always-static resource, so that we always have the source code (headers) of the version of v8 we are using. Otherwise we are going to have to do a lot of complicated detection to figure out what the system version of v8 is linked against, which might not have headers available on the system.\n\nPinging @AtnNn for comment on this.\n"
