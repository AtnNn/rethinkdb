What happens if a user of ReQL sends a string with a Unicode character outside of the basic multilingual plane? Does it get encoded as a surrogate pair by the client JSON libraries? Do we then decode it correctly?\r\n\r\nSam Hughes at 11:09:20 AM:\r\n\r\nPresumably we checked that when doing json serialization of datums. Is that true?"
