      "For those watching this issue, it will almost certainly happen before RethinkDB 2.0, but not before 1.9 and possibly 1.10/1.9.1 is out. There is a bit of accumulated technical debt we have to pay back, and we're trying to push even small enhancements back until that done.\r\n\r\nSorry if this causes you pain, if it's really important to you, please let us know and we'll see if we can reprioritize."
