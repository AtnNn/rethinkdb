        "This is fixed in the fix for branch #1328, but we should also make a different patch for 1.9.x.\n\nbatched_rget_stream_t has a pointer to its interruptor, which can get reset with reset_interruptor.  Nobody calls reset_interruptor.  As a result, it has an out-of-date interruptor for itself to use, producing undefined behavior, which in the best case results in an uninterruptible batched get query.\n\nThe code is misdesigned -- that's fixed in the fix for #1328.  As a patch, we should actually call reset_interruptor and add the function to datum_stream_t, too.\n"
