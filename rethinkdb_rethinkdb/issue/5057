        "When trying to access a table that is not ready, we get the error message: `Cannot perform read: Primary replica for shard [\"\", +inf) not available (server d121a0d6-9d63-4f8c-93da-cb8207e6b47c is not ready)`.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of a departure from other table-related error messages, which will mention the table by name.  With this error message, there are three options I see for a user:\r\n\r\n* The query uses one table\r\n  * We need to parse the original query to find the table term\r\n  * Then we can extract the table name and wait for it to be ready\r\n* The query had multiple tables (and a more general user-space solution)\r\n  * We need to correlate the backtrace to the original query to determine which term errored\r\n  * Then we can extract the table name and wait for it to be ready\r\n* Screw trying to parse stuff; just sleep and retry later\r\n\r\nAll of these options are pretty bad, and I believe it would be more consistent with other error messages to just mention the `db.table` that caused the error."
