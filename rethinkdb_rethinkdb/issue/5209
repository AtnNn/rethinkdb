Benefits are many and include monitoring the progress of an upload by pushing out smaller chunks and and appending them to a preexistent document.\r\n\r\nI'd imagine this could work:\r\n```js\r\nr.db('test').table('test').get(\"1\").update({ contents: r.row('contents').append(r.binary(...))})\r\n```\r\n\r\n// ref @mglukhovsky asked to create this issue during a conversation on Slack //"
