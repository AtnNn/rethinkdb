        "Hey guys,\r\nI'm putting a patch together to configure the cluster node reconnect timeout, and I've noticed two issues with `next`:\r\n\r\n  * there are a number of files that seem to have issues with line endings, or at least that's my best guess. I have `core.autocrlf` enabled globally on my systems, and I'm running into this on linux and mac. Nothing I do can \"reset\" these files, they are just automatically modified. Here are the files:\r\n```\r\n\tmodified:   admin/static/fonts/copse_OFL.txt\r\n\tmodified:   admin/static/fonts/open-sans_LICENSE.txt\r\n\tmodified:   admin/static/js/date-en-US.js\r\n\tmodified:   test/performance/comparisons/jquery.tablesorter.js\r\n\tmodified:   test/rql_test/connections/http_support/jinja2/LICENSE.txt\r\n\tmodified:   test/rql_test/connections/http_support/werkzeug/LICENSE.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * the build seems broken on gcc 4.8.4 on ubuntu 14.10:\r\n```\r\nsrc/clustering/administration/auth/scram_authenticator.cc: In member function \8216virtual std::string auth::scram_authenticator_t::next_message(const string&)\8217:\r\nsrc/clustering/administration/auth/scram_authenticator.cc:168:1: error: control reaches end of non-void function [-Werror=return-type]\r\n }\r\n ^\r\ncc1plus: all warnings being treated as errors\r\n```\r\n\r\n  the fix is trivial, adding a `return std::string()` to the end of that method, but should that have been caught by CI? maybe I've configured something incorrectly on my end.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"
