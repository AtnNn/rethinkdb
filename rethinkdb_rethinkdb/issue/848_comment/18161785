      "Ah, I see. Passing `null` as an argument doesn't use it literally as a bound. It's basically a special value which indicates no bound. In this case we're using `null` in a way similar to the C/C++ meaning of `null` than the json meaning of `null` which I think works fine because tables can't have `null` primary keys in them.\r\n\r\nSo to clarify:\r\n`between(1, null)` -> 1 <= value <= MAX_VALUE\r\n`between(null, 1)` -> MIN_VALUE <= value <= 1"
