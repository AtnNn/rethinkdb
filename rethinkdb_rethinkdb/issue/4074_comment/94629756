      "@stuartpb Oh I see what you meant now.\r\n\r\nI guess we were mixing together two different questions here, and I became a bit confused. (a) the question of whether you need an external wrapper like `stunnel` on the server or have RethinkDB server SSL directly and (b) the question of whether SSL client certificates would provide additional benefits over the auth key.\r\n\r\nSo if we a) rely on stunnel, then for b) it makes sense to support a client certificate because that allows stunnel (or another similar server) to keep malicious attackers away from RethinkDB.\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand we a) build SSL into RethinkDB directly, then b) client certificates don't provide  benefit over the existing auth key anymore as you pointed out.\r\n\r\nWhat I was missing was that the two questions were connected. I implicitly assumed we would have SSL in a separate process, and I think your argument applies to the case where it's built into the RethinkDB server. It makes absolute sense then."
