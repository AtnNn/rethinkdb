      "@joaojeronimo Using the auth key will work in many cases, but we haven't written the connection logic with public access in mind. Hence there might be some vulnerabilities for DoS attacks or other issues there. With SSL client authentication, we could rely on the SSL proxy to take care of these issues for us until we have gotten around to thoroughly test and audit the relevant code paths.\r\nI think SSL + auth key will be good though as long as there's an additional firewall."
