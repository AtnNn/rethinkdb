      "@danielmewes Why deal with authentication over SSL ? Why not just do it with the `authKey` ? IMHO SSL should be there just for encryption. Do you meant certificate chain validation on the client ?\r\n\r\nSidenote: If in the future you guys come up with user accounts and an ACL, since the protocol accepts an arbitrary string for the authKey, you could send something like the Authorization http header (Authorization method + ' ' + base64encode(username + ':' + password))"
