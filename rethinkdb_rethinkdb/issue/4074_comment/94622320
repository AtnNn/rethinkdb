      "@danielmewes -- You can have a server than communicate to your Haproxy/nginx server (that communicates with RethinkDB) and your driver can communicate with this new server. I believe @joaojeronimo was doing this before.\r\n\r\nDrawback;\r\n- It's one more thing in the network stack, so more weird behaviors\r\n- It's more complicated to setup.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- The driver doesn't know about SSL\r\n- It feels cleaner to me, though that's kind of subjective"
