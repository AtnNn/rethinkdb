      "Since most of the conversation has pertained to integrating SSL into the client driver, I'd rather we renamed it to reflect that, or continued the discussion for client-driver-integrated SSL in a new issue (that would be higher-level than #4075 or any pull request for the JS/Python driver).\r\n\r\nAlso, is there an open issue regarding the server's SSL/TLS integration?"
