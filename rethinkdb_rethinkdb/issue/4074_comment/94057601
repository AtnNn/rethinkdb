      "Hi @stuartpb, thanks for the suggestion.\r\n\r\nI think we will use SSL for this instead of SSH. We still have to figure out how to do proper client-authentication with SSL, but I think it's the better choice for this. At least in my experience SSH has a pretty slow connection setup, which would be a problem for client connections.\r\n\r\nActually @jipperinbham from Compose has just submitted a pull request to allow the Ruby driver to connect over SSL (not SSH) https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/4075 . I hear he's working on support for other drivers as well.\r\n\r\nWith SSL coming to our drivers, another option you could consider for the Docker image is https://www.stunnel.org/index.html ."
