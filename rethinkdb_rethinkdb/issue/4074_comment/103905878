      "@rclai: that's correct, since the tunnel presents a port via localhost (or in this case, 127.0.0.x). If you reach out to the Compose folks, they can probably guide you better than I can.\r\n\r\nIf a server fails, you'd have to pick a new server regardless in the current JavaScript driver, as we don't yet have connection pooling (see #281). If you need that, you might want to take a look at the alternative [rethinkdbdash](https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash) driver for JavaScript that includes connection pooling and a few other nifty features."
