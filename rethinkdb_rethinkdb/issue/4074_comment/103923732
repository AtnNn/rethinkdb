      "hi @rclai, JP@compose here,\r\n\r\nWe do typically try to point developers to the driver maintainers for questions like this but I'm very sorry if you were put off by support.\r\n\r\nre: SSL support, once the changes [here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/4080) are released in the next driver version (2.2 I believe), we (compose.io) will be offering an additional way to connect to your RethinkDB database that should make things easier from a connection failover standpoint.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do also recommend drivers implement some form of connection pooling/failover as it's a pretty common feature for most drivers. If I can some time soon, I will likely work to add connection pooling to the drivers maintained by RethinkDB."
