        "According to IRC user woogley, `pluck(x, y, z)` will error on rows lacking one of such keys x, y, or z.  However, `without(x, y, z)` will not error if a row lacks such a key.  In general it can be useful to trim down JSON documents to save on network traffic if you're only going to look at a subset of fields, even if some are lacking.  Is erroring on rows that lack such fields the behavior we want?"
