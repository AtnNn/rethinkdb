      "The reason the snapshot nodes are not released is because this command uses a depth first traversal, and that cannot release the root before it is done completely. The existence of the lock on the root makes it difficult to release any snapshots node, because any block could in theory be accessed for a second time during the transaction.\r\n\r\nOne thing we could do is to give the cache some kind of hint that we are not going to touch a block again in this transaction, so it could release the snapshots."
