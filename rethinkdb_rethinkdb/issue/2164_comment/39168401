      "> they only get released at the very end of the traversal\r\n\r\nHmm, why is that the case? I was under the impression that the `rget` QL code only snapshots the tree one batch at a time, which suggests that we should release snapshots incrementally, not all at once at the end of the computation (which should be every 1000 documents or so). We should look into the underlying cache problem, but there might be an issue with how snapshots are used as well. I'd ask @srh and/or @mlucy about this.\r\n\r\n"
