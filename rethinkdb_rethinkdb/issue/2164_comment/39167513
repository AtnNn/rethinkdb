      "In fact it seems to accumulate `alt_snapshot_node_t`s for pretty much everything in the tree, and they only get released at the very end of the traversal.\r\nEach snapshot node also locks the corresponding current_page_t in memory. So that's bad. One essentially cannot do table traversals of huge out-of-memory tables at this point."
