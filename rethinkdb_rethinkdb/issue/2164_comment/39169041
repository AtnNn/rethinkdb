      "@coffeemug I suspect that no batching happens in this specific query `r.table('t1').map(function(x) {return 1;}).count()` since no intermediate data is sent before the very end (when the count results from the different shards are reduced). @mlucy can you confirm this?\r\n\r\nWe could probably force restarting the transactions from time to time in cases like this, that would also avoid the problem."
