      "I don't think any of these should return `CompileError`s because all of them are cases that fail before the server even tries to compile the query.  The only one that I think is borderline is the `Expected X arguments` one in JS, but I think we should solve that by not enforcing arity in the drivers and letting the server produce those errors.\r\n\r\nI do agree that we should probably distinguish these errors from other \"the driver is buggy\" `DriverError`s.  Maybe we should introduce a new error class like `QueryBuildingError` to represent errors that occur while building the query to send to the server?"
