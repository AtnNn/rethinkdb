      "I actually think subclassing `ServerCompileError` and `DriverCompileError` from a common `CompileError` class makes sense. I think that's a pretty good compromise.\r\n\r\nIn practice users will not need to care about this distinction. If some code needs to handle (usually probably log/report and then fail) compilation errors, it can just keep catching `ReqlCompileError`."
