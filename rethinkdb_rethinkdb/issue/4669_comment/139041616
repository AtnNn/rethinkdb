      "Marking as settled with the following modification from the original proposal:\r\n* We'll add two subclasses of `ReqlCompilationError`: `ReqlServerCompilationError` and `ReqlDriverCompilationError`. All `CompilationError`s that are thrown by the server will be mapped to a `ReqlServerCompilationError`. The errors listed in the original post will be changed to instances of `ReqlDriverCompilationError`."
