      "Aside from the intellectual argument that the errors are different, it's really useful to know what component you need to blame for an error.  For example, if you're using a third-party driver and you write code that you think is correct but which produces a driver error, you know that you should open a bug with the driver maintainer rather than in the main RethinkDB repo.  If it produces a compilation error, though, you know that the server is rejecting it, so you know that you should open a bug in the main RethinkDB repo and/or try upgrading your server.\r\n"
