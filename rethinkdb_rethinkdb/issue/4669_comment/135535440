      "Actually, probably the way we should handle this is to have two subclasses of compilation error: `ServerCompilationError` and `DriverCompilationError`.  That will let us distinguish the two but still let people catch and handle both at the same time if they want to.  (Arguably we should have `DriverRuntimeError` too, but I can't think of any errors off the top of my head that fall into that category.)"
