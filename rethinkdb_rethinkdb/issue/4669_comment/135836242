      "Since exceptions are part of the protocol, we should have a really compelling use case for adding new ones.\r\n\r\nThe reason to have an exception class is because you need to programmatically distinguish between types of errors and handle some of them automatically. For determining where you need to file a bug, you just look at the stack trace in your logs, so the error message is enough. No one is going to automatically file a bug report from their app.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to add something like \"(client detected error)\" to the exception messages thrown by the driver, or distinguish them in some way in the message, rather than by adding a new exception to the protocol."
