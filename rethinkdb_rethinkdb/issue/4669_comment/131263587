      ":+1:\r\n\r\nI agree for all of these (i.e. think that they should be `ReqlCompileErrors`), with the following exceptions:\r\n* \"Maximum expression depth exceeded\" / \"Nesting depth limit exceeded\" which are clearly caused by a driver limitation and not by a ReQL limitations or a compilation problem. We should probably consider making these `ReqlResourceLimitError`s instead.\r\n* \"Calling '>=' on result of infix bitwise operator:\" / \"Calling '>=' on result of infix bitwise operator:\" I'm unsure about this one. It's more of a language-specific syntax problem, than a ReQL compilation problem I think.\r\n\r\n"
