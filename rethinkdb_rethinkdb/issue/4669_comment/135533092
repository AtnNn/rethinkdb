      "@mlucy Well the whole premise of this proposal is that users don't care whether something has reached the server or not. Arity errors for example are sometimes caught in the driver, and sometimes on the server. For the user, that doesn't make the slightest difference.\r\nI think it makes sense to move away from distinguishing between *where* errors are handles, and move towards categorizing errors based on *what* the error is."
