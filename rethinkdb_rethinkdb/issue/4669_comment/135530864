      "> \"Maximum expression depth exceeded\" / \"Nesting depth limit exceeded\" which are clearly caused by a driver limitation and not by a ReQL limitations or a compilation problem. We should probably consider making these ReqlResourceLimitErrors instead.\r\n\r\nI disagree with this because a ReqlResourceLimitError inherits from ReqlRuntimeError, which indicates that it was returned by the server.  I do not think that a driver should be raising a ReqlRuntimeError on its own.  As you said, it is a driver/language-specific limitation, so it should probably remain a ReqlDriverError."
