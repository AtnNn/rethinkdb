      "Thanks. As I was that 'someone on SO', that would really help me. We set up and close a lot of connections (up to 100.000 per hour), but sometimes connections get left open if errors are being rescued. I should probably close the connection in the rescue as well to prevent this error. Another solution would be to close a connection after a time-out of 30 seconds or so.. If anyone has any suggestions on the best strategy to use, I'd be very happy to hear them."
