      "> When there's an old{t0} value, it's possible the traversal process might send it again, so we leave a deletion entry behind.\r\n\r\nIf we need to leave a deletion entry behind because `old{t0}` might get sent a second time, wouldn't we already have needed to leave a deletion entry behind because `old{t0}` was sent the first time?  I.e. don't we already need to know whether or not to leave a deletion entry behind before `old{t0}` gets sent?"
