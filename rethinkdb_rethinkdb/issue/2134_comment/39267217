      "One problem here is that we do want to drop deletion entries (that are stored in the b-tree) at some point.  We can't just store deletion entries for all these ancient documents.  Fortunately, some of the benefits from exact timestamps -- such as more efficient secondary index post-construction, wouldn't require us to store all of our deletion entries."
