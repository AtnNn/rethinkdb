      "Deletion entries need to exist for any combined secondary keys (combined secondary/primary key) that the traversal process might later send to the secondary index, and do not need to exist for any other keys.  We assume the secondary index might need to re-traverse parts of the main b-tree multiple times.\r\n\r\nWhen there's an old{t0} value, it's possible the traversal process might send it again, so we leave a deletion entry behind.  When a fresh new{t0} value doesn't have a deletion entry, that's because there's no way the traversal process would send that key/value pair to the secondary index."
