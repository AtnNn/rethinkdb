      "Hmm, I think it's unreasonable to expect backfilling to be too much faster than inserts with soft durability (if we get that going, that'd be awesome, but I think current performance is ok).\r\n\r\n@danielmewes -- firstly, awesome work!! Also, a really important question is what effect backfilling has on live load. Typically if backfilling drops live read/write performance by more than 10-15%, users find it unacceptable (since they can't add a replica without destroying availability of live services). Could you look at that as part of the scope of this issue (or open another one if you think this test is outside of this scope)?"
