      "In case of an incoming backfill and read and write queries running against a separate out-of-memory table, the impact of the backfill is somewhat larger (as expected):\r\nReads go down from 6K to 4K QPS. Write latency increases from 26 ms to 47 ms.\r\n\r\n(why 6K and 26 ms instead of the 5.4K and 33ms mentioned in the previous post for out-of-memory data? It appears that the cache utilization had improved a bit in the meantime)\r\n\r\nThis is very likely due to I/O contention."
