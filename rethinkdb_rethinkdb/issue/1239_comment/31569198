      "It seems like something's going on here.  I think that backfilling used to be significantly faster than inserting (which it should be, since it doesn't have to go through ReQL code, convert things to/from datums and JSON, or anything else).\r\n\r\nIt might not be worth doing now, but I think we should leave this issue open; there are probably performance improvements to be made in the backfilling code that we should get to at some point.\r\n\r\n(Also, should point (2) say \"rotational\" instead of \"SSD\"?)"
