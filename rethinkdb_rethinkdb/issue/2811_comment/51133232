      "The solution is probably to declare `stop_mailbox` after `drainer` in `ql::changefeed::server_t`. This way the `stop_mailbox` destructor will get run first, so it will stop accepting messages while the drainer is draining.\r\n\r\nThere's a good chance that this race condition also exists in `v1.13.x`."
