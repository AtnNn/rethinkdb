      "@bgnorlov You can't mix multiple indexes on the same table. There are two options to accomplish filtering by two values at once:\r\n1. Using an index for one criteria, and then use `filter` for the second one. `filter` is less efficient as it has to look at each document, but is more flexible. http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/filter/\r\n2. Creating a compound index and using that with `between` or `getAll`. In your example case where you're actually only looking for a particular value, `getAll` would be easier to use than `between`: http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/get_all/\r\nSee www.rethinkdb.com/docs/secondary-indexes/javascript/#compound-indexes for more information on compound indexes."
