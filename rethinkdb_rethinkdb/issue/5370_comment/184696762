      "@danielmewes Could you help with my case:\r\nSimplify, I have a Post with multiple Tags (limits at 3) and Scores. And user can query multiple tags at a time. If I use multi index, then I can use `get_all` to query, let say 10 posts with a list of user tags. Then how can I query those with highest Scores. If I use 3 separate compound index like this:\r\n```\r\nFirstTagIndex: [FirstTag, Points],\r\nSecondTagIndex: [SecondTag, Points].\r\nThirdTagIndex: [ThirdTag, Points]\r\n```\r\n then use `between` and `orderBy` and I can get top Scores post but I have to take `number of user selected tags` * `3 tags per post` queries each times, if somehow I can use `between` like `getAll` with multi index then I only have to query 3 time."
