      "@trungtin I don't think there's any efficient way to fetch multiple tags with an index and at the same time do the ordering for the results with the highest score with an index.\r\nIf the result set is not too large, you could simply do an un-indexed `orderBy` after the `getAll`.\r\n\r\nIn the next release of RethinkDB (2.3.0), you could use the new ordered `union` to merge the ordered results for each tag: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5090\r\nBut this isn't supported in RethinkDB 2.2 yet."
