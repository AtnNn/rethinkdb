        "We've talked before about having a macroing system in ReQL. I think now would be a really good time to do it because it makes many of the ReQL improvements we're hoping to make over the next few releases a lot easier. Issues like #838, #182 and #324 would be very simple to implement. All it would require is writing a bit of ReQL code to define a new macro. This is particularly nice because even in places where we eventually need some backend support for something to do it efficiently in a lot of places we can still create a minimal useful implementation using macros to play with the API.\r\n\r\nI think this project will be a lot simpler if we don't expose it to users at first. Basically just have a system for doing what we already do internally for things like `join` that lets use iterate quickly on these things."
