        "The web UI seems to use different methods to figure out table/replica availability in different places. This sometimes leads to inconsistent data (see the attached image).\r\n\r\nAlso I often noticed that on the overview for a specific table, right under Statistics, it would say \"Live\" next to a green icon, even if some of the shards are actually down. In this example, the table was in fact not available, neither for outdated nor up-to-date reads.\r\n\r\n![inconsistent web ui](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/505365/1720792/b4a076bc-620d-11e3-900c-e91b795a9b96.png)\r\n\r\n@neumino: Ideas? :-)\r\n"
