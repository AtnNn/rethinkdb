        "The benefit of having an explicit trigram index vs. convenience functions to create generic multi-indexes is that you can build things like regex search on top if you know the underlying index has trigram invariants:\n\nhttps://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html\n\nThe linked article is about RE2 style regexes (i.e. no backtracking etc), and it would allow us to do things like `table('files').match('bleh.*\\.jpg', index='filename_trigram')`\n\nThis is related to #2601 because full text search might be built off trigram indexes as well, though this is more narrowly scoped.\n"
