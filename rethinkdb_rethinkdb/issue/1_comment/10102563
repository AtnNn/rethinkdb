      "I \"outlined\" it intentionally to make the code more verbose and easier to read, but that's up to taste.\r\nI just found that there's a boost function to check the prefix of a string, boost::starts_with(content_type.get(), expected_content_type). This would allow for a compact inlining in the predicate again."
