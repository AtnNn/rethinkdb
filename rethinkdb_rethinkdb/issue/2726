        "Currently changefeeds on a range will never merge, and changefeeds on a point or aggregation will always merge (the latter is unimplemented but in the spec we settled).\r\n\r\n@coffeemug proposes we add an optarg `merge` which can change that behavior, and that we make merging the default behavior for range feeds as well.  The valid options to `merge` would be `true`, `false`, or a number of seconds (specified as a double).  If it's a number of seconds, we will hold back data for that many seconds to merge as much as we can.  (In practice this will probably be set to `.1` or something.)"
