      "I don't remember exactly, but looking at the conditions in admin/static/coffee/issues.coffee `render_table_availability` I think I have an explanation:\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\n        h \"p\", [\r\n            \"The following servers are disconnected:\"\r\n            h \"ul\", info.missing_servers.map((servername) ->\r\n                h \"li\",\r\n                    h \"code\", servername\r\n            )\r\n        ] if info.missing_servers.length > 0\r\n        h \"p\", [\r\n            \"None of the replicas for this table are reachable \"\r\n            \"(the servers for these replicas may be down or disconnected). \"\r\n            h \"br\"\r\n            \"No operations can be performed on this table until at least \"\r\n            \"one replica is reachable.\"\r\n        ] if info.missing_servers.length == 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it shows the observed message if no servers are reported missing.\r\nHowever a table can be not fully ready for reasons other than a missing server, so I believe this check is wrong.\r\n\r\nI was probably reconfiguring a larger table, so it took a while for it to bring all replicas up to date."
