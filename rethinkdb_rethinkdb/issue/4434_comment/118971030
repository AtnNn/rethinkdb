      "According to @timmaxw (via slack)\r\n> there will never be a table availability issue if all servers are connected. We show an issue if table has reduced availability AND at least one server is disconnected \r\n\r\nSo I think the logic is correct, and if we see an issue like this and the servers are not disconnected, then it's a bug in the issue code. I think we should verify what conditions this can occur in, and then close this (possibly opening a server issue if we find something buggy in the issue code)\r\n"
