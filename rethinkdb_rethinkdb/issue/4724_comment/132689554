      "We have had a number of discussions on this: #3009, #3011, and #3287 are a good overview.\r\n\r\nThe short of it is that geo calculations use floating point math, and sadly there can be generally non-meaningful differences in those calculations depending on the hardware and software that they are run on. Those slight differences force us to mark anything using floating point as non-deterministic to force all of the calculations to happen on one machine.\r\n\r\nThere are ways around this, but we have not yet figured one that does not have performance and complexity challenges that we are willing to take yet."
