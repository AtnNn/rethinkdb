      "Injecting a log message turned out to be rather tricky due to their timestamps being the primary key of the `rethinkdb.logs` table, thus having to be unique, as well as being used as the basis for changefeeds on the table. Instead we will log an actual error, at most once, which should show up next time it's queried.\r\n\r\nIn CR 3269 by @danielmewes."
