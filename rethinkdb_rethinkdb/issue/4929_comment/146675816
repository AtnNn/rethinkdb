      "> I think we should instead return a `log_message_t` with `log_level_error`, the current time as the timestamp, and an error message saying something like \"unparseable log message `%s`\" with the literal message in the string.\r\n\r\n:+1: that sounds like a really good idea.\r\n\r\nWe don't have the log file, but maybe William could provide it."
