      "I think skipping unparseable log messages is a bad idea.  In this particular case where there was a bunch of unexpected whitespace that's what you want, but if it's an important log message that we couldn't parse for some reason you still want to inform people that it exists.\r\n\r\nI think we should instead return a `log_message_t` with `log_level_error`, the current time as the timestamp, and an error message saying something like \"unparseable log message `%s`\" with the literal message in the string.\r\n\r\nWe should also try to figure out how we wrote a line of all whitespace to the log file.  Do we have the log file in question?"
