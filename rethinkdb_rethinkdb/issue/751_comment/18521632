      "This is definitely getting in soon (possibly even 1.6) for the client drivers, as it's a requirement for some other cool stuff we're working on. I'm moving to 1.6 for now, but I might have to shuffle it back out (depending on how the dev process goes) into 1.7. In any case, this is happening soon.\r\n\r\n(It might take a bit longer to get this done for HTTP itself, but at the very least we'll write up some instructions on how to do it with a proxy)."
