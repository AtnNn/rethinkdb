      "@tlperkins -- Websockets are not available, the http server that communicates with the web interface is written in C++.\r\n\r\nWhile it would be nice to have such feature, it would require quite some work\r\n- the server should be able to handle a new type of connection\r\n- the driver should have a new type of connection\r\n- how to present the changes is actually hard to do well. The best I can think of is to buffer new changes (and drop some if there are too many), and to require the user to click on a link to display new changes.\r\n\r\nYou probably don't want to display changes as soon as you get them (or automatically hide changes) since it would update the interface and make selecting text quite annoying.\r\nYou also don't want to keep too many changes in your buffer, or the browser will crash because it uses too much memory\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'll not display feeds for now. And if somehow I have time before we release 1.13, I'll see if I can display them in a nice way."
