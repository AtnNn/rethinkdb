      "@tlperkins -- `r.http` works seamlessly in the data explorer, but change feeds are a bit harder to handle. We originally envisioned them purely as an integration tool (with software like RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, etc.) but then discovered that people want to use them in many more cases (i.e. live client sync).\r\n\r\nI agree this should be in the data explorer, but unfortunately won't make it into 1.13 -- I've opened #2466 to track better changefeed/web UI integration."
