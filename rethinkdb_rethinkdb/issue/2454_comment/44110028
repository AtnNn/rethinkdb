      "What is the backend of the WebUI implemented in? Is SocketIO or Websockets and option.  If that's the case the solution could be wired together without too much pain.  I think with r.http and some of the other awesome things people are waiting for in 1.13, the expectation is that the data explorer is a feature complete environment for full experimentation."
