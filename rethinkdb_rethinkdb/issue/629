        "We need to clean up some of the button styles and add behavior to the Tables View:\r\n  - Add two-step confirmation to the _Delete database_ button. The confirmation should require typing the name of the database before allowing deletion (to prevent accidental one-click deletes). This has been done well in several systems: Github's _Delete repository_ modal is the first that comes to mind.\r\n  - Add icons to buttons. We should use the same set that we used for the Data Explorer's new buttons. This will make individual buttons far more distinct.\r\n  - Fix the awful \"selected\" style in the _Operations_ dropdown button on the Table View. It should have an inset style when selected (and when the dropdown is showing). We should consider adding icons to the dropdown items as well."
