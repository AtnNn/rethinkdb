        "We should use libnuma [1] on Linux to allocate pages on the NUMA node of the cache that is going to use them. That will improve both performance and avoid problems like running out of usable RAM too early (see [2]).\n\nNote that we are already allocating buffers on the right thread in 1.12. However #2130 makes it difficult to maintain this property.\n\nA work-around for allocation problems is to launch rethinkdb with `numactl --interleave all`. However that won't help with the (potential) performance regression, and is annoying.\n\n[1] http://linux.die.net/man/3/numa\n[2] http://blog.jcole.us/2010/09/28/mysql-swap-insanity-and-the-numa-architecture/\n"
