      "Thanks very much @danielmewes . Also, thanks for the heads up on the `AstSubclass` template change. I'll try to get this ported later this weekend or early next week.\r\n\r\nAlso, just out of curiosity, where did [`.wait_()`, `.reconfigure()`, and `.rebalance()`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/commit/762875067d0fd951c6c4ff97f1ed32365d9e7a0c#diff-207dbbc154b3706536deef373a82ce18L808) go? Were they dupes in `TopLevel`?"
