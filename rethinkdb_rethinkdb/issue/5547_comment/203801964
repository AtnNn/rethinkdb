      "@danielmewes Thanks very much for the info and diffs. It was very helpful porting downstream. The regenerated C# driver AST now has the new `fold` term and support for `union:interleave`. https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver/commit/94caa94a008651532b59560229c859041e5e608b\r\n\r\nI'm probably going to hold off on re-generating unit tests until 2.3.0 is released since it looks like we have a new `fold.yaml` test group."
