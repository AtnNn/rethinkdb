      "Why would you want to remove the primary key?\r\n\r\nI didn't properly describe my use case earlier, but I plan to automatically create indexes when people join models in thinky. I need to know if I indeed need to create an index and/or wait for it to be complete.\r\n\r\nAlso if \"id\" is the primary key, I cannot create an index named \"id\", so it would make sense to add it in `indexList`.\r\n\r\nOr maybe I'm missing a use case?"
