      "Thanks for reporting this. FYI, the ```did you forget a `return`?``` comes from the attempt to make the error message for the following code work better:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table('foo').filter(function(row) {\r\n  row('bar').lt(20);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the user forgot the return in the body of the function, which often resulted in a very confusing error message. Of course fixing that made the error message confusing in other cases.\r\n\r\nWe should definitely change the driver to make the error clear for cases where ```did you forget a `return`?``` doesn't make sense (basically that part shouldn't show up unless the driver is dealing with a return value of a function).\r\n\r\nAssigning @wmrowan. Bill, could you comment on how quickly we can get this in?"
