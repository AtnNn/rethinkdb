Indeed, isn't that the whole point of exception backtraces?\r\n\r\nI've got a fairly simple solution in place in branch 914_undefined_error. @neumino why don't you play with it and let me know if this solution doesn't work for you. If you want something a little different you can encode it in a polyglot test and I'll try to match your desired output."
