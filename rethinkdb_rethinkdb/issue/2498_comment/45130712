      "Another data point for this: a test that I am writing shards a newly created table after filling in a few (60-250, depends on time) records. The odd thing about this is that it is taking 2.02 seconds from the shard command until the table again responds to queries. This seems a little long to me, but the surprising point to me was that both my local computer (Mac mini, spinning disk) and Newton (beefy, ssd) gave me the exact same number.\r\n\r\nI tried varying the number or records (going to 600 on newton), but that did not change the time. To me this feels like there is a 2 second timeout firing somewhere."
