      "That's what I meant by \"PostgreSQL splits tables that are larger than 1 GB into multiple files\"\8206. Sorry if that was unclear.I'll look into the 2s delay. That is interesting. We do have some hard-coded delays in the clustering code to make these operations more efficient on large clusters (because multiple changes are combined before being sent over the network). I wouldn't expect this to take a full 2s though."
