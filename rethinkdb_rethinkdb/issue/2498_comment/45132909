      "But combining with my comment about they way MySQLis typically used, it means that of the 4 peer databases sited two of them typically have a 1 : 1+ mapping between tables and files. That tends (from a perp pressure standpoint) to argue against having multiple small tables in a single file.\r\n\r\nPersonally as a sysadmin I would prefer having multiple tables not being combined in a single file for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. If there is filesystem corruption on one file I probably only have to concentrate on recovering one table (not counting foreign keys).\r\n2. It opens the door to the possibility of being able to recover a single corrupted table from backup. In practice things get much messier than this, but at the MySQL conference a year ago the Oracle/MySQL team was getting heat from people encouraging them to make sure that replication could deal with that sort of recovery (it is a bit of a mess right now when doing that).\r\n3. It allows (in theory) having some tables on fast disk while others on slow."
