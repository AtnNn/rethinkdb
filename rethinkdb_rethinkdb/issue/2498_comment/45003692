      "> I don't think we should do this. There are devopsy reasons to keep each table in its own file. It's generally expected by users and most other systems do it this way\r\n\r\nI can see the devops reasons for it, but I don't think it would be a bad idea to offer it as an option for scenarios with lots of small tables.\r\n\r\nMost other systems don't have a 1:1 mapping between tables and files either:\r\n- PostgreSQL splits tables that are larger than 1 GB into multiple files [1]\r\n- Oracle stores all tables into one or multiple files (configurable) [2]\r\n- MySQL/InnoDB stores all tables either into shared files or creates one file per table (configurable) [3]\r\n- DB2 can be configured to allocate a huge file and manage space within [4]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_for_Oracle_DBAs#Tablespaces_and_Object_Data_Files\r\n[2] http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/Tablespace#Permanent_tablespaces\r\n[3] http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-multiple-tablespaces.html\r\n[4] http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/0212wieser/index.html#tablespacemanagement"
