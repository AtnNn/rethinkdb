We use a number of JS libraries and features of Bootstrap to provide the skeleton for the web UI.\r\n\r\nWe should decide on one of the following:\r\n\r\n- Upgrade to v3\r\n- Decide that we're going to continue patching problems with browser bugs, etc. as they come up\r\n- Analyze how we use Bootstrap and remove as many components as we can to move away from it.\r\n\r\nMoving to backlog-- this issue is to prompt a discussion with @neumino and @coffeemug."
