        "I was doing some heavy-duty last minute testing, and I'm delighted to report that secondary indexes work under all sorts of odd conditions with masters failing and `use_outdated` turned on. Nice! (EDIT: not that I ever doubted ya'll)\n\nHowever, runing `r.table('foo', use_outdated=True).index_list()` returns a \"no master available\" error (the master was indeed down). Is this expected behavior, or should one be able to list indexes when the master is down and `use_outdated` is turned on?\n\nPing @mlucy @jdoliner\n"
