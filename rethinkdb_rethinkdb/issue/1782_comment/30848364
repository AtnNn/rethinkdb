      "the general concept of using mongoose with other mongodb drivers was a design goal. it falls a little short but much of the design is there already, albeit [undocumented](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose/tree/3.8.x/lib/drivers). \r\n\r\nas for making mongoose compatible with a different database altogether, well that would take _a lot_ more work. not against it really, but not in favor either since it opens the door to even more dbs and more complexity which i'm not a fan of. I think one reason mongoose has been successful is its core focus on a single database and optimizing for it alone. this lowers implementation complexity and maximizes the small amount of time we have to work on the project.\r\n"
