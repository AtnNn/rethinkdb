      "I looked at porting mongoose to RethinkDB, and eventually didn't do it.\r\n\r\nI think it didn't look that hard, but the API wasn't as nice as using ReQL. So in the end I wrote thinky (https://github.com/neumino/thinky -- I have to update it though).\r\n\r\nI still think that making mongoose work for RethinkDB would be useful, and I would be happy to help you. \r\nI'll be more or less traveling by plane/boat/horse for the next few days, but I should be able to answer any question you have."
