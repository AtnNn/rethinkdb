      "I'd probably start from scratch being that mongoose needs to start from\r\nscratch anyway due to too much logic contained internally which should\r\nreally exist in separate stand-alone modules. If you went this way I'd love\r\nto be involved and provide feedback since ideally we could reuse some of\r\nthese components between projects and have both projects win. Kind of\r\nbuilding that higher level abstraction I don't want but without\r\nnecessitating including the code specific to Rethink and the Rethink\r\nproject not including the MongoDB parts. Worth a shot I'd say. No idea how\r\nRethink or MongoDB feel about it though :)\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, December 19, 2013, coffeemug wrote:\r\n\r\n> @aheckmann <https://github.com/aheckmann> -- that makes sense (less and\r\n> more and all).
