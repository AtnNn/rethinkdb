        "I was writing up an explanation of how to use secondary indexes to match regexes and I followed my intuition and wrote this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('users').indexCreate('test', r.row('first_name').match('S.*'))\r\nr.table('users').between(null, null, {index: 'test'})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected the between call to return *only* the documents where `first_name` starts with `S`, but instead it returned everything because we include `null` into the secondary index. I had to rewrite the query as follows to actually work:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('users').indexCreate('test', r.row('first_name').match('S.*').ne(null))\r\nr.table('users').getAll(true, {index: 'test'})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think we picked behavior of secondary indexes wrt NULLs and should change it to exclude NULLs. That seems a lot more natural to me."
