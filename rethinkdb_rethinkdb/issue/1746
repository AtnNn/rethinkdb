        "I periodically get \"You have been disconnected from the server\" messages in the web interface on a certain cluster. After a few seconds it reconnects, and remains connected for a while before it happens again. I don't have any load on the server, so I don't think this is actually a server issue.\n\nThe RethinkDB cluster is a 3-node cluster running on CloudSigma in Switzerland, and I'm connecting to the web interface from our office. I think this might be due to the relatively high network latency.\nICMP ping shows round-trip times of between 250 and almost 500 ms. Could that be enough to cause the timeout?\n\nIt seems that our timeout might be too short. Or maybe we serialize requests, such that the high latency on the connection has an overly huge impact?\n\n@neumino: Probably your domain. Any ideas?\n"
