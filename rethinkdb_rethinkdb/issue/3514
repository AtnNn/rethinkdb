        "In working with the `rethinkdb.issues` table I have found myself automatically thinking that I should be finding old (resolved) issues in the table. Intellectually I know that this is a psudo-table, and so is not really a log-like table, but the tendency continues.\r\n\r\nI am taking this as a sign that users will be similarly confused by this, and I think that changing the psudo-table's name to `rethinkdb.current_issues` would avoid this confusion."
