      "I just took a look at that, and I'm almost sure that I just merged the wrong branches (or didn't merge the good one).\r\nI do remember having fixed 2 and 4 at least. Anyway, that's my fault and I'm sorry for that; I'll try to be more careful.\r\n\r\n1. Fixed, there was an old class `tree_view` that was not removed\r\n\r\n2. Fixed, the class `.results` still had a width set to `888px`.\r\nThe text of the button was changing at some point before 1.2 but I don't remember removing it. Anyway, it's back.\r\n\r\n3. I did push a change to merge the textarea and the results, but it wasn't looking bad (you were the one who told me to remove it if I'm not mistaken). I can merge them again if you want to take another look at what it looks like.\r\n\r\n4. What we have now is the desired behavior (at least it's what I was thinking when I designed it). I'm also not sure to get the last part of this one.\r\n\r\n5.  If I understood what you were saying, it's fixed, the padding for `.json_tree` was set to `20px` instead of `0px 20px`\r\n\r\n6. I cannot reproduce that one, are you resizing the second to last column and the last one get resized?\r\n\r\n\r\n@coffeemug could you show me 4, 5, and 6 when you have some time today?\r\n"
