        "There are two scenarios we need to check for:\n- A server is listed as director for a table. The server is permanently removed. The table now has no director; reading `rethinkdb.table_config` will give `null` in the `director` field. It will not accept reads or writes. We should display an issue.\n- All of the replicas for one shard of a table are permanently removed. (This implies the first scenario). In this case we have (probably) permanently lost all of the data for that shard. We should display an issue.\n"
