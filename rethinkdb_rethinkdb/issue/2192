        "This proposal obviously isn't a priority right now, but it would be a great future addition to RethinkDB:\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice to be able to send a script (in this instance, javascript) to a RethinkDB server and have the RQL queries run in the server itself, so if users wanted to run data analysis remotely (for example), they wouldn't have to pull large amounts of data across the network to analyse it, as the script would be running on the server itself.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this?"
