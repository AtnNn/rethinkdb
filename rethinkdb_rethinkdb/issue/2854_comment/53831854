      "Lazy `get_intersecting()` is implemented in branch daniel_2854 (some more testing pending) and in code review 2035.\r\n\r\nI don't think we really need lazy `get_nearest()`. By default that command is limited to 100 results. It also turns out that implementing a lazy variant of it without sacrificing a lot of efficiency is not trivial."
