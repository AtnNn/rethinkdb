      "> At the very least, the API should return a stream while it's temporarily an array internally.\r\n\r\nI'd like to avoid that if we can.  It's very easy for someone playing around in the REPL to open a lot of streams and not close them, which will make RethinkDB run out of memory if it's holding onto a huge array for each stream.\r\n"
