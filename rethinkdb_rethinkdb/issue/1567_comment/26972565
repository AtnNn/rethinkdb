      "I think I was one of those who complained about `order_by` returning an array.\r\n\r\nWe can't parse just a few elements with protobuf, we have to parse the whole message. The JavaScript library has a hard time with 1000 documents (See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1459), and parsing a big array would just kill the client.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it's fair to expect from our users to pay attention to that. People should fetch all the data from a cursor or close it, like they should close a file when they are done reading it."
