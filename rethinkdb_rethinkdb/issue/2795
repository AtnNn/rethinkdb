        "`test/rql_test/test_runner` supports the `-c` and `-d` options to connect to an already running server. That is very useful to run tests against a server running under Valgrind for example.\r\n\r\nHowever this mode of operation seems to be broken.\r\n\r\nI'm getting this error:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"./test-runner\", line 761, in <module>\r\n    main()\r\n  File \"./test-runner\", line 540, in main\r\n    build_directory = options.executable_path\r\nAttributeError: Values instance has no attribute 'executable_path'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `executable_path` option doesn't seem to exist anymore though. If I change the code to specify the path manually the next problem is\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"./test-runner\", line 761, in <module>\r\n    main()\r\n  File \"./test-runner\", line 541, in main\r\n    servers = RethinkDBRunningServer(options.driver_port, options.cluster_port)\r\n  File \"./test-runner\", line 367, in __init__\r\n    self.rethinkdb_executable_ = rethinkdb_executable\r\nNameError: global name 'rethinkdb_executable' is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat line just seems to be unnecessary, since `self.rethinkdb_executable_` isn't used anywhere as far as I can see.\r\n\r\nPing @larkost "
