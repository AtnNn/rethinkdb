      "This is another example of why we should push the daemonization of the process further down. I'm 100% sure there already is an issue for it, but can't find it at the moment. The issue I'm thinking of was about daemonizing *after* the log file is created and not before. We might be able to extend it to include this case as well (though I'm not sure how easy that is)."
