      "I opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5266 to give Java 7 support another consideration. I'll mark this as `notabug` in favor of the new Java 7 issue.\r\n\r\n@vijayakumarn Can you share a bit more about your use case for this?\r\nIt's not common to access a RethinkDB database server directly from an Android app, since that will mean having to expose the RethinkDB server to the public. I can see this being useful for internal applications though, or when being in a VPN."
