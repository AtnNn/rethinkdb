      "Currently, the Java driver is only compatible with Java 8. See this blog post:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.rethinkdb.com/blog/official-java-driver/\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the GitHub issue on the subject:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3930#issuecomment-94911187\r\n\r\nThe primary reason is the official Java 8 requirement is lambda support. There was enthusiasm for additional Java 7 (or lower) support. \r\n\r\nHowever, as Daniel suggests, you could try this Java (unofficial) driver for now:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/rethink-java-driver\r\n"
