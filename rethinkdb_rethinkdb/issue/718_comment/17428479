      "I think there's a high chance that what would happen is:\r\n* We would implement that.\r\n* We would later add a global optional argument for some deterministic query and forget that we need to do more work on this when we do.\r\n* Some user will write a secondary index that depends on that optional argument and either crash the server or get a strange runtime result.\r\n\r\nIt's sort of hard with the current architecture to check programmatically whether any of the terms in the query might reference a global optional argument.  I think it would be safer just to do this correctly.\r\n\r\n(Alternatively, if we're just trying to ship 1.5 I could do the easy thing and leave this issue open to remind myself to do the harder thing later.)"
