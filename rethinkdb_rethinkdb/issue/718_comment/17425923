      "After thinking about this for a second, I'm becoming more hesitant to simply ban variable access.  We would also need to ban access to any global optional arguments in the query, and those are much harder to search the query for programatically.  (Currently the only one in active use is the default database, but we could well add more in the future.)\r\n\r\nJust running the query isn't good enough either because it might try to access something it's missing in a branch.\r\n\r\nI think that if we can we should try to store the global optional arguments and scope present at the time the function is evaluated."
