      "Finally, there is the crash `Guarantee failed: [handler != __null]` which is especially disturbing (`rpc/connectivity/cluster.cc:1118`).  First, all servers should drop connections from peers with a different version string, so we can most likely rule out incompatible versions.  Second, all servers should be running with the same set of handlers (services built on top of the connectivity layer).  The idea that one server provides an unrecognized tag makes me think that either:\r\n\r\n * A service was destroyed out of order on the crashed server.\r\n * The TCP stream is being corrupted.\r\n\r\nWould need to investigate more to determine the plausibility of the first and whether there are other possibilities."
