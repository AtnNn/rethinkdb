      "I asked Digital Ocean about the possibility of bad ram or NIC and they sent the following response:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSince droplets are technically virtual servers the hardware is usually not the problem in many situations. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have redundancy of all components to ensure best performance. \r\nIf something fails our team gets notified of the issue and action is taken immediately. \r\nI can assure you that there are no issues with RAM or the NIC related to your droplet.\r\n\r\nUsually, with bad RAM or NIC the OS in general will have issues booting up or pinging another host.\r\n```"
