      "Ok, after a little research into `cluster_message_handler_t`s, I have come to the conclusion that the `Guarantee failed: [handler != __null]` error is impossible (at least according to the code).\r\n\r\nAll `cluster_message_handler_t`s are constructed on the stack after the `connectivity_cluster_t` but before the `connectivity_cluster_t::run_t`.  This means that there is no race condition: all client connections will have been terminated before the message handlers are destroyed, and so there should never be a tag missing from the `message_handlers` map.  The best explanation at this point is corruption.\r\n\r\nIf it's not too much trouble, @timjrobinson, I'd suggest you check `db-6` for bad RAM or network interfaces (which could possibly have resulted in (some of) the other errors being observed)."
