      "Thanks for the extra info, @timjrobinson.  The second `rethinkdb` process is actually a fork of the first one, which we use for launching worker processes for tasks like `r.js` and `r.http`.\r\n\r\nThe `client_magic_number != -1` error should happen when a client connects.  Out of curiosity, do you have some load-balancing to distribute client connections across the cluster?\r\n\r\nThe `unsupported protocol version` error is also really strange if you get it when a client is connecting, unless some other data is getting on the line (or one of your clients somehow has an incorrect version number, which hasn't changed for a few releases).  I'm vaguely worried that your servers' ports are not configured correctly (maybe the `connect` directive in a config file is incorrect), but I can't come up with a scenario that would plausibly result in these errors.\r\n\r\nAs for my theory that the `client_magic_number != -1` crash was caused by a conflicted auth key, could you confirm that your cluster has or had an auth_key set?"
