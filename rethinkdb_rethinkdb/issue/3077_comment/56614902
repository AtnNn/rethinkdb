      "Not sure about the missing backtraces, but from a quick visual inspection, it looks like the `Guarantee failed: [client_magic_number != -1]` error can happen pretty consistently if the auth key is conflicted (`protob/protob.cc:249`).  This should only be when clients are connecting, and is (probably) unrelated to the other connectivity issues."
