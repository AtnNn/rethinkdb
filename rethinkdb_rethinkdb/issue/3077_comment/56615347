      "As for the heartbeat timeouts, what is especially confusing is that first, these are happening every 2 seconds, which is on every heartbeat between the peers.  In addition, the connection is not actually being dropped.  At the beginning of the first logs posted, the heartbeat timeout can be seen to be operating correctly, and connectivity is lost for 2 minutes and 5 minutes.  This makes me think that the heartbeat code is malfunctioning in some way(s)."
