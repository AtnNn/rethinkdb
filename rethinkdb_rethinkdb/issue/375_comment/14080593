      "I think that @al3xandru is talking about prototypes for tables. This is a useful feature in its own right that isn't actually related to default dicts but they can kind of play nicely together in the sense that default dicts are frequently most useful in prototypes. For example someone might want to say:\r\n\r\n    table_create(\"users\", prototype = {\"tag_counts\" : defaultdict(0)})\r\n\r\nHowever there's nothing actually related about the two.\r\n\r\nActually I guess you could make the argument that prototypes are sort of the equivalent of default values for tables. But I'm not sure that's what we're talking about."
