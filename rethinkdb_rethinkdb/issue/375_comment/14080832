      "I would hold off on doing this until we understand the use cases better. Default dicts smell bad to me (from my SQL-world perspective), and doing it on table creation level seems like applying SQL-y limitations in the NoSQL world (which is bad, of course).\r\n\r\nI think once we implement defaults and `Nothing` and see how people use the language, this will become much, much clearer."
