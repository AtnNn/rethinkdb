      "@danielmewes is there any technical limitation to creating multiple \"expiration hooks\" on a table? If not, I think there are definitely supporting use-cases that would warrant it. For example, consider documents that have `date_start` and `date_end` fields. You want the documents to be `active: true` when the current date is within that range. This would require an expiration function on each date field.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I would think the API should adopt the same semantics as table/index functions (i.e. `expirationCreate`, `expirationDrop`, `expirationList`, etc)."
