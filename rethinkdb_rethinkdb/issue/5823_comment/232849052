      "is there any chance this could some day be used \"other way around\"? Instead of having a ttl for the document, a (insert/update) query would be ran when the \"timer\" would reach the end? So instead of having timers at application level, you could define these operations inside the rethinkdb. I would think this kind of functionality could be very useful on games for example."
