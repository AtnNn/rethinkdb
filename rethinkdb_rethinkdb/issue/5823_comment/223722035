      "@tatsujin1 \r\n> what would it look like \"setting a flag on the document\" as you mentioned?\r\n\r\nYes, exactly what you wrote. In addition, you'll have to make sure that changing the status removes the document from the bottom of the index.\r\nFor example you could use the following index function:\r\n```js\r\ntbl.indexCreate(\"expirationIndex\", function(x) {\r\n    return r.branch(x('status').ne(\"he's dead, jim\"), x('expirationTs'), null );\r\n})\r\n```"
