      "I'm (still) not convinced the nested option object is the best way to put it. However, I don't have a counter-proposal. :(\r\n\r\nAlso, how would the python variant look? Usually arguments like `{index: \"abc\"}` would in the python driver become `index='abc'`. Nice and clean :)\r\nBut as this is nested, it doesn't translate so well into \"pythonese\": \r\n`time={'index': 'indexName', 'delay': 600}`.\r\n\r\nFrom a python programmer's perspective this inline dictionary is kind of sudden as there aren'y any other optional function arguments that are dictionaries (I think?). If there are already, I guess I'll shut up. :)\r\n\r\nedit: formatting"
