      "Well the nested one is just more annoying to specify in some languages, for example Python or Java.\r\n\r\nAt the same time this is going to be a rare operation in scripted code, so it probably doesn't matter all that much.\r\n\r\nI'm still slightly tending towards `trigger: 'time'` because it's just nicer to write in Python.\r\n\r\nGoing to mark this settled tonight with that syntax unless anyone else has last-minute objections."
