      "The nesting in the options is a bit ugly I think. On the other hand it feels a bit more logical.\r\n\r\nOne thing that this format suggests is that a single eviction could in the future have multiple triggers (one time- and one size-based trigger). Supporting that isn't necessary, but also wouldn't hurt I think.\r\n\r\nI don't have a clear preference, but am happy with the nested option format. :+1:"
