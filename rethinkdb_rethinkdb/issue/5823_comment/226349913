      "Some other random comments:\r\n\r\n@mlucy \r\n> (Also, what happens if the index is deleted or renamed or something? Should the expiration function silently disappear, or should we open an issue in the web UI?)\r\n\r\nI think it should be internally bound to an index ID, not an index name. So it would survive index renames.\r\nIf `indexDrop` is called on an index that still has an expiration function using it, I think we should fail and ask the user to delete the expiration function(s) first. Since both indexes and expiration functions would likely be managed as part of the table's Raft state, this check can be performed atomically and safely.\r\n\r\n@v3ss0n \r\n> we can expect 2.4 within 2 months?\r\n\r\nThat's about what we're currently heading for. It might end up being a bit earlier or later though."
