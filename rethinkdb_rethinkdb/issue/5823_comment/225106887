      "I think always creating an index might be a bad idea. I would guess that in most cases people will already have an index on the field they're using to determine whether documents should be expired, and indexes are actually pretty heavyweight in ReQL.  If we had duplicate index elimination that would be pretty cool, but since we don't it would be a pretty unfortunate performance hit to create a whole duplicate index.\r\n\r\nI kinda like Daniel's idea of the expiration function being attached to an index.  We could even roll this into the `indexCreate` API if we wanted too: `indexCreate` could take an optarg `expire` containing the expiration function.  (That might be a dumb idea, though, since I would guess it isn't totally uncommon to want to change the expiration function without creating a new index.)"
