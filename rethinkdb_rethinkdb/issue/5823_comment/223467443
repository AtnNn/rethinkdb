      "Something I didn't point out explicitly above:\r\n\r\nThis can be used to implement both expiration after fixed TTL intervals or expiration based on a per-document TTL through the choice of a suitable secondary index function.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to restrict expiration based on document contents. For example you can expire only documents that have a certain `status` value. This also would be handled by the secondary index function."
