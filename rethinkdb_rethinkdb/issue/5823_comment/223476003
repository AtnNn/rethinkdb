      "> Good point, we can do that. So we would basically do the replace with returnChanges and compare the actual index values after the write?\r\n\r\nWe could do it that way, although we'd have to have a way to evaluate the sindex function.  It might be easier to hook into the sindex modification callback, but I dunno.\r\n\r\n> In either case, the sleep gets interrupted if any write on the primary's shard range introduces an index value that's smaller than nextTS.\r\n\r\nWhoops, missed that part somehow."
