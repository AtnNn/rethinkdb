      "@tatsujin1 That's actually a great point. I hadn't thought of the Python syntax.\r\n\r\nIn that case my preference would be the earlier syntax that doesn't require nesting options:\r\n```js\r\ntbl.evictionCreate(\r\n  \"expire\",\r\n  \"time\", {index: \"indexName\", delay: 600, replace:fun});\r\n```\r\n\r\n@mlucy Would you be ok with that?"
