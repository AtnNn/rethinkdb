      "In an offline discussion with @mlucy we thought that it might be nice to present expiration as an instance of \"document eviction\". An index+delay pair would be one type of \"trigger\" for expiration. In the future, we could have other types of eviction triggers such as one based on the total table size.\r\n\r\nThe API would be something like this:\r\n```js\r\ntable.evictionCreate(name, triggerSpec[, replacer])\r\ntable.evictionList()\r\ntable.evictionDrop(name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe part that I don't have a great idea for yet is the format of the `triggerSpec`. I'll think about it a bit and come up with a full proposal. It could be something along the lines of an object\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  type: \"time\",\r\n  index: indexName,\r\n  delay: number\r\n}\r\n```\r\nfor the time-based trigger that we are considering in this issue."
