      "I don't like that much either. We'll either need to have the full set of `tbl.timeEvictionList`, `tbl.timeEvictionDrop`, `tbl.spaceEvictionList`, `tbl.spaceEvictionDrop` then, or break the symmetry between create one the one hand and list/drop oeprations on the other hand if we want to share the latter across eviction types.\r\n\r\nWhat if the type argument was not positional, but was a named option instead?\r\n```js\r\ntbl.evictionCreate(\r\n  \"expire\",\r\n  {trigger: \"time\", delay: 600, index: \"indexName\", replace: fun});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould you like that better?"
