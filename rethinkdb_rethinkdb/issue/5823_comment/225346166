      "+1 for delay. It also makes it clear that the value is of time unit, as well as indicating what a positive value entails.\r\n\r\nI also like the multi variant suggested by @mlucy, it would make it possible to implement two-step expirations (or more), e.g. a \"soft\" expiration (delay=10) which simply tags the document as \"old\" and then a \"hard\" expiration (delay=50) which deletes it. I can see this to be useful."
