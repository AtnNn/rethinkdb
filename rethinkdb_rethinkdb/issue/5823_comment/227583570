      "@danielmewes -- for some reason using a string as a positional parameter to pick between two options feels really wrong to me.  It feels even more wrong because it affects what optargs are legal, which is kinda weird.\r\n\r\nMaybe this should just be two functions?  `tbl.timeEvictionCreate` and then later we can add `tbl.spaceEvictionCreate`?"
