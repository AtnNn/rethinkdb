      "After thinking about it a bit, I think we definitely want to push people toward re-using indexes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDo we only want a single expiration function per index?  (Also, what happens if the index is deleted or renamed or something?  Should the expiration function silently disappear, or should we open an issue in the web UI?)\r\n\r\nAlso, if the replace function is optional, should we maybe consider making it an optarg?\r\n\r\nAlso also, if we made the index an optarg it would be clearer what it is.\r\n\r\nAn alternative interface which allows for multiple expiration functions on a single index would be something like `table.expirationCreate(my_expiration, {index: 'timestamp', offset: r.year(), replacer: function(...) { return ...;}})`."
