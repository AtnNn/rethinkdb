      "Actually, I take it back.  In the proposal-as-written, the index needs to be compared *directly* to `r.now`, so I think most of the time people will have an index they actually use on a `timestamp` field, and then an entirely separate index on something like `timestamp + 1 year` that they use for expiration but never query.\r\n\r\nI think I like the idea of rolling the functionality into `indexCreate` strictly better than the idea of always creating an index, though, since it lets us re-use a term and makes the performance implications clear.  I also like both of those better now that I think people will almost always be creating a new index specifically for the purposes of expiration.\r\n\r\n"
