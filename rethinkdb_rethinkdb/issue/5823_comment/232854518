      "@ha1331 That is quite a different use case, and sounds more like a task scheduler. We had occasionally discussed this internally, but I'm not sure if there's currently an issue for it. In general I think it's something that's further down on the list of features we want to add, because it can be implemented similarly well with existing tools like `cron` or `at` on Unix."
