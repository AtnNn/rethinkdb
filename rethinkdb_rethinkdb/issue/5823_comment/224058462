      "> ... there's the question for example if creating an expiration hook should automatically create the corresponding index ...\r\n\r\n@danielmewes good point. I'm tempted to say `expirationCreate` should take a field or function style argument like `indexCreate`, create the corresponding index automatically, and we just shouldn't even bother allowing you to use an existing index.\r\n\r\nAt some point in the future, once we can actually introspect secondary index functions, we could ensure duplicate indices on a table end up as \"aliases\" instead. That way there's no performance impact to creating multiple named indices on the same field (also useful for rethinkdb/horizon#120).\r\n\r\n> ... and whether that index should be hidden from the usual index commands\r\n\r\nI'm not totally sure on this part, but I think if dropping an \"expiration index\" also drops the corresponding \"expiration function\" then making them visible makes sense. Otherwise, I think they should probably be hidden."
