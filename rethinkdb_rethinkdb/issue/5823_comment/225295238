      "> Also, something to think about: at least one person is going to accidentally delete all their data by creating one of these on a `timestamp` index instead of a `timestamp + 1 year` index.\r\n\r\nI think in general this might be hard to catch, because we would have to know what the `timestamp` field contains. Having an expiration function on a plain field in general is very reasonable, since the field could be an `expire_at` field."
