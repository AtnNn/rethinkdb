      "@marshall007 There's no technical limitation. Your usage example sounds reasonable, so I'm on board with allowing multiple of these.\r\n\r\nI'd like to think a bit more about the configuration API for that. I don't think you'll ever want more than one per index, so one could theoretically think of expiration hooks as being a property of an index. I don't think we should necessarily present them that way, because they are really separate concepts and functionalities. But there's the question for example if creating an expiration hook should automatically create the corresponding index, and whether that index should be hidden from the usual index commands."
