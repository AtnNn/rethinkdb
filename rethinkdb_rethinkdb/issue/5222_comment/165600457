      "@danielmewes - yes, this was to implement 'dense' indexes.  The index creation function I'm using is:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table(this.name).indexCreate(index_id, (row) =>\r\n  r.expr(fields).map((field_name) => row(field_name).default(r.minval)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we could create indexes with a flag such that this works without `r.minval`, I would be ok with that.  It would be nice to be able to differentiate between `field == null` and `field is missing`."
