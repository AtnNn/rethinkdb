      "I don't know if removing it is a good idea.  We added the check for the specific reason that if we wound up not linking it correctly, we'd suffer significant performance degradation -- and it's easy to not notice if you aren't linking it correctly, because the program will still run.  If we're dynamically linking tcmalloc, can we do that and ensure the executable will not run if tcmalloc isn't present?  (I.e. can we ensure that it can't possibly use the gnu malloc?)\r\n\r\nIs there any reason not to always statically link tcmalloc?"
