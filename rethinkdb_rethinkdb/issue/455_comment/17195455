      "I agree with @srh. I thought the idea here was to remove different groups of static libs and only support two (e.g. things we always link statically, and linking *everything* statically). In particular, we should always link tcmalloc statically and always check that it's present or otherwise fail the build, because of the reasons @srh outlined above."
