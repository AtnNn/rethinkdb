      "Hi @alimoeeny,\r\n\r\nThis is more than a problem with JS, unfortunately, it's a problem with JSON.  JSON only has one numeric type, and for compatibility reasons we basically had to choose double-precision floating point numbers to be that numeric type, which means that RethinkDB stores all numbers as double-precision floats internally.\r\n\r\nThere's been talk of supporting other numeric types as pseudotypes (e.g. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3407), but that isn't currently scheduled."
