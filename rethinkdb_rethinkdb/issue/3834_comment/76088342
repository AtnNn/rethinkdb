      "Well, I could see three possible interpretations:\r\n* Drivers shouldn't support `int64`.\r\n* Drivers should support `int64` but should refuse to serialize values that the database won't be able to losslessly deserialize.\r\n* Drivers should serialize whatever they want as long as they do it losslessly, and the server should be responsible for erroring if it can't preserve the full precision.\r\n\r\nWe're currently in the process of changing the JSON parser on the server for performance reasons, and we could look into the third option as part of that, but for now I think it would be best for drivers not to serialize unsafe values."
