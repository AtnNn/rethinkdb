      "It's not necessarily the right way to do this.  For example, we might still be holding values on the server too long when a map that evaluates a complicated func_t happens.  For example, maybe the right interface is a next() call that returns a `promise_t<counted_t<const datum_t> >`, which, if already pulsed, means the value's available immediately, but if not, it means the value is currently being evaluated.  Maybe it's something else."
