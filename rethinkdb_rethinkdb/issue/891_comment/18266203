      "The reason why we picked this default is because it's a default state of affairs for JSON. People often import existing JSON data into Rethink, and having case-sensitive keys would yield very surprising results (it wouldn't play well with existing systems at all).\r\n\r\nThat being said, I completely understand where you're coming from, and a few other users brought this up. I don't like the idea of messing with specific commands (it would be very hard to keep things consistent, and would require adding this option everywhere), but I really like the idea of `r.table('foo').lowerKeys()` (function name is of course subject for debate).\r\n\r\nHow urgent/important is this for you? We're going to be making many ReQL changes soon, so getting a sense of urgency would help us immensely in prioritizing.\r\n\r\nEDIT: another question is how `lowerKeys` should deal with nested keys (e.g. should it go deep into the documents or stay shallow) We could introduce an optional `deep` argument to this function, which would probably be good enough for most users.\r\n\r\nEDIT2: if `deep` is set to true, should it also recurse into arrays?"
