      "Hmm, so I was imagining that `r.table(\"foo\").lowerKeys()` was a query you could run which would replace all of the keys with a `toLower` version of themselves rather than a modifier that let you use a table with all of the keys as their lower case counterparts which is what it seems like you're seeing here @neumino. How are other people seeing this?"
