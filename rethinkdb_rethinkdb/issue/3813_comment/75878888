      "> Are you sure? .unshard() is only called from cluster_namespace_interface_t, which runs on the same machine as the parser. (Except for sindex status queries, but those are bullshit anyway.)\r\n\r\nI might be wrong about that; I thought someone told me once that we call the unshard visitor once to unshard all the hash shard results, then send the new values over the network and call the visitor again to unshard all the range shard results."
