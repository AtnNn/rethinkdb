      "> I thought someone told me once that we call the unshard visitor once to unshard all the hash shard results\r\n\r\nI think we used to do that, but now we treat hash shards and range shards the same at the level we're talking about.\r\n\r\n> It bothers me mostly because it means that the unshard visitor has to be able to construct a functioning ReQL environment in order to execute code.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't bother me because I consider the unshard visitor part of ReQL. Maybe it just boils down to a difference between our coding styles."
