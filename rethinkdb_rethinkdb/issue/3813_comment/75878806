      "> Will this work correctly even if the table is reconfigured or rebalanced? This sounds like a situation where breaking the abstraction I described above could lead to bugs.\r\n\r\nWe'll probably have to be more clever, but probably most of the new cleverness will have to happen anyway to make changefeeds work during a rebalance.  (The specific thing I was referencing was supporting `return_initial` for changefeeds on tables, which causes us to have to read from the table in multiple batches and reconcile the reads we do with incoming changes we're receiving from that shard.)"
