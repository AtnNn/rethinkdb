      "Hi @leolorenzoluis, I think the query is timing out, which is something specific to the Data Explorer.\r\n\r\nI recommend running the query with a different client (e.g. with the node.js REPL, or with Python), as the other official clients are not affected by this.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2316\r\n\r\nThe particular error message you're getting \"Query terminated by an unknown cause\" is not correct though. We've seen this happening before with Data Explorer timeouts, but haven't been able to find out why the wrong error message is shown. @Tryneus is there any particular information that @leolorenzoluis could provide for helping us with figuring out why the wrong interruption cause is generated?"
