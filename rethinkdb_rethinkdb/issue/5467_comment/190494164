      "> Keep `--bind` for simplicity, but disallow its use as soon as any of the other arguments is used (to avoid confusion and potentially dangerous misconfiguration)\r\n\r\nI think the least surprising behavior would be for `--bind` options to specify the default behavior, while `--bind-*` options override that behavior for that port.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nrethinkdb --bind all --bind-cluster 192.168.0.1\r\n```\r\n - The cluster port is bound only on the loopback and `192.168.0.1` interfaces\r\n - The http and driver ports are bound on all available interfaces\r\n\r\nThat said, I do not feel too strongly about this."
