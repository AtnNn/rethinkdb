      "I am aware of the error types. But overall, I'm not a big fan of hierarchies. A single error type with string error codes would work for me.\r\n\r\nAnd if you wanted a hierarchy, you could always just create that structure in the strings themselves:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndatabase.table.exists\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nquery.malformed\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't really need to update clients at all. Unless you wanted to have localized error messages for all of the error codes..."
