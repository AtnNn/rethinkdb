      "Hi @aderyabin, thanks for opening an issue for this.\r\nWe've discussed the idea before, and decided to implement a fine-grained error type hierarchy in the medium term (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4223 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/559).\r\n\r\nI'm considering giving this a second discussion though, since adding lots and lots of error types is actually quite a bit of work, both on the server and especially on all the clients.\r\nAdding error codes to each error message is probably a lot easier to do.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to use a distinct error code for each type of message, and to use error types to group errors into meaningful groups. The rule of thumb would be to have an error type whenever a typical user might want to handle that group of errors differently from other errors, while having error codes in (the probably rare) case that more fine-grained error handling is required.\r\n\r\nPutting this up as a proposal for 2.3 so we can discuss it."
