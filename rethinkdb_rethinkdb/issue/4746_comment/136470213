      "@chrisvariety @hueniverse this is only recently the case. Prior to 2.1 it was always much faster to drop and recreate databases/tables than it would be to call `table.delete()` (especially for large tables, see #1762 and #134). Once this issue is resolved, dropping and recreating will probably still be the way to go."
