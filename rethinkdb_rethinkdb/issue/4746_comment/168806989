      "In `next` as of 2a19d3e, will be in 2.3.\r\n\r\nTime is down to 300-500ms typical table create times. I still think we can improve this further with more effort (<50ms seems like a good goal), but this change brings us back on par with the pre-raft code.\r\n\r\nOur own `test/rql_test/test_runner -j6` sped up from 566 seconds to 393 seconds with this change. Woo!"
