      "Yeah, truncating between tests is a non-starter. If you have multiple files testing against a rethink instance, and you don't want to leave any mess behind when you run your tests, then you'll incur the 2-3s penalty for _at least_ every file/suite you run. In my case that's at least 30s of dead time for each full test run. "
