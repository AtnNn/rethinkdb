      "I actually think this should be in 2.3. This isn't a showstopper, but it's immediately visible to literally every user, and is very frustrating (especially when testing). We have a good track record of fixing simple issues in polish, but more complicated ones tend to get punted, and I think this one we should *actually* fix asap."
