      "With #2541 fixed, this appears to have improved somewhat. Rather than decreasing to ~4k inserts/s, it now remains at ~14k/s.\r\n\r\nWhat's still odd is that there appears to be an asymmetry between magneto and electro. After a while, magneto is writing much more slowly to the SSDs than electro is (~40MB/s vs. ~100MB/s), and its garbage ratio is much higher. The GC ratio decreases when I pause the client, so GC appears to be working correctly. Just slower on magneto for some reason (or inserts are reaching magneto faster than electro, not sure).\r\nThis could just be a consequence of slightly unbalanced shards, or of the SSDs in magneto and electro being in different condition."
