      "An update: fixing this exposed another more serious bug with our garbage-collection (in the process of fixing the backtraces I added an extra field to `pb_rcheckable_t` which exposed a use-after-free bug).  I don't want to merge the fix for this into 1.4.x until the garbage collection issue is resolved, which I think I should be able to finish on Friday.\r\n\r\n@mfenniak -- that means this fix will probably be in 1.4.4 instead of 1.4.3."
