      "I think the examples and use cases you outlined above are *excellent*. I went from having absolutely no understanding about functions and their uses to feeling very confident just by using the above posts, as well as when/why to use javascript forms. If the above posts were consolidated into a single page, I'm fairly confident it would help a lot of people (certainly more than no docs at all ;-)).\r\n\r\nOne thing that still isn't clear is why passing a TermAssoc object with the value `{\"AVG\": \"myfield\"}` actually works (same with sum and count), I'm assuming this is just short-hand for \"use the built-in average/sum/count function.\" This is more driver-specific though, and not necessarily in direct relation to the understanding of functions."
