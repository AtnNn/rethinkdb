      "@orthecreedence -- javascript doesn't support operator overloading so you can't do something like `user('age') / 16`. That won't work in javascript. You'd have to do `user('age').div(16)` or `r.div(user('age'), 16)` (both work).\r\n\r\nIn python, which supports operator overloading, you can say `user('age') / 16` and things will work."
