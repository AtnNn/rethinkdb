      "Wow, that was fast! \r\n\r\nMy main question is (and this was partially answered on the IRC channel) how do I pass a value to the anonymous function I create?\r\n\r\nSo I can create the function on the client:\r\n\r\n```\r\nargs {\r\n  type: FUNC\r\n  args {\r\n    type: MAKE_ARRAY\r\n    args {\r\n      type: DATUM\r\n      datum {\r\n        type: R_NUM\r\n        r_num: 1\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  args {\r\n    type: MAKE_OBJ\r\n    optargs {\r\n      key: \"AVG\"\r\n      val {\r\n        type: VAR\r\n        args {\r\n          type: DATUM\r\n          datum {\r\n            type: R_NUM\r\n            r_num: 1\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's all fine, I can easily generate that form in the query language, but then how do I execute something like that? So if I'm doing an average on a field name, how do I pass that field name in, and is there anything special I have to do? For instance do I have to wrap the IMPLICIT_VAR and GETATTR and pass that in as the function argument?"
