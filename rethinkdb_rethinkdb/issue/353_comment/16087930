      "Sorry, one more question. I really don't get the variable numbering, and why the client needs to track this (or even what it's for). Is there any info on what the var numbering is for, and also is there a specific numbering scheme I should use, or do I just increment the value each time a function is executed?\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!"
