      "This makes a *lot* of sense, thanks for explaining. I understand now why you went the route of deconstructing functions like you did, so you could determine how distributable a query is. You guys sure know your stuff. It's funny, coming from Mongo, your query language is so much more powerful right off the bat. It's taking a bit to wrap my head around it (as far as building a driver) but now that I'm understanding it more I see the power.\r\n\r\nThanks, everyone, for the quick responses and helping me out. I'm making good progress on this driver and you'll soon have yet another supported language to add to the list!"
