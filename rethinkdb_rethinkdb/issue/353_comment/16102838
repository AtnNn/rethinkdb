      "Ok, that's starting to make sense, thank you. Is it possible to just say \"screw it\" and instead of constructing a bunch of function forms use a `JAVASCRIPT` term? The language I'm using (common lisp) has a library that's able to accurately convert a subset of itself to javascript, and being able to expose this through the driver would allow converting anonymous functions from lisp to something Rethink could understand very easy...assuming that's what the `JAVASCRIPT` term is for."
