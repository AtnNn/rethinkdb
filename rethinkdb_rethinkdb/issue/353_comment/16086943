      "This is the one part of the documentation I'm having a lot of trouble with. Between the 1.4 spec and the documentation, I was able to build a driver for just about everything except the avg/sum/count commands. Even a very basic writeup on lambdas (how to construct them, *and* how to call them) would be very helpful."
