      "Anything that can cause a shard to lose its changefeed server between sending the `changefeed_subscribe_t` and sending the `changefeed_stamp_t`.  It's possible that resharding is the only thing that can cause that, but I'm not sure.  It should always be caused by a cluster event, though.  (For example, I wouldn't be shocked if there was a specific timing scenario where a server hosting a shard crashing and then quickly coming back up could cause this, although I think that will probably always trigger a \"changefeed disconnected\" error instead.)\r\n\r\nTheoretically you can also get that error if the changefeed client that's trying to do the stamp somehow unregistered itself from the changefeed server before the stamp arrived, but I think if that happens the user should get an error from whatever unregistered it instead of this error."
