      "Err, I think my previous message was wrong. The definition of `all_replicas_ready` is that *all* the replicas for a given table are ready, which means it wouldn't work in case of server failure.\r\n\r\nLet me chat with some folks on Monday who *actually* know all the edge cases of this stuff, and report back. We'll also improve the docs to make everything more clear."
