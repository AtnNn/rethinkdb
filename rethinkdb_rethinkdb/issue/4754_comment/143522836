In particular, suppose I\nhave a cluster with 3 nodes and every table has 3 replicas.  Then I kill\none of the nodes and wait five minutes (say).  Is \"all_replicas_ready\"\nsupposed to be true then (since node 3 will have been removed completely)?\n       In particular, should automatic failover in the case of losing one\nnode (assuming I have enough replicas) still work and allow my changefeeds\nto work again?\n\nWilliam\n\n\n> \8212\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4754#issuecomment-143521087>\n> .\n>\n\n\n\n-- \nWilliam (http://wstein.org)\n"
