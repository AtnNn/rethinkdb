      "@Tryneus talked about this yesterday. I was wondering if we want to have an API for this in the WebUI as well as commandline. Basically as I understand the proposal you'd say something like:\r\n\r\n    rethinkdb backup --join ... --table foo\r\n\r\nAnd it will create files which act as backups.\r\n\r\nI think it'd be cool if you could also just go in to the WebUI and on the table view set backup options such as \"back this table up every day\" or something. The system would then pick a machine (or perhaps the user should pick the machine) which wasn't doing anything else for the table and put periodic backups on it.\r\n\r\nThis seems a bit nicer to use but it also has the advantage that since the backup node is part of the cluster. You can then display within each table view a list of available snap shots and with one click revert to one of those snapshots (or spin a snapshot off as a separate table.) This last part might be outside the minimum viable but we should probably think about it as well as the CLI api right now."
