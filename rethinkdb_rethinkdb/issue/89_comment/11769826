      "Here's a cool idea: since all database updates are append-only... then if you don't compact/garbage collect you can theoretically go back to any point-in-time (just discard changes after that in the file?)\r\n\r\nThis would make for a much more granular incremental backup. And you can have some sort of incremental compacting to compact everything before a certain date (or merge patches between a certain date?) to be more monthly/weekly/hourly getting less granular the farther back you go.\r\n\r\nIt's a different feature set, but it sounds like some/all of this is already implemented in the code.. is this possible/useful?"
