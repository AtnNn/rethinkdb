      "The basic API outline makes perfect sense, but I think we should document a precise proposal. E.g. how to do incremental vs. full backup, how to do incremental restore, etc.\r\n\r\nI talked to @Tryneus about the webUI extension yesterday. I think it's a higher-order feature that we should do a bit differently. I'll send an e-mail about this offline because the ideas are highly experimental (tm)."
