        "It should be possible to check the status of a server through the ReQL admin API. I assume this will be in the form of a pseudo-table, but we might decide on something different. For the sake of discussion, let's assume a table called `rethinkdb.server_status`. Its rows would look something like:\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"us_east_1\",\r\n    \"status\": \"ready\",\r\n    \"hostname\": \"ip-1-2-3-4.ec2.internal\",\r\n    \"pid\": 13328,\r\n    \"ips\": [\"1.2.3.4\"],\r\n    \"reql_port\": 28015,\r\n    \"cluster_port\": 29015,\r\n    \"http_admin_port\": 8080,\r\n    \"running_since\": datetime(...),\r\n    \"connected_since\": datetime(...),\r\n    \"num_replicas\": 83,\r\n    \"num_directors\": 33\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf the server was down, then `status` would be `\"missing\"`, some of the fields would be absent, and there would be a new field called `missing_since`.\r\n\r\nIn the above example, I listed as many fields as I could think of; this might be overkill. The only essential fields are `name` and `status`. @larkost notes that the `*_port` fields would be useful for testing."
