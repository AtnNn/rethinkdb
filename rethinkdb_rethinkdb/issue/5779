        "Is there a known mechanism to specify the index into a lambda of a filter function? or can this type of query be map reduced / concatMap in some way?\r\n\r\nqueries specially the count() are taking 40 minutes to compute in my database. I want to prevent Full table scans as much as possible, but the filter function doesn't seem to allow this kind of optimization. \r\n\r\nas you know getAll() can accept the index hint but it's the opposite to what i really want (a NOT IN)\r\n\r\nexample: \r\nr.db('my_db').table('left_table')\r\n   .filter(function (left) {\r\n        return r.db('other_db').table('right_table')\r\n                     .hasFields('fk')\r\n                      .getField('fk')\r\n                      .contains(left('pk')).not()\r\n})\r\n\r\ntks."
