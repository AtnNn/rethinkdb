      "@weixiyen -- I have a few questions:\r\n\r\n- do you have a sense of what the database was doing at the time? (it sounds like just a range scan)\r\n- what OS/version are you running on?\r\n- would you be able to send us the data files/core file? How big is your `rethinkdb_data` directory compressed?\r\n\r\nPinging @mlucy -- could you take a look at what's going on here?\r\n\r\nAs far as recovering from error, it really depends on what's going on. In many cases you can just restart Rethink and things will work fine. You can also set up a cluster of two machines (and one replica), and just fail over when one of the machines dies to ensure high availability. I opened an issue in docs for this -- https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/264 -- we'll document this better.\r\n\r\nSorry you ran into this, we'll get to the bottom of it ASAP."
