        "Our current way of running the administrative scripts such as `export`, `restore`, and `index_rebuild` is a bit awkward in that you call `export backup` and the server uses `execvp` to call `rethinkdb-export`. That is installed only when you have the driver installed on the system, so uses the first on on `$PATH`, and uses `pkg_resources.load_entry_point` to actually start the process from the module, again found via the `$PATH`. This all makes it hard to test, and a fragile if you are in the middle of transferring from one version of RethinkDB to another.\n\nIf instead we included a `__main__.py` file, and then drove all of the commands out of that one it would mean that the driver could be called directly, even if it was not on the path (e.g.: `python -m /path/to/driver`). That would change the call from the `rethinkdb` binary to be `python -m rethinkdb export` to match what we have now. And when combined with #4507 it would use the corresponding version of the driver.\n"
