      "I'm not sure how useful this is if it's off by default. If you already have to look up the name of an argument to exclude the `rethinkdb` table, you can probably just as well add a `.filter()` behind the `dbList`.\r\n\r\nI think we should actually consider having this option on by default. It would be backwards-incompatible, but probably won't break much actual application code.\r\n\r\n2.4 is pretty full at this point and we're past the discussion period for ReQL changes. So I think we'll pick this up for 2.5."
