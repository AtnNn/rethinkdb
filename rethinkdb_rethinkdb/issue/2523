        "This function would take a string and return a URL-encoded version of that string.  In particular:   Every octet that isn't alphanumeric gets percent-encoded.  Some people might need this to validly or safely construct URLs from a query that uses data in a table.\n\nThis issue is made in reaction to a change made in the abandoned code review 1606 by @Tryneus that tried helpfully percent-escaping invalid URLs to fudge them into validity.  That was not a secure way to construct a URL.  Neither is taking user input and concatenating it without percent-escaping it, of course.\n"
