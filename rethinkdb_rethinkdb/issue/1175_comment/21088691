      "A few comments on your proposal:\r\n\r\n* In replication, progress of 1.0 doesn't necessarily mean it's done (it might take a few more seconds). I think the function should return a json object that includes a progress number, and a `status` field whose values can be `ready` and `in_progress`.\r\n* I think it's important to add a `blocking` flag because people often just want to get notified when the thing's done (as opposed to periodically polling it).\r\n* I like `index_status` more (as far as names go)."
