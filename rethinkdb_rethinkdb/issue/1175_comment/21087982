      "I've been hoping people would eventually ask for this because we can actually solve it quite nicely. As most people mentioned making index creation block isn't a good idea because it may block for days. However we can actually get pretty nice progress estimates because sindex post construction uses `btree_parallel_traversal` which already has progress reporting built in to it so it's pretty easy to do. No cracks about how unreliable those wound up being that all stemmed from the mailbox layer not the btree layer but while I'm doing this I'll take a look into why they timed out so much I bet it's pretty easy to fix.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo to make this concrete I propose we add:\r\n```\r\ntable.index_progress(name)\r\n>>> .5\r\n```"
