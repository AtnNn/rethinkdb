      "As would any sufficiently complex query. Users already have some ways to deal with long running write queries.\r\n\r\n* run it with noreply\r\n* implement a multithreaded connection pool so other queries can run while the long running query runs\r\n\r\nIn both these cases, as now, we still need a way to know when the query has completed. This is the same problem we have with db_create and table_create. Right now don't we just enumerate the tables or databases and check if the one we want is in the list?"
