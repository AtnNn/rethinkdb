      "A command to get how many documents were indexed could be enough maybe?\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"foo\").get_index_status(\"index_name\").run()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   status: \"ready\"/\"building\",\r\n   documents_indexed: X // Only if the index is building // The value can be a rough estimate\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it can provide how many document the table has, it would even be better, but that's would require more work I guess.\r\nIt also sounds reasonable to think that users roughly know how many document they have in their table."
