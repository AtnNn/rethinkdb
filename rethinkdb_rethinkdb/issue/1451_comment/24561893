      "On ubuntu the node binary is called `nodejs`. The `coffee` binary created by npm should be pointing to `nodejs` but it isn't. \r\n\r\nThe `nodejs-legacy` package provides a symlink from `node` to `nodejs`. Installing this package may fix this issue.\r\n\r\nHow did you install npm? I wonder why it isn't creating `coffee` with a working shebang."
