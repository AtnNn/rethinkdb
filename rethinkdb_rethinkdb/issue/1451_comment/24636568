      "Took your advice and used the package via apt-get, the installation went through successfully. So a big thank you to both of you.\r\nBy the way, I opted for installing from source because of my previous experience with Cassandra where installing from source is recommended due to the package autostarts after an upgrade and that Cassandra gets updated with the rest of the packages and then this may result in a client application becoming broken. Is that true that RethinkDb package acts the same way?"
