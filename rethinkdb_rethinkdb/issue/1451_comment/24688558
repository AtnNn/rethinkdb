      "RethinkDB doesn't provide a backward compatibility with older versions (that's the main reason we are not labeled \"production ready\" yet). So before updating RethinkDB, you have to migrate your data. That should be fixed in the next versions if I'm not mistaken as we are getting closer to a LTS release.\r\n\r\nIf you are worried about breaking a running app, the best way to prevent undesired update is to freeze the package.\r\nhttp://askubuntu.com/questions/18654/how-to-prevent-updating-of-a-specific-package\r\n\r\nClosing this issue. I'll fix the docs about node, nodejs and npm.\r\n"
