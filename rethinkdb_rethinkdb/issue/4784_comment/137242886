      ">  Maybe make it configurable with an options parameter?\r\n\r\nI like this interface. It seems to make the common case easy. When I think of iteration with each, I think of them executing in order. Given that you can just collect them and run them asynchronously if you want, it seems ok not to provide an option.\r\n\r\nIt looks good to me overall. I've played with the code a bit and it works like I'd expect. Since this is an api change, I'd like to let it breath for a bit before merging it. Maybe get some opinions from other js guys that hang around here like @neumino and @joaojeronimo ..."
