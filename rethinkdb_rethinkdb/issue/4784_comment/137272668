      "@larkost just added tests covering all the cases outlined in my opening comment and added a \"stop iteration early\" test to `cursor.each`. Let me know if that doesn't suffice.\r\n\r\n@deontologician somewhat unrelated to this PR, the original `cursor.each` implementation appears to read an extra row off the cursor after iteration has already been stopped. I added a fix for that and the tests still pass, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't overlooking something intentional."
