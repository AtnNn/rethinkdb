      "@deontologician -- Adding a new method seems reasonable to me and I can see how useful it can be.\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a better name than `eachAsync` since people may thing that `each` is synchronous, but I  have to admit that I can't come up with a better name.\r\nBluebird's doc calls `map(... {concurrency: 1})` a static map, but it doesn't sound good :)\r\n"
