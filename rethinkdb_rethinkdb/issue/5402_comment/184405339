      "Thanks for the (greatly written) issue report.\r\n\r\nAt some point Pypi started to automatically translate our versions to the `.postX` format. We should probably just adapt that version format for `rethinkdb.version` as well, so both versions become consistent again.\r\n\r\nI'll push a new release of the latest Python driver with the changed version format later, and post here once it's up."
