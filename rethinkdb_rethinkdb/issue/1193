        "I think we should translate it to `r.sub(0, x)` rather than introducing a `neg` operator, just because it's easier and I don't think the value of `neg` is sufficient to justify a new operator.\r\n\r\nBacktraces would show `r.sub(0, x)`, but I think this is fine; we have a lot of places in our backtraces where we show users something different from what they typed.  I think that people will be able to do the transformation back from `r.sub(0, x)` to `-x` in their head."
