      "@alexbw -- with dates out, RethinkDB now has a notion of pseudotypes (i.e. types that aren't specified by json, dates being an example). That should make this enhancement easier, but there are still some questions we need to answer about how to structured user-defined types (what's allowed, what's not allowed, how it integrates with the rest of the system, etc.)\r\n\r\nOur main priority now is to get Rethink to production-readiness, which means mainly performance, stability, and scalability fixes. I think we won't be able to get to this enhancement until 2.0 is out, but we'll almost certainly do it almost immediately after that."
