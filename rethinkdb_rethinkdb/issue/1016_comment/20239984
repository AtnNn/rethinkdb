      "@neumino I'd really prefer if you left scheduling issues to @coffeemug it's not that I want to impose a hierarchy with this process but I think scheduling things really works a lot better if one person coordinates it. Right now when an issue is in a release milestone I take this to mean 1.8 isn't shipping without this. Which just isn't the case here.\r\n\r\nOn top of this I think your reasoning for moving this is completely wrong. Adding integers, numbers with bigger precision and dates is a great feature but we certainly don't want those to be types that users have to register for themselves. We'd want those to be builtin types. They'd probably wind up using the __reql_type__ field method but we can easily do that without giving users the ability to register their own types. Registering your own types is both a fairly big api discussion and some non trivial backend work which means I think it's higher cost and lower benefit than everything else we want to do in 1.8."
