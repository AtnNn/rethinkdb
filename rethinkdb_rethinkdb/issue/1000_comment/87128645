      "I feel like it isn't entirely clear what we should actually do here for some reason.\r\n\r\nI was originally going by @coffeemug 's original description\r\n> Surprise and amaze people with developer tools for building real-time, data-driven web applications they could only dream of building, and bring sheer joy and simplicity to the process of building great software.\r\n\r\nThis I think we will get done for 2.0.\r\n\r\nHowever it's also clear that there's more to this.\r\nI think in the long term we'll have to do all of these things:\r\n* Having nothing to do with magic\r\n* Hire some wicca\r\n* Ship it with 2.0\r\n* Put it in the raft milestone\r\n* Split it up\r\n* Enclose it safely by having all the magic there\r\n* Fork an empty git repo\r\n\r\nI'll probably open separate issues for these items at some point."
