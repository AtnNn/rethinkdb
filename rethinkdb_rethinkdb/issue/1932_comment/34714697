      "@danielmewes, the HTTP API is a little different, we already disallow noreply writes.\r\n\r\n@neumino, in order to close the connection, you should do an HTTP POST request with 'close-connection' similar to how creating a connection is done with an HTTP GET with 'open-new-connection'.  I'm not super familiar with HTTP requests, but we can look at the code together if you need more information."
