      "I can change the web interface to use one connection per query. It's some work, but nothing impossible (and probably less work than changing the HTTP API behavior).\r\n\r\nWhat I'm worried about is the behavior for TCP connections. This current script currently works:\r\n```js\r\nr.connect({}, function(err, conn) {\r\n    for(var i=0; i<docs.length; i++) {\r\n        r.table(\"foo\").insert(docs[i]).run(conn, function() { .. })\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\nAll the docs get inserted. Is it still going to work after your changes?\r\n\r\nNote: This code look stupid, but it's what can happen if users use the `async` module without paying attention to the connection."
