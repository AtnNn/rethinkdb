      "So I think in `drivers/javascript/net.coffee` there should be a not before opts.noreplyWait.\r\nBut the thing is I can't send a noreplyWait before closing since I would send a second query on the same connection. So the noreplyWait is rejected by the server.\r\n\r\nCan we set noreplyWait to false by default on http connections?\r\n\r\nAlso `close` actually doesn't close the connection if we use HTTP since it doesn't call `cancel`"
