      "You're talking about through our HTTP API or over TCP?  TCP connections have always been synchronous, and if you want to run multiple queries at the same time, you use multiple connections.  I think the current behavior with the web UI is buggy, it's possible to have multiple queries running at once, but you will only ever see the latest result, and there's no way to tell how many operations are running nor is there any way to interrupt them."
