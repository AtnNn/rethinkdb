      "I have something that rougly works in branch `michel_1932_http_conn`. I still have to polish a few things like how we handle errors, but overall it works.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a server bug running around. The server can give back the same connection id to multiple connections if I quickly open them. (keeping shift+enter do the trick after a few seconds).\r\nThat's what logging `(new DataView xhr.response).getInt32(0, true)` in `/drivers/javascript/net.coffee` shows.\r\n\r\nI ran into this when inserting data with this query:\r\n```\r\nr.db('test').table('test').insert({})\r\n```\r\n\r\n@Tryneus could you take a look at it on Monday when you have some time?"
