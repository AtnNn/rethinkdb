      "Hum, so I'm currently just killing the XmlHttpRequest where the query is being run, and use `connection.cancel`, which send a request to `close-connection?conn_id=`.\r\n\r\nI tried using `connection.close` with `noreplyWait: false` but I don't see an outgoing request, so something smells fishy there. I'll look into that."
