      "@neumino, I don't see how that's possible with a quick look at the code, but I'll look into it more on Monday.  The `http_conn_cache_t::next_id` is incremented and returned each time a GET is performed with 'open-new-connection', and as far as I know, all HTTP connections are handled on thread 0 so there shouldn't be any race conditions."
