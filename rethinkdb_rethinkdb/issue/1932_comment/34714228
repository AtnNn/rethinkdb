      "I went with @Tryneus and @mlucy opinions.\r\nUsers can only run one query at a time. When a query is running, the `run` button becomes a `abort` button.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus When users click on the `abort` button, I close the XmlHttpRequest, and close the connection.\r\nThat doesn't seem to be enough to interrupt the connection. Is it a bug? Or do I have to do something else?\r\n\r\n\r\nUp in review 1197 - assigned to @mglukhovsky \r\nBranch michel_1932_single_query"
