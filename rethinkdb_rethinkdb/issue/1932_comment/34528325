      "About the current behavior you may be right. The main case is when I need concurrent queries if when I copy/populate a table -- which I guess is not the most frequent one.\r\n\r\nI was kind of reluctant to disable run (because user could end up with a \"frozen\" ui) but I can add a button to cancel a query (or reuse `run`).\r\nBy the way, now people can't cancel a query.\r\n\r\nWhat do other people think?\r\n\r\nOn a side note, if we disable concurrent queries that would make the code a ton simpler. And we won't have to deal with this connection id bug (I would test it with TCP connection though)."
