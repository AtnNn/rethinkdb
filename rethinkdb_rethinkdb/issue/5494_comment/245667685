      "Would be pretty neat to have the Web UI pull in table schemas to inform the Data Explorer with additional/smarter completion. Even something super basic to start like always autocompleting `r.row` and `bracket` terms (ignoring their context) with fields in the schema for the table in the current query would go a long way."
