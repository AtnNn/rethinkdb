      "* For table-level schema validation, I favor option 2\r\n* I think type coercion should not happen by default, but it'd be nice to have an optarg for this. Also an optarg that lets you choose whether additional properties are merely stripped versus causing validation failure\r\n* For psuedotypes, I think $ref is the correct approach. We should have standard names for our RethinkDB psuedotypes that you can use in a $ref\r\n* I don't think migration is strictly necessary. I definitely think it should be possible to modify documents in ways that don't conform with the schema. In fact, it might even be useful to have optargs for write operations that tell RethinkDB to bypass the schema for a given operation\r\n\r\nI'm pretty excited to see this moving forward. \128077 "
