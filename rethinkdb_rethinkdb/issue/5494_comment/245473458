      "-1 on automatic value coercion. I think this behavior can confuse people, particularly around values like `0` which can coerce to unexpected values and lead to application bugs. Automatic coercion are huge issues in MySQL and Javascript. If you do go down this path, definitely check out an existing list of rules [such as this one](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv/blob/master/COERCION.md).\r\n\r\nI would recommend no schema migration either. Folks are free to update their write hook as schema changes occur.\r\n\r\nRegarding native JSON-schema types, the `format` option seems the cleanest to me, but my opinion is weakly held. I think accepting ISO8601 date format is a great idea overall. You may also want to consider UUID, which is technically a string but formatted in a specific manner.\r\n\r\nAlso note JSON-schema has multiple versions, so you'll want to be explicit with what version you are supporting. I believe v4 is the most widely used."
