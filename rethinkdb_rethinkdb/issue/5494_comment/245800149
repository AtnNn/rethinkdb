      "@segphault the problem with using `$ref` for pseudotypes is that it will bomb on json-schema clients that don't support overloading the behavior of that attribute. On the other hand, `format` is supposed to be ignored when the client doesn't support the attribute and/or keyword. Per [spec](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html#anchor105):\r\n\r\n> A format attribute can generally only validate a given set of instance types. If the type of the instance to validate is not in this set, validation for this format attribute and instance SHOULD **succeed**.\r\n> ...\r\n> Implementations MAY add custom format attributes. Save for agreement between parties, schema authors SHALL NOT expect a peer implementation to support this keyword and/or custom format attributes.\r\n\r\n`format` definitely offers the most flexibility for users in defining their schema and portability across client implementations."
