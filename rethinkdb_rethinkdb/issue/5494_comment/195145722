      "Just as an inspiration, I'm using Joi(https://github.com/hapijs/joi) which provides a DSL similar to ReQL to validate schema rules and also return the final object with the types correctly coerced.\r\n\r\nTake a look into a schema I'm using in production: https://gist.github.com/thelinuxlich/5d0b8dcb1a5a791838dc\r\n\r\nI import this into a authorization middleware and execute ```Joi.validate(params, schema)```. Then I can rest assured that nothing strange gets saved into RethinkDB documents."
