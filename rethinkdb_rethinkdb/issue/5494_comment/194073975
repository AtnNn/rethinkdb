      "I'm going to put this into `subsequent` for now.\r\n\r\nI think there are a bunch of open questions here that make it more reasonable to implement this in Horizon for now, mostly because we are more flexible there when it comes to amending and changing how schema validation works at a later point.\r\n\r\nLong term though I think this should definitely be a core RethinkDB feature. A JSON schema term would work great as a per-table validation function, as proposed in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4210 ."
