      "Hey, so I put together this fork of thinky called [thinkagain](https://github.com/mbroadst/thinkagain) which supports json-schema as its model definition format. The more I work through my projects using rethinkdb, the more I think I wouldn't need the ODM at all if I could get validation on the driver/database level. I'm very much in support of this proposal, but I wonder if an interesting first step might be to develop an exploratory fork of the JS driver (or more likely rethinkdbdash) that implements support for schemas. I think this could help out with #5879 as well.\r\n\r\nWould anybody be interested in this, or more importantly helping me out with this?"
