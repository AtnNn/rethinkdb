      "Hi @lukaszkorecki , we're actually trying to get away from having specialized HTTP APIs on the server, as it adds additional code complexity.\r\n\r\nIt should be pretty easy to write a node.js or Python script that queries `r.db('rethinkdb').table('stats')` from the RethinkDB server and exposes it through an HTTP server.\r\nWould that work for you?\r\n\r\nOur long-term plan is to support \"plugins\" as described in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4785 , which among other things could expose HTTP APIs for various purposes and would run directly on the server."
