      "@danielmewes Plugin system looks really cool  that's what makes RabbitMQ or Elasticsearch shine and also keeps the core pretty small. \r\n\r\n(I'm not a fan of depending on node/npm but that's just my personal opinion ;-)\r\n\r\nAs for monitoring - at least with collectd - you can extend it with python (or anything really, through `exec` plugin) and push down query results to the collector. Of course that's still not as accessible as driver-less access to the db stats. So that will work for us.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll follow the plugin issue - some of the ideas there are really interesting.\r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\n"
