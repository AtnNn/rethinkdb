      "I think this \"While there is no hard limit on the size of a single document, there is a recommended limit of 16MB for memory performance reasons.\" is the best lead. RethinkDB stores documents to the disk in chunks of 512B, so it might be possible there is no set max length for strings. I base this only on the fact that no such max length has been defined/documented."
