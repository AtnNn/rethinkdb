      "Hi J\225n,\n\nas Henrik suggested there is indeed no limit on the length of a string,\napart from the size of memory on your server.\n\nNote that there is however a limit of 64 MB on the size of a single query,\nso you cannot actually transfer a string larger than that to the server in\none piece. Retrieving strings larger than 64 MB should work fine though.\n\nNote that large documents above 16 MB haven't been tested very thoroughly\nand while there shouldn't be any crashes, there might be performance and/or\nresource consumption issues.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nBest,\n  Daniel\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 9, 2015 at 5:14 AM, Henrik Andersson <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> I think this \"While there is no hard limit on the size of a single\n> document, there is a recommended limit of 16MB for memory performance\n> reasons.\" is the best lead. RethinkDB stores documents to the disk in\n> chunks of 512B, so it might be possible there is no set max length for\n> strings. I base this only on the fact that no such max length has been\n> defined/documented.\n>\n> \8212\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4360#issuecomment-110334893>\n> .\n>\n"
