      "Comparing the binary index function should work, but whenever you get different string representations in `indexStatus`, you're also going to have different binary representations. The string representation is deterministically generated from the binary one.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that the binary representation I think is different depending on which version of RethinkDB the index was created with (because it contains a version tag unless I'm mistaken). So if you want to be able to compare indexes across RethinkDB versions, using the string will likely work better.\r\n\r\n@aihornmac Do you have an example where two semantically identical index functions look different in the printed `indexStatus` string?"
