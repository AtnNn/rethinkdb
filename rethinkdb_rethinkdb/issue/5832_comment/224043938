      "Note that RethinkDB is not intended to be accessed directly by users of your application / chat system. RethinkDB's security model is insufficient for that usage scenario.\r\n\r\nYou might want to check out Horizon (http://www.horizon.io), which is intended for that scenario. It uses websockets underneath. Horizon is pretty new, and we haven't done any benchmarks of battery usage yet."
