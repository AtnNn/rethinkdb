      "@sagivf `slice` is already implemented, so it's going to ship with RethinkDB 2.3.0. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4227\r\n\r\nI'm not sure when we'll ship the `trim` term. We first need to discuss and agree on the API, which is going to happen for one of the upcoming releases (we have a special \"ReQL discussion period\" at the beginning of each release cycle)."
