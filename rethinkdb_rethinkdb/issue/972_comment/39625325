      "I don't quite like \"UNPRINTABLE\" because it raises a question of why the thing can't be printed. I mean, it's a computer. It can print anything :) Just saying \"SELECTION\" seems to be enough. Nobody would question why it's printable or unprintable -- they'll just think that something happened on a selection (which is what you want them to think).\r\n\r\n"
