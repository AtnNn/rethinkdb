      "I think we should keep that part, because it tells people what selection we found.  (E.g. they may have a selection on `r.table('users')` and another selection on `r.table('comments')`, and this would tell them which one it is.)  This is even more useful for other opaque values like tables.\r\n\r\nI think we should just remove the word \"OPAQUE\" and call it a day."
