      "Hello @philips \r\n\r\nThis is similar to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1756\r\n\r\n> A table is \"Live\" only if every shards have enough replicas up to date to meet the number of acks required, which mean a table can be \"Live\" even if it's replicating.\r\n\r\nBasically, if a table is \"Live\", it means that it should eventually become available without manual intervention. \r\n\r\n\r\nIs it a table that you just created? The table shouldn't be listed as \"master not available\" and \"Live\" for a long time.\r\nMaybe we should just replace the code that compute the \"Live\" status with the code used in the dashboard? It's a little heavier to compute if a table is available though as we have to go through the whole directory."
