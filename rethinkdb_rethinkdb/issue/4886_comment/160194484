      "@stellanhaglund My problem was that I have a code that connects to the database, execute some query and then when I have results or error I close the connection - `conn.close()`. When you have changefeeds you want to keep the connection open. Do you close the connection manually somewhere in you code? If you don't it's probably another issue."
