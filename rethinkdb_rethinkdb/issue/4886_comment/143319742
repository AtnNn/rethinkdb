      "Hi @stellanhaglund, which client is this with? Is anything else going on in the application that might cause the connection to be closed?\r\nCould you check if there are any messages in the RethinkDB server_log? The log file is usually located inside the rethinkdb_data directory, unless configured differently. You can also access the log through the web UI or by reading from the `r.db('rethinkdb').table('logs')` table."
