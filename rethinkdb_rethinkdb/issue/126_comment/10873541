      "The only problem with the pull requests is that they lose comments when a\r\nnew version is posted. Also sam doesn't like the inline comments. I think\r\nthe first problem is terrible, the second is annoying but maybe workable.\r\nIf it weren't for those I'd like pull requests because they integrate\r\nreally well. You can just pull the code down for yourself and run it which\r\nis great and it's easy to bring Tim or other outside people in on a review.\r\n\r\nGithub seems to be great at coming up with features doing almost everything\r\nneeded to make them usable and having 1-2 huge oversights that they just\r\nnever fix.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Nov 29, 2012 at 4:35 PM, coffeemug <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Let me just go out on a limb here and point out that you folks seem to\r\n> like GitHub's pull request system much more than CodeCollaborator.\r\n>\r\n> \8212\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub<https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/126#issuecomment-10873397>.\r\n>\r\n>"
