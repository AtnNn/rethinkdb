      "This is the expected behavior.  If you `orderBy` a field we load the whole table into memory at once to sort it.  The `stream` type is only for data we can generate lazily (usually by reading off disk).\r\n\r\nThis is good for three reasons:\r\n* We want to enforce the array size limit on the result of unindexed `orderBy`s, and the most straightforward way to do that is to return an array.\r\n* We want users to be able to figure out the performance characteristics of their queries by looking at the result type (arrays are eager, streams are lazy).\r\n* If we returned a stream here we'd have to keep the extra data around in memory while sending batches, which means a user who opened a cursor on `table.orderBy('field')` and then didn't consume the whole thing would be taking up a huge amount of memory on the server indefinitely."
