      "BTW, that query would become dramatically simpler once we implement support for multiple aggregators (#1725).\r\n\r\nAlso, we could make the grouping aspect much more pleasant by adding a convenient command for truncating time. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nr.now().toEpochTime(units='hours').floor()\r\n```\r\n\r\n(or something of that sort -- there might be an even more convenient way of doing it)"
