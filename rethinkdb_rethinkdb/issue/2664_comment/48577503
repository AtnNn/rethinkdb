      "* Look at how the SCADA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) folks do things.\r\n* Decimation of data, with the ability to IIR or FIR filter or the like.\r\n* Ability to specify the interval between samples.\r\n  * Ability to have higher sampling rates overlaid on low sample rates.\r\n    * High speed data loggers use this to capture interesting events in high resolution during long periods of uninteresting data.\r\n* Alternate encoding schemes.\r\n  * Record based on time between quanta. \r\n    * Good for long running data that changes infrequently.\r\n    * If you query for a time between two samples you should return the stored value from the earlier sample.\r\n* http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/PAKDD_05.pdf is interesting maybe useful for an index.\r\n\r\n"
