        "When you supply something other than `r.count` or `r.sum(field)` or `r.avg(field)` the server returns the message \"Invalid data collector\" which doesn't provide the user with enough information to fix the error. Given that there are a finite number of acceptable values (rather than a type or set of types allowable) I think it should add something like \"Data collector argument must be one of ...` and list the possible options."
