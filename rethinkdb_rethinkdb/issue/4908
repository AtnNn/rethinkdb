        "Currently, to the best of my knowledge (and please correct me if I've missed something), the only way to handle certain types of potentially expected errors is to examine the message that's returned with the error. Eg:\n\n```\n{\n  message: \"Database `XXX` already exists in:\8629r.dbCreate(\"XXX\")\8629^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\",\n  msg: \"Database `XXX` already exists.\",\n  name: \"RqlRuntimeError\"\n}\n```\n\nIt would be very helpful to have something like:\n\n```\n{\n  message: \"Database `XXX` already exists in:\8629r.dbCreate(\"XXX\")\8629^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\",\n  msg: \"Database `XXX` already exists.\",\n  name: \"RqlRuntimeError\",\n  code: \"database exists\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere code is any predictable, short, preferably human-readable code that could be compared against.\n\nEven better might me something like this with additional, easily machine-readable metadata about the error:\n\n```\n{\n  message: \"Database `XXX` already exists in:\8629r.dbCreate(\"XXX\")\8629^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\",\n  msg: \"Database `XXX` already exists.\",\n  name: \"RqlRuntimeError\",\n  code: \"database exists\",\n  meta: {\n    database: 'XXX',\n    time: 12345,\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAgain, sorry if I missed something or if there's an existing open issue (I searched, but I didn't see anything quite like this).\n"
