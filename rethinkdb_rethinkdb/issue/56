        "Setup:\n1. Spin up a cluster with two machines.\n2. Run the stress client for a while to build up some data (I had 30k items).\n3. Shard the test.stress table into 4 shards\n\nReproduction:\n1. Start with one replica\n2. Set the number of replicas to 2\n3. Before backfilling completes, set the number of replicas back to 1\n4. Quickly set the number of replicas back to 2\n\nObserve:\nThe progress bar section goes away\nThe available replicas flickers between 0/4, 0/8, 4/4, and settles on 4/8, where it stays until backfill completes.\n\nIt would be expected that the progress bar section would stay open, and the number of replicas doesn't flicker.\n"
