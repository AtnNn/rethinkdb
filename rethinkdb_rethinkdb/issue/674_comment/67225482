      "There has been a little conversation in #3441, some if which implies that people only really want to see the latest results. I think that that might work for all cases if paired with a way of manually specifying a results directory to allow multiple data sets. In most of the cases I can come up with this is probably better behavior:\r\n\r\n* working on a test or problem and constantly running a test to check on progress (or pull out output)\r\n* doing full runs to validate (e.g.: you only want pass/fail)\r\n\r\nAnd other common use cases are easily done:\r\n\r\n* automated testing should be targeting a specific folder\r\n* \"before\" and \"after\" is easy to do by specifying those folders\r\n* multiple simultaneous runs (e.g. running on different settings simultaneously from the same folder)\r\n\r\nAnd for features of `test/run` like `-F`/`--only-failed` this would actually make it easier to implement.\r\n\r\nMy only worry about auto-cleaning is a nebulous one about deleting files from a folder that is not really an old results directory.\r\n"
