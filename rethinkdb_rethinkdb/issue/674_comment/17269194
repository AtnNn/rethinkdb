      "* I personally would still like it if `make` in the rql_test directory cleared out the run directory before putting new files in it.  I don't feel too strongly about this though.\r\n* I would really like to know what directory in `run` I need to look in for backtraces and stuff.  If the test driver could print out the name of the directory as it spins up the server that would basically fix the problem."
