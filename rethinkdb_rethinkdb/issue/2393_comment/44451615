      "I think the smartest approach is to have backfilling wait for secondary index post construction for now. That will be done in the sense of not processing any backfill chunks while any secondary index is being constructed on the table. Note that this way, we also consider user-initiated secondary index construction while backfills are in progress.\r\nThe advantage is that this is easy to implement and will immediately get rid of the most obvious problems.\r\nI think it will give a dramatic improvement in backfilling speed on rotational drives, though I still have to test that.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, we will implement #2134."
