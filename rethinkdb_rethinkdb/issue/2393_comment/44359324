      "> Maybe backfilling should wait until secondary indexes have finished constructing.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't seem like a bad idea, but it opens up a few other questions:\r\n\r\n- What happens if the user tries to post-construct multiple secondary indexes?\r\n- What happens if the user tries to do backfilling multiple times concurrently (for example, but adding a replica to a big table, waiting half an hour, then adding another big replica?) How would that work with our idea of backfilling in small chunks? (Ideally the second replica would start off where the first replica is at, and then backfill the beginning at the end?)"
