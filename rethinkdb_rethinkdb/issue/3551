This would indicate that the latter is being called with the wrong setting for `INTERPRETER_PATH` env variable.\r\n\r\nThus far I have been unable to get this to show up for any other test, or when I run just the one test. It only shows up when I run with about `-j 10`, and not always then. In those cases it is of the first round of tests, so there should not be leftover from another test."
