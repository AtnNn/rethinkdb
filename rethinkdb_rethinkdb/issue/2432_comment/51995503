      "I am seeing a lot more problems out of `test_utils.py` based tests, specifically they are unable to find open ports:\r\n```error: Could not bind to RDB protocol port: The address at localhost:58163 is reserved or already in use.```\r\nMy guess is that there are enough things spinning up at the same time that something is grabbing the port between when we fish for an open one and when the server process opens it. There are enough simultaneous processes now that this is a real possibility."
