      "In python 3.1/2.7 they changed the float -> string algorithm, which is used in the json module. The usual algorithm everyone uses is specified in IEEE-754, but the new one tries to find the shortest representation that still round trips (float -> string -> float) to the same value (e.g. it will output `\"1.1\"` instead of `\"1.1000000000000001\"`)\r\n\r\nhttp://bugs.python.org/issue3166\r\nhttp://bugs.python.org/issue1811\r\n\r\nSo, this may not be it, but it's suspicious that we serialize all our floats to strings in the protocol and then only python has the issue."
