I don't understand what you mean when you say \"but is tricky to get the right value to use without knowing the sorts of values you expect\"; I would basically want to see `float_a == float_b` replaced with `math.abs(float_a - float_b) < tolerance * float_a` for some tolerance (typical values are `0.0001` representing 0.01%)."
