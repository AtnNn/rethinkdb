      "@gchpaco: The case in point here highlights the problem of using a fixed percentage: .01% error on a GEO position can be over 2 miles (Earths circumference: 24,901 x .0001 = 2.4901). I would say that that is clearly not an acceptable error in this case.\r\n\r\nAnd a better formula for that generic strategy is: `abs(float_a - float_b) < tolerance * ((abs(float_a) + abs(float_b))/2)`. That takes care of cases like `float_a = 0`.\r\n\r\nBut I still think that significant (decimal) figures is the way to go here."
