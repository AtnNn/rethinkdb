      "It is within reason that a spherical reference system behaves slightly differently from an elliptical one (the default is WGS84, an ellipsoid).\r\nI don't understand all details of the algorithm we are using (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00190-012-0578-z), but usually these algorithms start with an initialization which is the spherical distance from point A to B, and then follow some iterative process to converge towards the distance on an ellipsoid. So if the reference system is actually spherical, no iteration is necessary and the code paths used might differ."
