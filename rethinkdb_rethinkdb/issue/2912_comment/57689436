      "The fix for this in Python and JavaScript is up for review in CR 2170, and adds a 'precision' `testopt` to the YAML options that sets a numeric limit to how different two numbers are allowed to be from each other. The option applies to all floating point comparisons in that one subtest. Not perfect, but it should be easy to separate testing into multiple subtests if something has some floats that need to be precise and others that can have some slop.\r\n\r\nThe Ruby changes are blocked by #3123"
