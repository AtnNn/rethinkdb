        "Our documentation for `without` indicates that this is possible:\n\n```\narray.without([selector1, selector2...]) \8594 array\n```\n\nHowever, attempting this results in the error:\n\n```\nRqlRuntimeError: Cannot perform without on a non-object non-sequence `1`. in:\nr.expr([1, 2, 3]).without(r.args([1, 3]))\n```\n\nWe could either update the documentation to reflect that this isn't possible or support array types with `without` on the server.  I think the latter is useful and should be implemented.\n"
