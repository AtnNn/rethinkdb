      "In a single-threaded application it's technically fine to use `.repl`.\r\n\r\n@chipotle any suggestions for how we could improve the warning in the documentation? I think the current version is pretty good, but it seems that it can make the impression that there were other technical issues with `.repl` apart from the one explicitly mentioned."
