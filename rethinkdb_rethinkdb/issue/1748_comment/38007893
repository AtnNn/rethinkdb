      "Regarding the CLANG vs. GCC discussion:\r\n\r\n@coffeemug:\r\n> Because it's a) the path of least resistance, b) almost certainly good enough, and c) requires zero effort on our part. We can do a lot of other work, and we'll have a 95% likelihood of discovering that we should have just used the latest version of gcc.\r\n\r\nI fail to see where there is any a) less resistance and c) less effort (certainly not zero effort) in using a fixed version of GCC vs. a fixed version of CLANG.\r\nProbably @atnnn is the best person to judge the effort involved. Would you say that one is probably easier to set up than the other?"
