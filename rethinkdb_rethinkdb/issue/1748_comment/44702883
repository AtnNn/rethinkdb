      "We can't use *reprepro*, it only allows a single version of each package. Launchpad had the same behaviour. It is one of the reasons I want to move away from launchpad because made downgrading almost impossible.\r\n\r\nI have tried almost every other tool listed here:\r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/HowToSetupADebianRepository\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, all of them are missing features that we would want."
