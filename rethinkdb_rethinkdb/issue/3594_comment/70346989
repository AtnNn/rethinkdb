      "> I don't think the second side-effect is a huge deal, the biggest problem would be if a user loses some server data directories, resulting in a table that can never be reconfigured\r\n\r\nActually, we're planning to provide an \"escape hatch\" in case this happens. The user can reconfigure the table in a \"hard override\" mode, which works as long as at least one replica is available, but which may result in limited data loss because the replica might not have the most up-to-date writes. So this probably isn't actually a problem."
