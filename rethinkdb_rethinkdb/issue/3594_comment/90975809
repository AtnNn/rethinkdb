      "I still maintain that we should never have a \"or might be unreachable\" error message. That is just going to cause \"RethinkDB lost my data\" panic. I don't think that we should ever lose track of the table list on any server (within what we can control). If you lose all of the shard-holders for a table, then there should be a way for an admin to force the deletion of the table to fix the solution, and @danielmewes's sounds fine to me.\r\n\r\nAs to @danielmewes's thought about checking for a table before using it: that seems like an odd worry to me. With two exceptions (testing like we do, and temporary tables), table creation is almost always done by either a setup script or an admin manually doing it. Anyone who is constantly checking for table existence before working with it is probably doing something wrong, and we can't control for stupid."
