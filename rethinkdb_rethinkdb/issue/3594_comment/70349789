      "@larkost: you adminned a very different group of computers than @coffeemug is talking about. Where the machines are mostly virtual, and having the cluster administration software spin up new ones if there's a hiccup is expected and normal. You'll want logs to see that something happened, but an individual virtual server being thrown out and a new one provisioned isn't always a big deal in cloud environments.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it doesn't sound like there's a one-size fits all answer. Both use cases seem realistic to me. Maybe if you're using heavy cloud automation for your cluster, you wouldn't mind changing a config to turn off server tracking. It seems like the common small cluster case is to care about your servers"
