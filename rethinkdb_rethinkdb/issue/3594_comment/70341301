      "> One major side effect is that under the new system, a server will not know that a table exists unless it can contact at least one of the servers hosting the table.\r\n\r\nI think this might be a problem. May be we could transmit an eventually consistent list of table names to every node in the cluster (possibly by duplicating it into the semilattices)? \r\n\r\n> Another side effect is that the table metadata cannot be changed unless a quorum of the servers hosting the table are available.\r\n\r\nThis is a reasonable tradeoff, I wouldn't worry about this side effect."
