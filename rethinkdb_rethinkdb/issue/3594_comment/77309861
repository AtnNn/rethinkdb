      "> have a \"cleanup\" command: `r.purge_table_list()`\r\n\r\nI would prefer not to do it if possible. This is leaking an implementation detail to the user. Same for the notion of removing a server from a cluster (it would be really nice to get away from that completely).\r\n\r\nI think expiring the non-authoritative list would be ideal. We could add a `force` optarg to `table_create` to deal with the instantaneous recreation case if we want to. In case the cluster is all connected, setting the optarg to `true` would create a duplicate table (this way it doesn't feel like too big an implementation leak/transgression)."
