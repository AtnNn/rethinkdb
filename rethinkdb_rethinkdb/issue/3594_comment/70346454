      "@coffeemug: My focus is mostly on the experience of the sys-admin and with that in mind the defects of the original proposal are:\r\n\r\n1. The admin getting an incorrect \"no such table\" when connecting to an net-isolated computer that was not a shareholder for that table. This would lead to admins incorrectly panicking that \"RethinkDB lost my data!\" rather than focusing on the actual problem (netsplit). Adding more verbiage about \"or could be not visible\" feels like low-qulity punting.\r\n\r\n2. The problem [nicely written up](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3594#issuecomment-70338179) by @Tryneus that would cause duplicate tables.\r\n\r\n3. If I were a sysadmin of a 100-computer RethinkDB cluster I would need to know when one of my machines was not connected to the cluster. Having RethinkDB notice this and present that information on the admin pages makes for a really nice system."
