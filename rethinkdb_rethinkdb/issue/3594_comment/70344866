      "> As part of the same discussion, we decided to do the same thing for servers. So we changed our minds about the principle that \"if you disconnect a server from the cluster, you shouldn't get an error message if it didn't have any responsibilities\".\r\n\r\nI think we should this discuss this a bit more. I could see arguments for this and against this, and it's not clear to me which is better. @VeXocide @larkost -- @timmaxw told me you have strong opinions on this -- would you mind sharing them here?"
