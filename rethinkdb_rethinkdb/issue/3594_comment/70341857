      "After a lot of in-person discussion, we decided on the following: Each server will store a non-authoritative list of all the tables it knows about. This list will be stored and transmitted in approximately the same way as the current semilattices.\r\n\r\nAs part of the same discussion, we decided to do the same thing for servers. So we changed our minds about the principle that \"if you disconnect a server from the cluster, you shouldn't get an error message if it didn't have any responsibilities\"."
