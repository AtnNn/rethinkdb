      "@coffeemug: Having admined a 300+ computer group (not quite a cluster, but close) I absolutely wanted something to tell me that a computer had dropped off the system. Note that this is separate from the computer being down, in many cases the computer was running, but not in communication with or not running my service.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that the system should stop working, or not self-heal. But I want:\r\n1. The list of all of the current problems.\r\n2. A simple panel that I can go to get status on all of my servers to reassure myself that all is green[1].\r\n3. The full log of when things went bad and when they got fixed (how is secondary)\r\n\r\nThe idea that servers could come and go from my cluster without me being aware of it scares me. Making it easy for me to both add and remove servers is definitely a plus, but doing so magically gives me the willies.\r\n\r\n[1] It is amazing how obsessed many managers get about having a dashboard with a bunch of green indicators. Us providing a one-stop location for both the \"good\" and \"bad\" items is a very attractive thing for admins."
