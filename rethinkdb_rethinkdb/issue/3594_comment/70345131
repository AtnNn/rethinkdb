      "@deontologician: I haven't thought through the details yet, but here's a preliminary answer: Raft is necessary for auto-failover because it gives stronger consistency guarantees than the semilattices. But it's not strictly necessary to store the table config in Raft; we could hypothetically keep the table config in the semilattices and just use Raft for auto-failover-related state. Also, the place where we'll be storing non-authoritative data might not act exactly like the semilattices."
