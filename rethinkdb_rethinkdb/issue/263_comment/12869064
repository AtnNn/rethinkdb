      "I think that 3 would take more work to implement, and it would officially sever us from JSON as our underlying data model (although we're planning to do that at some point anyway).  On the other hand, it's safer than 2 (if you try to do an operation that makes sense on strings but not dates, you'd get an error), and it's more flexible.  I would be happy with any of the 3 solutions."
