      "In that case you should probably convert to seconds since epoch. I think there's also a human readable representation of dates that orders correctly under string comparison but I'm blanking on what that is. I could dig it up for you. Also another good option would be to just store the seconds since epoch and human readable version as separate fields in the same document. Not ideal but it could make things nicer."
