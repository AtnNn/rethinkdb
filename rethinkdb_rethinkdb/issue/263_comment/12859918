      "I'd also point out that until we do, you can fall back on the somewhat annoying workaround of `r.js`. You can run arbitrary javascript code this way to do custom comparisons. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Assuming each row has a \"my_date\" attribute\r\n\r\nr.table('foo').filter(r.js(\"this.my_data.slice(0,10) === '2013-01-02'\"))\r\n.run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is very cumbersome and we're sorry, but as @jdoliner pointed out, we'll address this in a more comprehensive manner soon. I'm slating for 1.5, we'll try to get dates in by then."
