      "Ahh, I see. To deal with Month-Year problem, we'll allow arbitrary groupings, so you'll be able to say something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table('sales').groupBy([r.month('datefield'), r.year('datefield')], r.sum('amount'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will group by the array ['Feb', 2013], so that you can basically do whatever you want. We'll try to get this in as soon as we can!"
