      "We'll try to get dates in for 1.7. I think the overall proposal to store strings and adding date functions (e.g. `get_day`, `get_month`, etc.) is relatively easy to implement and has few architectural drawbacks, so I *hope* (fingers crossed) that we can get it through ReQL proposal review pretty quickly.\r\n\r\n(TL;DR: I'll see if we can get this done for 1.7)"
