      "I think some people may simply not want to let a table run away with all of there disk space they will be able to try to write to that table. and the reponse from the db will be out of disk space and then they may have  a command to gc old records they run that old records get removed and then they are able to try to write to the table. It would be really cool if you where able to submit both if the table is out of space try running this and see if it makes space then run again. one thing for this is think about someone that tries to make a cache for image files that they pull off the web and store in rethinkdb they dont want some of the images ot be so big and fill up there disk space."
