      "`getAll` always uses an index, so I don't think it's not using the index here. It's just that it doesn't seem to have any performance benefits to do so.\r\n\r\nCan you post the query that uses the primary index as well? In general primary indexes are a bit more efficient than secondary indexes in RethinkDB, but this is only by a constant factor. As the data size grows, both primary and secondary indexes scale equally well."
