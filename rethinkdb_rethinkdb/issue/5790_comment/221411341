      "`getAll` on a primary key is more efficient because it can route only to the shard that contains the requested key (because the shard boundaries are based on primary key ranges). secondary-index based `getAll` requests must route to all shards. Again, if the table becomes large, both have `O(log n)` performance. But the constant overhead is different."
