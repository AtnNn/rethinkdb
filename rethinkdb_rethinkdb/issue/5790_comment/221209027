      "Hi Daniel,\r\n\r\nthanks for the suggestion regarding eqJoin.\r\nIn this particular case I can use the primary index as well (as described in my initial post), which already gives a significant performance boost.\r\n\r\nMy concern however is the fact that a primary index gives a significant performance improvement, even on this very small collection, while a secondary index isn't used at all.\r\nIf I define a secondary index and explicitly call it in my query it should at least be used , no?\r\nAnd I would even expect at least a slight performance gain in comparison to not using any index at all, even on a small collection, cfr the use of a primary index."
