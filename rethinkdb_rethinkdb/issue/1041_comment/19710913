      "An instance of cJSON->datum_t conversion where I actually could confirm that it causes slow queries is #1042 .\r\nHowever the query tested there didn't actually suffer from the repeated conversion back into a cJSON object, which this issue is about. It could have been circumvented this issue because the expensive getAll() was followed up immediately by a filter which might have removed most of the documents."
