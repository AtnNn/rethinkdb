      "@srh @neumino: I still feel like the missing metablock stems from trying to load an older database with a newer version or vice versa. @neumino Are you sure you created the database with the same version as the one that you got the metablock_found crash with? You said that you moved to a different branch during the tests. Could it be that there still was an older binary around or something?"
