      "Just left a cluster of two machines running overnight, with a table set to 1 replica (primary).  When I got in today, I changed it to two replicas, and the node being backfilled to (new secondary) instantly crashed with this same backtrace (8 times, I assume once per hash shard).  Restarting the dead server results in the same crash.  I have not tried restarting the non-crashing server in case it is useful for debugging."
