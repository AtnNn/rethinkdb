      "Okay, the assertions are wrong, and the code around them is wrong.  Because naturally, when you have two shards on a tree, you've got two sources of timestamps, and up the spine of the shard boundary, the timestamp is going to be the maximum of the two timestamps, and that means we always need to update the timestamp with the max timestamp rather than the most recently introduced timestamp.  This also means, hey, get comfortable with using superceding_recency to update timestamps.  Such is their nature.\r\n"
