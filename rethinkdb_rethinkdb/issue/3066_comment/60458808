      "How about the following API. In `table_config`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    wait_on_disks: true,\r\n    shards: [\r\n        {\r\n            replicas: ..., primary_replica: ...,\r\n            acknowledgements: [{\r\n                mode: 'majority'\r\n                from_replicas: [...]\r\n            },\r\n            ...]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would let the user (a) set these per shard explicitly, and (b) set up different acknowledgement modes for different datacenters. It would essentially replicate the current functionality, except they'll have to say `majority/single` instead of provide a number. (Note, I think it should be `'single'`, not `'one'`, as `'one'` implies some sort of a number and opens up questions as to why I can't set an integer. I think `'single'` is a better name).\r\n\r\nI don't think we should add these options to `table_create` and `rebalance` -- not adding them is simpler, and the functionality is pretty advanced. If people want it, they can set it themselves in a document.\r\n\r\nBy default, `reconfigure` should set up majority acknowledgements for the primary replica tag, and single acknowledgment for all other replica tags. If the user doesn't specify the tags and just passes numbers, `reconfigure` should just set it as majority for all servers.\r\n\r\nWe should allow users to skip this entire attribute when they write to the config. If they do, the system will just set acknowledgements to majority for all servers. They should also be able to omit `from_replicas` field, in which case the system will set it for all replicas internally.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n"
