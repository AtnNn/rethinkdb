      "I think we should do option 2 or 4. In #2856 we briefly discussed Boolean operations on tags. The proposed format was string-based; your example would be `{\"us_east|us_west\": 3}`. But I don't think this is worth implementing at this time.\r\n\r\nEdit: I favor option 2, because I think we can get away with it, at least for now.\r\n\r\nEdit 2: Also, option 2 gives us an easy upgrade path. We add a new `write_acks` optarg, but it defaults to `\"majority\"`."
