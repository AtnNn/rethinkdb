      "> I see, that makes sense. In this case, let's always pick majority unless the user specifies the primary tag and specifies replica counts via tags?\r\n\r\nI personally would probably go for just always picking `majority` for all used servers. It's the least \"magic\" and very easy to understand and explain. It also doesn't make assumptions about how tags are used. The single majority per tag makes sense if the tags correspond to data centers. But what if they are for example different performance classes of machines (e.g. `ssd` and `hdd` or `much_ram` `little_ram`)? Then there is no reason to get one ack from each tag."
