      "That sounds reasonable. Note that under my proposal, we don't supply per-shard ack replica lists; instead we supply a list of ack replicas for all the shards together. So if the user specifies `\"majority\"` in the complicated syntax, I assume that we would take the intersection of the user-supplied list of ack replicas with each individual shard's list of replicas; count the size of the largest such intersection; calculate the smallest integer larger than half of that; and then require that many acks from the list on each shard. This is consistent with my proposed behavior for `\"majority\"`."
