      "I actually think that having the exact numbers of acks rather than `\"majority\"`/`\"single\"` next to the ack replica lists makes it a bit easier to understand.\r\nThe reason is what @timmaxw commented about: `\"majority\"` would not actually mean a majority of the servers in the list, but a majority of the smallest intersection with the different shards' replica lists. I think this is more confusing than specifying the absolute number."
