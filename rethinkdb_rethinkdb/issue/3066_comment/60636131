      "Your second example makes sense.\r\n\r\nWhat I still find confusing is your first example, where the replica tags are not explicitly specified:\r\n`t.reconfigure(shards=2, replicas=5, primary_tag='datacenter_a')`\r\n\r\nIf you set the `majority` only on the servers that are picked from `datacenter_a` and no acknowledgement for servers with other tags, your result will be completely arbitrary.\r\n`reconfigure` is free to pick anything from a single to all five servers from `datacenter_a`.\r\nYour result will be very different in case it only picks a single server from `datacenter_a` (you will overall only wait for 1 ack from the primary) vs. picking all servers from `datacenter_a` (you will wait for 3 acks, including the primary)."
