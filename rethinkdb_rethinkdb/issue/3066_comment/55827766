      "* When Raft is implemented, we'll only guarantee safety when `wait_on_replicas` is `majority` *and* `wait_on_disks` is `True`. I think that's OK as long as we document it.\r\n\r\n* `acknowledgement_replicas` seems like a slightly awkward name, partially because it's so long. `important_replicas`? `voting_replicas`?\r\n\r\n* `acknowledgement_replicas` is conceptually per-shard. How do we derive the per-shard list from this list? Is it the intersection of the shard's replica list and `acknowledgement_replicas`? If so, then we should require that every server in `acknowledgement_replicas` is a replica for at least one shard.\r\n\r\n* I think we should probably require at least two acknowledgement replicas per shard, because the safety guarantees are useless otherwise."
