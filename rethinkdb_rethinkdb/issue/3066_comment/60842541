      "I like this proposal a lot. A big problem with it is that you can't say \"I want majority acks from the primary datacenter and a single ack from my backup datacenters\" without passing this information to every query, and lots of people expressed a lot of interest in that kind of functionality (it's a pretty common setup). What if we did:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    wait_on_disks: true,\r\n    shards: [{\r\n        replicas: [\"us_east_1\", \"us_east_2\", \"us_east_3\", \"us_west\"],\r\n        primary_replica: \"us_east_1\",\r\n        write_ack_mode: \"majority\",   // or \"single\"\r\n        write_ack_replicas: [\"us_east_1\", \"us_east_2\", \"us_east_3\"]\r\n        }]\r\n}\r\n```"
