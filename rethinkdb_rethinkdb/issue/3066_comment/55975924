      "> When Raft is implemented, we'll only guarantee safety when `wait_on_replicas` is `majority` *and* `wait_on_disks` is `True`.\r\n\r\n:+1: \r\n\r\n> `acknowledgement_replicas` seems like a slightly awkward name, partially because it's so long. `important_replicas`? `voting_replicas`?\r\n\r\nYep, we'll have to pick a better name. I don't like the ones you're proposing, but I'll think of a better one.\r\n\r\n> `acknowledgement_replicas` is conceptually per-shard.\r\n\r\nAh, I totally missed that. Let me think about it, may be we should reflect that in the format.\r\n\r\n> I think we should probably require at least two acknowledgement replicas per shard, because the safety guarantees are useless otherwise.\r\n\r\n:+1: (unless they set `wait_on_replicas` to `'one'`)"
