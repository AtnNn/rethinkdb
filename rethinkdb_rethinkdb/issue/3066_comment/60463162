      "> By default, reconfigure should set up majority acknowledgements for the primary replica tag, and single acknowledgment for all other replica tags.\r\n\r\nI have a few questions about this\r\n* What does it mean to set up majority acknowledgements for the primary replica tag? `reconfigure` will pick one server out of the ones tagged with that tag and pick that as the `primary_replica` for the shard. Acknowledgement from that primary is implicit. I don't think there's a need to add an acknowledgement entry for the primary. Maybe we still want to do so for verbosity?\r\n* Generally we could also enforce that there always has to be an acknowledgement entry for the primary replica. However the mode of that would be meaningless.\r\n* By single acknowledgement for all other replica tags, do you mean one for each or a single one for the union of them? So the total number of acknowledgement would be equal to the cardinality of the set `replica_tags union {primary tag}`, in case you mean the former?"
