      "I think I'd still prefer `majority/single` for the advanced syntax. The problem with an integer count is that I don't really know what to set it to, whereas `majority/single` gives me two clear options and an easy way to pick. IMO the intersection thing is easier to explain/understand than guidelines on a specific integer count."
