      "I think we should go for option 2 for v1 because I think we can get away with it. Eventually, I think we should expand `reconfigure` to support option 4.\r\n\r\nMy only pet-peeve with @timmaxw's proposal is that there is an inconsistency with the simple and advanced syntaxes. With the simple syntax I can say \"majority\" or \"single\", but with the advanced syntax I have to provide a number. This is somewhat confusing, and I think we should consider two options to fix that:\r\n\r\n- Allow specifying an explicit count (an integer) in the simple mode. I.e. the user would be able to say \"I want 4 acks\".\r\n- In the advanced syntax, instead of the `count` field, have a `mode` field, and allow setting it to `majority` or `single`. I.e. the user would be able to say \"I want a majority from these four servers, and a single ack from these three servers.\"\r\n\r\nI like the latter option -- it's consistent with the simple syntax, and the question of \"how many do I set\" doesn't arise in the user's mind. It's always \"majority\" or \"single\". You can either do it for all replicas (the simple syntax), or you can go fine-grained and do it for a more refined set of sets. That makes a lot of sense to me, and I think is a fine balance."
