      "The memory leak happens consistently for me... received some error emails about not being able to connect to rtdb and noticed it using swap again today:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1200\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-29 at 7 51 17 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/522344/16457438/5dac9f56-3dd0-11e6-98ed-2ff589b49c59.png\">\r\n\r\n@danielcompton do you want ssh access to this server? It's only used for testing rethinkdb so I could anonymize the data but keep writing so you can see the memory leak happening. Not sure if that would help find the problematic code though."
