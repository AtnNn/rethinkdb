      "@bsharpe If memory is in use with the `rethinkdb` process gone, that suggests that there's something else going on on the system. I'm not sure if we can help with that.\r\nDo you know how the \"used\" RAM is measured? Maybe the number includes the kernel's buffer cache, in which case the memory would be expected to remain in use until it is needed elsewhere."
