      "@alanhamlett SSH access might be useful to check a few things. Please contact me via email to daniel@rethinkdb.com so I can send you an SSH key.\r\n\r\nWhen did you take that screenshot? Was that while the issue was happening or later? It looks like RethinkDB there is just using 10.5 GB of RAM, which is in the expected range for a server with 16 GB of total RAM. It's not clear to me from the screenshot what's using the swap memory in that moment."
