      "@erikdubbelboer noticed that this issue only appeared at a time where the storage system (disk I/o) was saturated.\r\n\r\n@cjhowe , @Omeryl , @alanhamlett do you think the same might be the case in your scenarios? Could RethinkDB be bound by either disk bandwidth or random seeks / IOPS limits? You can check `iostat -d 1 -m` (or similar) to find out about the current disk bandwidth and IOPS."
