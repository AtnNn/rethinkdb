      "That's all we can figure.  \r\nHowever, i've found that stopping the rethink process does not free up all the RAM, or the swap.  Once rethink has been stopped -- we can do `sudo swapoff -a && sudo swapon -a` frees up the swap instantly.   Doing that with rethink running makes rethink very slow to respond.\r\n\r\nThe allocated memory doesn't seem to belong to any process -- but i need to confirm that before it's considered fact.\r\n\r\nWe get a much longer time without swap if we do a full reboot of the system before bringing rethink back up.\r\n"
