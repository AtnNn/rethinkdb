      "Quick update: So far we haven't been able to reproduce this locally. We're still investigating.\r\n\r\nOne odd thing is that in some cases the issue seems to have appeared with RethinkDB 2.3.2 (which would make some sense, since we switched the memory allocator library in that version among some other things). But for others 2.3.2 is working fine and 2.3.3 seems to be the first version with issues (which has extremely few changes from 2.3.2, none of which seem related)."
