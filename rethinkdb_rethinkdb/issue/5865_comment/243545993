      "@bsharpe Do you have data available for how much of the RAM is actually used by the rethinkdb process when it starts going into swap? We've recently found that Linux in the default configuration often places parts of a RethinkDB process into swap, long before memory is actually getting exhausted. We have refined our swapping-detection as a reaction to this ( https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/6020 ), but the patch is only going to ship with RethinkDB 2.4.0 .\r\nA way to avoid swapping in these circumstances is to change the `swappiness` parameter. See the \"RethinkDB is running out of memory\" section in https://rethinkdb.com/docs/troubleshooting/ ."
