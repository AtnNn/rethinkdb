        "In the `raft` branch the `feed_union.rb` test is currently failing in an unhelpful way (basically: \"something is timing out waiting for `.next`, but I am not going to tell you where). After working on this for a while I am confused (as is @mlucy) about why it is succeeding in `next`, so feel the need to rewrite it. Having worked to fix the current incarnation for a while yesterday I think that is needs larger change and so am proposing a re-write into Python in order to use the `unitest` facilities that we have there.\r\n\r\nGoals of the re-write:\r\n* Be very explicit about what fails\r\n* The tests should be easy to understand\r\n* Break the tests into small units that tests specific aspects\r\n* Expected output should be readable and probably not automatically generated\r\n* Cover `stream`s and `changefeed`s with `limit`\r\n* Include one test with a lot of `union`'ed `changefeeds`"
