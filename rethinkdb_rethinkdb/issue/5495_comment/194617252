      "I'll have to look into this a bit more.\r\n\r\nRight now RethinkDB doesn't implement job queue primitives directly, though it can be used to obtain a similar functionality.\r\n\r\nSupporting something like this either natively or as an addon system could be very cool.\r\nIt's also interesting in the context of Horizon, a new software we're working on that works on top of RethinkDB and enables developing frontend applications without a need to write custom backend code (the high-level idea behind Horizon is described in this comment: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3711#issuecomment-151639571 )."
