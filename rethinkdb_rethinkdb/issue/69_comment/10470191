      "By the way, when I said \"per-process\" I meant \"per-call\", i.e. different map/reduce tasks having different limits, which is the part that strikes me as \"unclean\". Sanity checks on v8 processes would be nice, obviously.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Linux includes builtin support for setting process limits, I can give you some info about it if you need it."
