      "Ah, I see. Currently all v8 computation is already done in separate processes, so they can't really hurt rethinkdb server. We do have to write some code to kill/restart them when they get out of line, but that wouldn't be too difficult.\r\n\r\nWhat's the format/API for your users to write map/reduce code in? If they just provide a javascript map function and a javascript reduce function, as soon as this bug is closed you can just push them down to rethink and they won't be able to hurt the server. If you want them to provide full blown reql queries, that would be more difficult because we'd have to write an entire quota system, and that's a non-trivial amount of work."
