      "The application I'm making right now allows (untrusted) users to write their own analytics code, so it would be fantastic if I could just push it to RethinkDB to run. I'm currently using a custom Lua backend which I kill when it exceeds some limits.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I were designing a database, I wouldn't put that feature in, as there's no clean way to do it. Is there a way, at least, to do map/reduce with a custom process of my own (i.e. launch a separate process/script/program to be the mapper/reducer)?\r\n\r\nObviously, horizontal scaling is important to me here, rather than having to ferry all the data across the shards to process it.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Here's the app, for reference: http://www.instahero.com/"
