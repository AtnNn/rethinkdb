      "I don't think that that actually wouldn't be very hard to do at all. We'd simply add a \"timeout\" optional argument to the query language. Here's how it might look from the outside.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nr.js(\"while(true) { ; }\", timeout=5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm personally not familiar with how optional arguments are handled on the server beyond protobuf parsing but I assume it's pretty straight forward."
