      "It turns out that timeout based external job interruption has been lying dormant in the code the whole time. Turning it on is simply a matter of setting a non-zero timeout value. There are a few next steps here.\r\n\r\n* decide on the right timeout value\r\n* make sure that the interruptor code does the right thing. It appears to work but this dormant functionality has never been tested\r\n* change the error message generated when the JS query is interrupted"
