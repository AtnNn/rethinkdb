      "Here's how it works. All this code is in extproc/pool.cc if you want to check it out.\r\n\r\n1. a timer interruptor is created and set to go off after the configured timeout time is up\r\n1. the js job is serialized and assigned to an external worker in the pool\r\n1. a coroutine waits interruptibly with the timer interruptor for the external worker to respond\r\n1. if the timer interruptor goes off before the external process responds the worker is killed with a SIGKILL signal\r\n1. more workers are then spawned until the pool is full again"
