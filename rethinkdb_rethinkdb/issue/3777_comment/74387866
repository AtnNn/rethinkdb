      "I would personally expect `table.get.delete` to show up as one write.  (I'm not sure what I would expect for `table.get.replace(f, non_atomic: true)`, but one read and one write in that case sounds slightly better because it will emphasize the performance characteristics of non-atomic writes for people.)"
