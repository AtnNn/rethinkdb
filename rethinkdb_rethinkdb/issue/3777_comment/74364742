      "How do you think a delete should look if the row exists, e.g. `r.table('foo').get(100).delete()`?  One read and one write, or just one write?  The query contains a get, which I think means you expect it to register as a read.  However, the value is never read out of the btree, so maybe it shouldn't show as a read."
