      "IMO the `writes` and `reads` we report in the stats should correspond as closely as possible tot he number of `write` and `read` queries users issue.  Users probably have a pretty good mental model of that, whereas writing `r.table('test').update({a: 1})` and seeing your reads spike while your writes stay at 0 is just confusing.\r\n\r\nI think it's OK for some of the operations we report as writes to be cheaper than other operations we report as writes (the same is true for soft durability and hard durability writes, which are lumped together)."
