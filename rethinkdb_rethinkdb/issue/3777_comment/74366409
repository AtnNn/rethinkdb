      "Also, backfill is kind of confusing.  I had a table of 100 rows in one shard, and then resharded it across two servers, one of which was already hosting the primary.  I then see:\r\n* server 1\r\n  * 48 reads\r\n  * 48 writes\r\n* server 2\r\n  * 0 reads\r\n  * 48 writes\r\n\r\nThis is reasonable, server 1 transferred 48 rows to server 2, then removed them.  The behavior is much harder to understand when the table has three pre-existing secondary indexes:\r\n* server 1\r\n  * 48 reads\r\n  * 144 writes\r\n* server 2\r\n  * 48 reads\r\n  * 288 writes\r\n"
