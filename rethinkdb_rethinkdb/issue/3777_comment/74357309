      "I don't think a no-op write should count as a write, but it should count as a read - nothing is getting committed to the btree, but we do look at the row in the cache (and load it off disk, if necessary).  There seems to be a problem right now that `point_write_t` and `point_delete_t` operations are not counting the read in stats.  The read is still counted in range replaces.  Investigating."
