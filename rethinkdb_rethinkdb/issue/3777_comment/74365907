      "@danielmewes, we have some other glaring bugs in how many keys read/written we are reporting.  Here's what I've found from testing:\r\n\r\n* replaces that don't change the row aren't reporting writes (the purpose of this issue)\r\n* pretty much all writes are counting a write for each index affected\r\n* secondary index post-construction is counting 1 read and 2 writes for each row (should be 1 read, 1 write)\r\n* `table.get` for a row that doesn't exist still reports a read (this isn't as obviously wrong as the others)"
