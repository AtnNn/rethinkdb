      "I tried this on a table with 1M documents, in both release and debug mode, both on a single machine and when sharded across two machines.  I could not reproduce this behavior.  The query was properly interrupted when issuing the query through the Data Explorer and the python client.  Tried in `next` and `v1.13.x`.  In all cases, the read workload disappeared within about 1 second."
