      "@sibblegp -- ok, here's what we're going to do. We have two hypothesis as to what may be occurring, and we can't tell which one will fix the problem without the core dump. We'd like to fix one at a time to make sure we know exactly what's going on. We're going to blindly put the most likely fix for this problem into the next minor release (1.4.4) and ask you to retest. If it fixes the problem -- great. If not, we're going to put the other fix into 1.4.5 and ask you to retest. We're confident that one of these will fix your problem, but we can't be 100% sure without the core dump.\r\n\r\n@mlucy will be working to get this done. We should be able to get 1.4.4 with the first fix to you on Thursday. Sorry for the somewhat complicated process, but unfortunately without the core dump that's the best we can do."
