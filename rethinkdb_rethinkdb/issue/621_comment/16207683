      "@sibblegp -- It turns out that we don't have symbols for 1.4.2, and that it's difficult to regenerate them.  This means, unfortunately, that we can't make much sense out of this backtrace.  This was a pretty major screwup on our part, and we've fixed it for 1.4.3.\r\n\r\nWe released 1.4.3 today, which contains several bugfixes which might fix your issue.  If it persists in 1.4.3 and you can provide us with the 1.4.3 backtrace, we'd love to take a look at it!"
