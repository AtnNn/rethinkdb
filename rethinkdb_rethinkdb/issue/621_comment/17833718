      "Hey guys.  Sorry for disappearing.  Been traveling and everything has been wild!\r\n\r\nI hate to say it, but we migrated off of rethinkdb.  The performance just wasn't there for the use case we needed and the stability was causing issues.  I'll continue using it in my own projects when I can.  Take care!\r\n\r\n-George"
