      "Hi @sibblegp,\r\n\r\nSo, there are two things this could be: either we're serializing a `wire_datum_map_t` immediately after deserializing it, which the code doesn't account for, or we're forgetting to finalize it somewhere.  The first is easy to fix whereas the second would require some detective work.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we can't distinguish between the two of those solely based on the backtrace.  Would you be willing to provide us with a core dump?\r\n\r\nYou can do this by typing `ulimit -c unlimited`, which will enable core dumps, and then reproducing the issue.  (It will dump a core file into the current directory.)  After that @mglukhovsky will coordinate with you to get us a copy of the file (they can sometimes be quite large).\r\n\r\nIf you have proprietary data in RethinkDB when the error occurs, we'd be happy to sign an NDA for the core dump.\r\n"
