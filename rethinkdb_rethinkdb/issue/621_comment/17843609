      "George, this is totally understandable -- we're all sorry for disappointing you and are working very hard on making all these problems go away. I believe all known stability issues are fixed, but would you mind sharing a bit of info of what your workload looks like so that we can fix the performance issues? (you can shoot me an email to slava@rethinkdb.com if you can't talk about it in public)\r\n\r\nClosing this issue, as there is nothing left to be done here."
