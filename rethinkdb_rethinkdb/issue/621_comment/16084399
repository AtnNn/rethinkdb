      "Hi @sibblegp!\r\n\r\nThanks for the backtrace.  We've apparently had a minor mishap with our symbol files on launchpad (Issue #624), so it might be a day or two before I can turn this into a symbolic backtrace and look into it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, could you tell me:\r\n* Are you running on a 32-bit or 64-bit system?\r\n* Is there anything in particular that triggers the bug, or does it just happen randomly?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
