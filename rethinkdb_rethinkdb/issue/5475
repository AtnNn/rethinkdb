It would be great to have the ability to execute a write query that doesn't update any documents, but returns the same result as it would otherwise.\r\n\r\nI imagine this to be an option to each of the write commands, not unlike `reconfigure()`:\r\n```\r\nr.table(...).update(..., {returnChanges: true, dryRun: true})\r\n```"
