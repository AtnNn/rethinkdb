      "@danielmewes one option would be to create a new `http_response` pseudotype. The specifics of the API would need to be discussed, but it would give you guys a place to throw any of the HTTP request/response metadata (and not just headers). Since the drivers could just unwrap the psuedotype value (response body) when it gets deserialized, the server could return everything by default but not introduce a breaking change to user code. However, as you mentioned, things would still be tricky when the response is a stream."
