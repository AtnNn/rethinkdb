      "I am reluctant to pass `CXXFLAGS` for RethinkDB onto V8 because it might cause the V8 build to fail.\r\n\r\nHowever if you pass the flags in the `CXXFLAGS` environment variable, both RethinkDB and V8 should pick them up. Is that an acceptable solution for you?\r\n\r\nThe `improved_fetch` branch shares the parallelism when building V8. It is being tracked in #1231.\r\n"
