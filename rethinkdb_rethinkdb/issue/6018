And I have taken steps to prevent swap usage on my production server.\r\n\r\nHowever, on my development laptop this error is rather annoying and unnecessary since performance is not an issue.\r\n\r\nI think a command line flag or some way to dismiss the error would be nice. I would prefer that my attention is directed to the big red bar only when there is actually a problem."
