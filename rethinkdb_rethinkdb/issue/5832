        "Is it possible to build ejabberd like chat system with groups using Rethinkdb?\n\nQuestions: Protocol being used by RethinkDB clients? I read it's TCP. How different is that compared to popular MQTT protocol for low battery consumption in the mobile devices. Are there benchmarks available comparing MQTT battery usage compared to say Swift client battery usage?\n\nThe sequence of messages received in the group chat is critical. How accurately does RethinkDB handle that given the network QoS may differ for the different set of users?\n\nLatency comparison relative to ejabberd like systems?\n"
