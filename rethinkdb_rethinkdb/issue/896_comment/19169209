      "@neumino \r\n\r\nI followed your directions, but it failed to build Rethinkdb. Thinking it was a version problem with less, I ran the configure and make commands after uninstalling and re-installing LESS, but it didn't resolve the issue.\r\nConfigure: https://gist.github.com/dancole/5743902\r\nMake (less 1.4.0): https://gist.github.com/dancole/5744030\r\nMake (less 1.3.3): https://gist.github.com/dancole/5744100\r\nMake (less 1.3.0): https://gist.github.com/dancole/5744177\r\n"
