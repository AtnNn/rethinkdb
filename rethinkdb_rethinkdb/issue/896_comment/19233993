Our next release will include these changes.\r\n\r\nIf configure complains that tcmalloc_minimal (static) is not found, you can use `--static none` to use the dynamic version.\r\n\r\nIf it complains that less is too recent, use `--fetch less`.\r\n\r\nPlease reopen the issue if it doesn't work for you."
