      "The implementation is done, but the user interface is not well-defined; pinging @coffeemug and @timmaxw to discuss.\r\n\r\nCurrent plan at the moment is to replace `use_outdated` with `read_mode`, with the possible values:\r\n * `committed` - perform the read on the primary, but only return once the data has been committed to disk on a majority of replicas\r\n * `primary` - perform the read on the primary, but do not wait for the data to be committed to disk\r\n * `secondary` - allow reads from secondary replicas, and do not wait for the data to be committed to disk\r\n\r\nObviously these names are up for debate.  Since `use_outdated` is an optarg on `r.table`, I imagine this will be as well."
