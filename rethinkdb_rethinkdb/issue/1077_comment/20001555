      "A few releases ago rethinkdb would silently ignore any unknown options in the config file, which was a bad idea. You could say `listen=any` or `port-ofset=10` and rethinkdb did not complain.\r\n\r\nNow rethinkdb accepts too few options, we should solve that by white-listing all possible options for all commands."
