(I'm also using the latest version of RethinkDB : 2.3.5).\r\n\r\nWith the default configuration, opening the console in Firefox gives this: no connection (whereas the connection is active with the Node.js client, for instance). At the hint of a Stackoverflow user, I tried in Chrome and it works.\r\n\r\n![rethinkdb-admin](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2790608/18543174/cc13e9cc-7b2e-11e6-8e16-f359313c69f7.png)"
