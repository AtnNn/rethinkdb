      "Dropping the acceptance of `r.db` terms entirely would simplify things on the server side since the `global_optargs_t` could be represented as a map of datums, instead of a map of `wire_func_t`'s or a map of `counted_t<val_t>`'s, and since we can then just allow only \"deterministic\" expressions (since `r.db(...)` isn't deterministic)."
