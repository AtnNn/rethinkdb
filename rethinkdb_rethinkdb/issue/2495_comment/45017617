      "Also, this may not be behavior we still want, but currently you can override any local optarg with a global optarg.  E.g. instead of `r.http(..., paginate: P).run(conn)` you could write `r.http(...).run(conn, paginate: P)` and it would work.  (This is useful if e.g. you're doing a lot of JS calls in your query and you want to specify a timeout in only one place, or in the common case where you want to specify a db for all your table queries.)"
