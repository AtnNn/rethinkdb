      "1. __The arrows for nested objects have strange indentation which makes results confusing to read.__\r\nFixed in e2c78f8a5c2851069e4f2835e415b7ff6f30e241\r\n\r\n\r\n2. __Column size is usually very compact and often cuts off text which can be rather frustrating. We should try to have a smarter algorithm for column size__\r\nThe max default size is 310 pixels now (= size of an uuid). Commit 0dd3b09115ffa7c07da1f8beb7f15ef3e45fb389\r\nIn case there is some space left (table with 2 columns for example), we are going to increase the size of each columns until \r\n  - There is no more space (ie if we make it bigger, an horizontal scrollbar will appear at the bottom)\r\n  - All document fit in one line\r\nCommit 97c5e0894e534f93f0477e286c4918823b94515b , \r\n\r\n\r\n3. __There is a lot of unnecessarily wasted space between the query and the results which can be easily removed without any downside.__\r\nThe two sections have been merged in c32f9cef66abe1ff352fea2bd64678f383649d26\r\n\r\n\r\n4. __If we readjust the width of the columns in the table view and reexecute the query, the adjustments aren't remembered.__\r\nIf we readjust the width of the columns in the table view and reexecute the query, the adjustments aren't remembered.\r\nSo now the data explorer remembers the size of the columns that were manually re-sized.\r\nIf the keys are not the same, we reinitialize the size of all columns.\r\nCommit: 34db08aed54cfdb8f466d4a115ad73e54cf3ca79\r\n\r\n\r\nCode review: 132\r\n\r\n\r\n"
