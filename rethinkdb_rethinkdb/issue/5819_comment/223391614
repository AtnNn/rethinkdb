      "Thanks for the bug report @lomithrani.\r\n\r\nCould you send us the full `log_file`s from all servers in the cluster? You can email them to me directly via daniel@rethinkdb.com .\r\n\r\nWe think that something goes wrong when reading the dates from the logs, though the dates in the part that you posted here look fine.\r\n\r\nAnother question: Which time zone do you have your Windows server configured in?"
