      "Awesome @marshall007 !\r\n\r\n> @mlucy there were no existing tests that returned an RqlOpIndeterminateError. I'm not sure if that's an oversight on my part or if there simply aren't any existing cases that cover that.\r\n\r\nThat's correct, `OpIndeterminate` is only produced by events that cause internal disconnects in the cluster which the polyglot tests aren't set up to produce right now.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAssigning to @deontologician since he seems best able to review it (if that's alright?)."
