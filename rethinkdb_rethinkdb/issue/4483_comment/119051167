      "The only thing that hasn't been addressed here is the failing connections tests (quoting myself):\r\n\r\n> Also there are a few failing connections tests in the JS driver right now. Two of them are timeouts, and the others are \"could not connect to server\" errors for `r.http`. So there may be a couple tests in there that still need to be updated, but I was unsure of why they were failing to begin with.\r\n\r\nPart of that is probably #4496, but also some tests in `connections/http.js` weren't updated because I couldn't get them to run. I think it has something to do with httpbin being proxied and that wasn't working for me."
