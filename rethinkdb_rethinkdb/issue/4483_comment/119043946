      "Thinking about this again, I think we should merge this regardless of #4484 so we can include it in the 2.1 beta. If the tests need to be adapted, we can do that after #4484 gets in. (@deontologician)\r\n\r\nDo the test changes currently in this pull request assume the current behavior or the one with #4484 fixed?"
