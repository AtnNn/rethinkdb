        "TLDR: how do I explicitly delete a nested field in an object?\r\n\r\nI have a users table, the row for that has a nested field 'channels' which may or may not have a nested field where each field is a channel name and the value is a permissions object\r\n\r\nthe idea is that I have a  set of resources which are channels to pubnub streams  for a company that I may assign to users and I'm building a company class with methods to manage the streams, I also need to then remove the channel from the user\r\n\r\nto make this more explicit, here's an example\r\n``` javascript\r\n{\r\n  'channels': {\r\n       'uuid-2975696087656': {\r\n         publish: 0,\r\n         subscribe: 1\r\n       }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow I want to be able to remove a channel from this company, currently I have some code based on has_fields. the idea is that I user hasFields to get all users that have this field in channels.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar query = {};\r\nquery.channels = {};\r\nquery[channelName]: true;\r\n\r\nr.table('users').has_fields(query)\r\n.map(function(users) {\r\n  //?? how do I remove that field\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nhow do I remove that field in the map?\r\n"
