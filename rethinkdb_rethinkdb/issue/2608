        "TLDR: how do I explicitly delete a nested field in an object?\n\nI have a users table, the row for that has a nested field 'channels' which may or may not have a nested field where each field is a channel name and the value is a permissions object\n\nthe idea is that I have a  set of resources which are channels to pubnub streams  for a company that I may assign to users and I'm building a company class with methods to manage the streams, I also need to then remove the channel from the user\n\nto make this more explicit, here's an example\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  'channels': {\n       'uuid-2975696087656': {\n         publish: 0,\n         subscribe: 1\n       }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nnow I want to be able to remove a channel from this company, currently I have some code based on has_fields. the idea is that I user hasFields to get all users that have this field in channels.\n\n```\nvar query = {};\nquery.channels = {};\nquery[channelName]: true;\n\nr.table('users').has_fields(query)\n.map(function(users) {\n  //?? how do I remove that field\n})\n\n```\n\nhow do I remove that field in the map?\n"
