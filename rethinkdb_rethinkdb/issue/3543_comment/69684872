      "This would have been relevant for 1.16 for the reason that shipping a new term (`table.wait()`) and then completely changing what it returns in the next release is a little odd.\r\n\r\nHowever I agree that it's not sufficiently clear what the best choice is here, so we're not going to change the result format for 1.16."
