      "In practice waiting in parallel and waiting in sequence are almost exactly equivalent. The only difference is that `r.db(...).wait()` will wait until all the tables are available simultaneously. For example, suppose that tables A and B are unavailable, then A becomes available, then A becomes unavailable, then B becomes available. If you run `r.db(...).wait()`, it won't return. But if you run `r.expr([\"A\", \"B\"]).foreach(r.table(r.row).wait())`, it will return. But that distinction isn't important enough to worry about, I think."
