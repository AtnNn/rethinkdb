      "I'm thinking the most common use of `.wait()` will be to use the table in some way immediately afterward. If there's a setup script or something that just wants to wait on a bunch of things and doesn't need to do anything, maybe its ok to have to tack on a dummy query in that case.\r\n\r\nThat's a good point though that I hadn't thought of. I guess the question is what's better in most cases."
