      "I like this idea.  I think we should make `wait` return the thing waited on, and make it variadic to support the waiting on multiple tables use case (having to use foreach for that is ugly anyway).  This leaves the question of what `r.wait(r.table('test'), r.table('test2'))` should return -- it clearly can't return both tables.  Any opinions on that?\r\n\r\nI don't have an opinion on whether or not to support `r.db(...).wait()`, but if we do support it I think it should wait on all the tables in the database.\r\n\r\n@deontologician -- is there any particularly compelling reason to try and squeeze this into 1.16?"
