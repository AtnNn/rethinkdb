      "Do we really want `r.table('test').wait().run()` to start a cursor scan of the entire table?  The user would have to explicitly close the cursor if they don't want it, or tack some dummy query onto the end to avoid that situation.\r\n\r\nWe could add a different internal type that `wait` returns that doesn't default to a table scan, but I'm not sure it's worth it, it seems too inconsistent."
