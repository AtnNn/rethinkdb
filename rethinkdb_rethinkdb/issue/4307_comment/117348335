      "@danielmewes \r\n\r\nI think there are a couple of things needed for a quality integration with Meteor's optimistic UI system (or for that matter, any correct ad-hoc system implementing the same feature):\r\n\r\n- Either version numbers or some-kind of unique identifiers for the changes.\r\n- Make it possible to figure out when a write to DB appears in the change-feeds:\r\n  * One of the ways to achieve this: make unique identifiers for the changes ordered, also make every query to return the identifier for the write, so the clients can look for it (or any changes after it, in case of `squash: 1`) in the change-feeds"
