      "Thanks for the report @cefn, and sorry for the confusion. You are completely right of course, and the example should use `gt`. Unfortunately it's hard to detect such mistakes in the JavaScript driver (it's not really an issue of `filter`, but of how anonymous functions are processed within the driver).\r\n\r\nI opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/1090 on the issue tracker for our documentation. We'll follow up over there."
