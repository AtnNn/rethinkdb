      "OK, I think I've figured out that r.expr() actually is never intended to handle an expression (as I understood from its name), but always performs the role of my suggested r.const(), so forget about that bit. \r\n\r\nHowever, as per the last post I am still struggling to find examples where locally-evaluated primitives should be passed in to filter() without an r.expr() wrap, and I personally would prefer a name like r.const() or r.value() since expr suggests expression evaluation (which is not intended, since in fact a locally evaluated javascript value is always expected to be passed)."
