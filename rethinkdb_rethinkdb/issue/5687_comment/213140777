      "@cefn I was thinking of code like this, which I have seen many times: (pseudo code)\r\n```\r\n// user input: conditions: {field1: value1, field2: value2:, ...}\r\nfilter = r.expr(true);\r\nfor each (field, value) in conditions:\r\n  filter = filter.and(r.row(field).eq(value));\r\nresult = r.table(\"t\").filter(filter).run(conn);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will perform a constant filter whenever `conditions` is empty. Requiring users to special-case this makes such code harder to write, and easier to break if they forget to test or think about the empty case."
