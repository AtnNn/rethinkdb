      "A script for building an AMI is in the `atnnn/ami` branch (cc34922). I built the ami `ami-69cdbd00` with it.\r\n\r\nIt is missing two features that any user with a lot of data will need:\r\n\r\n1. Easy clustering. To join a cluster, you currently need to ssh into the instance, edit the configuration file and restart the rethinkdb service. To launch a whole cluster of instances, the process needs to be repeated for each instance.\r\n\r\n2. Easily put the data directory on a secondary EBS volume. Instances launched from this AMI come with only 5 or 6 gigs of free space that is not easy to expand.\r\n\r\nTo get faster IO, IOPS can be enabled and multiple volumes can be mounted together using RAID 0."
