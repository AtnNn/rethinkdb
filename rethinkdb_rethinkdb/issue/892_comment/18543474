      "Here's roughly what I think we need to get this out the door:\r\n\r\n* An amazon AMI instance available on the amazon marketplace\r\n  * We should prep the marketplace application early if possible, since it takes some time to get that processed\r\n  * We'll discuss pricing separately, but it'll either be free or very cheap (< $10/mo). One option is to charge for the AMI on the marketplace, but publish the full AMI separately to allow users to make a choice.\r\n* The AMI should come with a proxy that puts http authentication on top of the web UI (I believe @mlucy already built this part)\r\n  * We'll need to write instructions on how to change the password, hopefully in a one-liner\r\n* We'll need some form of client authentication (currently discussed in #266) and relevant support in client drivers\r\n* Instructions on how to run the node, access it, etc.\r\n\r\nWe'll keep updating this list as new issues come up during the implementation phase.\r\n\r\n@atnnn -- this is in your court. Please let me know about anything you need coordination-wise to get this done."
