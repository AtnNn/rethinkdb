      "I think another addition that would really make this a lot nicer is if you could specify a cluster to join via the web ui. I.e click a little button that says (\"Join Cluster\") which would prompt you for a hostname port pair and perhaps a password to integrate the node in to another cluster. We could probably get by without this to start."
