      "We already return a summary object from `rdb_replace_and_return_superblock`, which contains things like `:replaced => 1`.  That function has two variables `new_val` and `old_val` which contain the data we want.  If the optarg is set, we simply include `:vals => [{:old => old_val, :new => new_val}]` in the summary object.  The algorithm we use to combine summary objects concatenates arrays, so we'll end up with an array of all the replaced vals."
