      "I don't really know how hard it is to do an atomic get/set for a range of documents, but I also tend to think that offering this feature for point updates is enough.\r\n\r\nThe main use case is when an user update its own settings. I can't really think of a frequent use case where someone would have to do a range update and retrieve all the updated results.\r\n\r\nAlso, if I'm not mistaken, mongo's findAndModify doesn't exists for range updates."
