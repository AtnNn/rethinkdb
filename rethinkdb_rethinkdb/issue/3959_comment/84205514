      "Thanks for the prompt response, @mlucy \r\nThat makes sense and I sort of expected that to be happening since it goes away if I return the map directly. \r\n\r\nBut what kind of query statements should I be making if I want to translate [{\"a\":1},{\"a\":2}] to {\"a\":[1,2]} on the fly? Would r.js() be a better choice for me then?"
