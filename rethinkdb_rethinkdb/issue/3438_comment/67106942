      "@neumino Yeah, I think if the user data comes in as JSON in the first place, this is always safe in JavaScript.\r\nThe concern was about potentially existing other languages where distinguishing between bare user data and a ReQL term object might be more difficult.\r\n\r\nIn JavaScript and probably other languages, the user could probably fake ReQL pseudo-types, which might theoretically be a problem (e.g. say a user injects an `r.literal` into a query, and it overwrites data. Or maybe they insert an illegal pseudo-type and make a query that's supposed to insert a log entry about illegal access into a log table fail). This is again a separate thing though."
