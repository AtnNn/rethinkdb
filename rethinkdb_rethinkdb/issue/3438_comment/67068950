      "@kofalt thank you by the way for bringing this up. I opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3439 specifically for the `r.const()` proposal. Please feel free to chime in there.\r\nI believe something like `r.const()` in combination with appropriate documentation (https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/117) would solve the issue?"
