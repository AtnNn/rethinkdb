      "Baring `r.js` that is a special case, how would someone inject commands in a query? `r.json` is safe too since it's a server term.\r\n\r\nSuppose that I have\r\n```\r\ndata = ... // untrusted JSON.\r\nr.table(\"users\").get(1).update({email: data.email})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `data` is some JSON data, I don't see how someone can do something else than updating the email. They could update the email with an object, array or anything like that is not a string, but that's all.\r\n\r\nThe `VAR` terms, `IMPLICIT_VAR` cannot be created by the driver from straight JSON if I'm not mistaken. An array will be converted to `[2, [...]`.\r\n\r\nOr am I missing something?"
