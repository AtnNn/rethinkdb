      "Correction to my previous post: It seems that we use a separate term type for `r.literal`, so it might be that we actually check for it on the server to make sure that it cannot be injected through a plain JSON object.\r\nGetting it into a query would still make the query fail, but on the other hand that can also happen by simply injecting a null character into a string, or by making the value too large for the query-size limit. So if failing a query poses a security issue in an application, that probably requires more sophisticated checking on the application side anyway."
