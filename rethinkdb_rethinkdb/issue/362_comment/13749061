      "    r.default(r.table('tv_shows').filter({:name => char['show']}.nth(0), {})\r\n\r\nEh this seems harder to read to me. I don't like having the `default` so far away from the actual default value.\r\n\r\n    r.table('tv_shows').filter({:name => char['show']}.nth(0).default({})\r\n\r\nSo this is an ever so slightly different set of semantics because it will default to an empty dict if shows is empty or if `char` has no attribute `'show'`. I think this is useful but there should also be a way to soak up just on failed access without soaking them all up."
