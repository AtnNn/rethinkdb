      "I think doing this implicitly has a possibility of causing confusion because we have functions which are overloaded on objects and streams, map is a good example of this. Suppose I call `map` on a stream with a single object it's unclear if I should expect my function to be applied once to the object as a whole or once to each key value pair of the object. I also think that between this sugar and the overloading sugar the overloading is probably going to be more widely used although I think that we're basically all guessing 99% of the time we make a claim like that.\r\n\r\nI also think that for this particular problem being able to specify a default is a pretty intuitive solution. Then I could write:\r\n\r\nAborting writing this example because it's the same as @neumino's"
