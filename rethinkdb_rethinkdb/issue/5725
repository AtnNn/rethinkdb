        "Many languages have some kind of a symbol datatype that is distinct from a string. It would be great if this was supported in RethinkDB. Now that symbols are in ES6, would it be possible to extend RethinkDB's data model to support them? The counterargument to my proposal is that RethinkDB is a JSON document database, not a JS document database. Nevertheless, I think a symbol datatype would be very useful for data modelling."
