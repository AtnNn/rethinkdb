      "Hey @nodesocket, I'm running a similar setup to yours, except that my instances are 4-cores. My queries are huuuuuge(complex segmentation joining at least four tables with quantity and size of documents similar to yours) and the performance has been acceptable. I'm using some unoptimized things, like ungroup(), distinct() and group() without index, lots of chained filters, etc"
