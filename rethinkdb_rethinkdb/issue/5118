        "There is no way of specifying that `test-runner` use the system driver at the present. You can give ENV variables to direct specific versions to be used, but there is no way of using the system-installed version. I think that this is going to be important for PR #4783, and so have added this to the system.\r\n\r\nI have a branch already to do this, so this is more of a record-keeping bug.\r\n\r\nI should also note that I am changing the current pair of ENV variables for each driver (e.g.: `PYTHON_DRIVER_DIR` and `PYTHON_DRIVER_SRC_DIR`) to a single variable, e.g.: `PYTHON_DRIVER`. This will semi-intelligently take a built directory, .egg file, or source directory. A bit of `grep`ing leads me to believe that there is nothing that has been using this at present."
