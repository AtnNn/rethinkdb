      "You can close the thread, it was coming from the kubernetes network stack. I was actually having packet loss when communicating between two docker containers, I think I misread the results of the previous ping, because now I cant get past 5 minutes without 10-15% packet loss. \r\nRethinkDB is not the problem here for sure, sorry about the inconvenience and the time. I worked with the kubernetes team and they managed to get rid of the problem, as soon as I can test I think everything will be fine."
