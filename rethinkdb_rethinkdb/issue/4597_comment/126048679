      "I dont think it is ram related for me, even on a new cluster with nothing running and 8 or 16 go of rams i am having the problems. I dont need to run queries, i launched the nodes and even with no traffic I see the heartbeat timeouts. \n\nThere is no swap enabled on the host, and I dont think there is swap inside the container as well.\n\nAny other ideas ?\n\n\n--\n\nCordialement,\n\nAdam Guldemann\n\n> On 29 juil. 2015, at 22:06, Daniel Mewes <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> Hi @mcadam, sorry you're running into issues.

Assuming that the servers (either inside the container or on the host) are configured with swap enabled, could you check the output of free -m to see if any swap space has been used? For testing, it might be helpful to disable swap on the host and in the containers, so that running out of memory will cause the process to be terminated rather than becoming overly slow.\n> \n> I don't suspect the docker version to be the problem here.\n> \n> \8212\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n> \n"
