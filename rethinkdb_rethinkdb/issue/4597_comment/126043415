      "Hi @mcadam, sorry you're running into issues. Does this happen even on an idle cluster, or only if you run certain queries?\r\n\r\nIn many cases where we have seen heartbeat timeouts, those were caused by one of the servers running out of RAM and going into swap. Assuming that the servers (either inside the container or on the host) are configured with swap enabled, could you check the output of `free -m` to see if any swap space has been used? For testing, it might be helpful to disable swap on the host and in the containers, so that running out of memory will cause the process to be terminated rather than becoming overly slow.\r\n\r\nI don't suspect the docker version to be the problem here."
