      "It's not broken the way I thought, I'm just reading it wrong.\r\n\r\nHowever, it has the weird behaviour of testing that `nap(1)` sleeps for 1\177\&2ms but for `nap(40)` it expects approximately 40\177\&10ms.\r\n\r\nIn @anatol's failure, `nap(1)` sleeps for 2.06ms and in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3610#issuecomment-70606716, there seems to always be a difference of less than 4ms."
