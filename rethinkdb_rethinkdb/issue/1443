      Just
        "'make' ends at [315/318], but the build was successful.\nThe problem was that 'mkdir -p' sometimes creates multiple targets at once, that makes the difference of item counts between dry run and actual build. (such as MKDIR build/blah/, then MKDIR build/, the latter is ignored in actual building)\nAlternative solution to this could be making mkdir parent directory a dependency, but it looks pretty painful to me.\n"
