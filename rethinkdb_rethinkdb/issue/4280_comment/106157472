      "Composable cursors would be pretty neat and I can see where that would be useful. That being said you can compose multiple queries (including changefeeds, I think) using `r.union()` which also produces a lazy stream. I agree that the EventEmitter API is a pain to work with. I typically end up using `cursor.each(...)` and `cursor.next(...)` whenever possible, though that API definitely has room for improvement/simplification as well."
