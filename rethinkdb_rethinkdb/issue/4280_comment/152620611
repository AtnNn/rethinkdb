      "Looping back to add some new thoughts. Hands down the library to leverage in the JS Driver if any would be [`most`](https://github.com/cujojs/most/blob/master/docs/api.md). I say \"any\" because ES7 may have have [Observerables](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-observable) in which case the specified API may be enough leaving. @neumino I also now [disagree](http://cycle.js.org/) that FRP is \"fringe\" or ignored within the JS community. I think it has a relatively permeant future actually.\r\n\r\n\8211\8211Edit\r\n\r\nOne more thing I would like to add is that I have yet to really leverage RDB to such an extend that I even lean on the EE interface. I could very well see this issue being closed as its specific to the JS Driver. Its also trivial to plug the EE interface to `most` using [`most.fromEvent`](https://github.com/cujojs/most/blob/master/docs/api.md#mostfromevent)."
