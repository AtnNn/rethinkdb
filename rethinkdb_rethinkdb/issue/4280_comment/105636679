      "@deontologician Thanks for the links to current discussion on the topic. Maybe it would be better to do this in `rethinkdbdash` first which appears to be less beholden than the official library.\r\n\r\n@neumino Would you be interested in discussing this for `rethinkdbdash`? I can open an issue there if you are interested. "
