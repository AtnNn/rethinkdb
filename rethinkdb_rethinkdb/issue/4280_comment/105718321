      "FRP has been around for a few years now. I remember when bacon was actually created, but FRP never really took off, or at least I've seen very few libraries using the FRP paradigm.\r\n\r\nThe main trend is to just do everything by block (people actually don't want stream, they want the whole results). However, you can't always get everything (like when you have a changefeed), in which case the trend seems to be streams not FRP.\r\nI guess people also go with streams since they can just pipe to their tcp sockets, meaning that FRP is more something on the front-end side, not back-end.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'm happy to talk more about it for `rethinkdbdash`. I don't think it should remove the current implementation, but like we have `cursor: <bool>`, we could have `frp: <bool>`. \r\nI believe there shouldn't be any technical difficulties in providing this interface but:\r\n- I'm a bit worried that people won't know if they are running `map` in the database or on their client\r\n- I would need to read a bit more about `kefir` (it wasn't there a few years ago) and see how closing a feed would work (and how errors would be handled)"
