        "When `export` or `dump` run they can overwhelm some clusters, slowing down normal traffic. An ultimate solution would be to de-prioritize traffic going to the backup tools, but that would be a lot of work.\r\n\r\nA much more approachable solution would be to put rate limiting into the `export` command (which is used by `dump`). This would be per-concurrent table, and would have to be something simplistic like number-of-records-per-second, but would probably be the biggest bang-for-the-buck. "
