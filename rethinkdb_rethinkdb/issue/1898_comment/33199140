      "It's possible that the cause is related to my home directory's SSD running out of space -- as a result, I went into the ccache directory and deleted its tmp directory.  Though I think that happened after I saw this problem recently.  That would match #1405's theory that this somehow has to do with ccache.  Or it might be a somewhat different usage pattern I've exhibited lately.  Even if it is, it's a pretty annoying problem, at least it's a constant slow drip on productivity over the rest of human civilization if it's not fixed, wherever it is."
