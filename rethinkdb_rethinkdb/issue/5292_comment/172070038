      "Something else we might need to be careful about: The way I read `readResponse`, it only returns once it has received a response the the given token.\r\nSay *cursor A*'s `CONTINUE` request calls `readResponse` first, followed by *cursor B*.\r\nAssume that the server first replies to *cursor B*'s request though. The `readResponse` call of *cursor A* is going to get that response and call `extend()` on *cursor B*. Later it will receive the response for *cursor A* that it was waiting for and return.\r\nHowever *cursor B* is still stuck in the `readResponse` call. It will never return, since *cursor A*'s call to `readResponse` had already consumed the response for *cursor B* from the connection.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked where exactly `readResponse` is called, and this might not actually be an issue."
