      "First of all, a big shout at @bchavez for his amazing mentoring on this issue. While the current state of this PR is not as everyone wished for - it doesn't work! -, I wouldn't have gotten this far without his guidance. Thank you!\r\n\r\nNow, I have screwed up with `Cursor` and it seems I'm hitting a wall here. I really need your help!\r\n\r\nI understand if you guys don't like my latest commit since it breaks with the previous design but I couldn't maintain the old design with all the behavior changes going on. I've tried to my best effort to mimic the .NET driver, though. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to get this working.\r\n\r\nI am more than happy to give contributor access to my branch to anyone trying to help, but I have no problems with someone opening a working PR that satisfies everybody and see this closed. I need this feature.\r\n\r\n**Failing tests**:\r\n```\r\ncom.rethinkdb.gen.ChangefeedsIncludeStates > test FAILED\r\n    java.lang.AssertionError at ChangefeedsIncludeStates.java:114\r\n\r\ncom.rethinkdb.gen.ChangefeedsTable > test FAILED\r\n    org.junit.runners.model.TestTimedOutException at ChangefeedsTable.java:86\r\n\r\ncom.rethinkdb.RethinkDBTest > testConcurrentCursor FAILED\r\n    org.junit.runners.model.TestTimedOutException at RethinkDBTest.java:394\r\n```"
