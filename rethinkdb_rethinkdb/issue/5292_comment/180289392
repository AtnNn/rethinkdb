      "@bchavez it makes sense and is definitely something we should do. I just wanted to prove the behavior works before working the final PR.\r\n\r\nRe: rename `SocketWrapper`, again I agree but I know naming is a hard thing to do, and we need input from @deontologician or @danielmewes on this.\r\n\r\nRight now, I need to catch up some late work but will come back to this ASAP."
