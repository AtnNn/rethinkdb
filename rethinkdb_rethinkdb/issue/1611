        "Now that the query profiler is in next, we should integrate text-only support for it in the data explorer (i.e. showing the json document, not the visualization). There is some debate as to how to do it (@jdoliner and @mglukhovsky proposed running all queries with profiling turned on and showing the results in a tab; I think it would be better to have a separate function for profiling).\n\nI'm going to run some performance tests to see how much overhead the profiler requires and will report back.\n\nMoving to subsequent. It would be nice to get it in for 1.11, but we won't hold the release for it.\n"
