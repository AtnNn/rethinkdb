      Just
        "Currently if you start a server with the `--join` option and there is no server running at the given location then the server hangs with the last two lines being:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninfo: Listening for intracluster connections on port 29015\r\ninfo: Attempting connection to 1 peer...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this behavior is not bad, I think it would be improved by eventually timing out. My reasoning is that if you are using a launch service (e.g.: systemd, launchd) then the users might be tricked into thinking that everything is going well when in fact your server is effectively hung.\r\n\r\nOf course there needs to be a balance since, as @timmaxw pointed out, we also don't want to cause problems for people who may have a cluster of computers all pointing at each other and if we set the timeout too low they may all self-terminate before the next machine can come on-line.\r\n\r\nI think a timeout (and failure exit) somewhere around 5-10 minutes would be good, with periodic warnings that no joinable servers have been found to the log/stderr would be a good solution. A command-line switch for this is probably overkill."
