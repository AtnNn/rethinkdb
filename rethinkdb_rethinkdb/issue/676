        "For this sprint, I'd like to go through the following process to get started with improving the API docs. Go through every command and categorize it by:\r\n\r\n* Likelihood of first encounter from early adopters (e.g. everyone encounters `run` very quickly, `coerce_to` a lot later)\r\n* Likely frequency of usage (people will use `filter` much more often than `branch`)\r\n* Clarity of documentation (our docs for `connect` are better than docs for `table_create`)\r\n\r\nI'll then try to maximize bang for buck by picking a small fraction of commands that will bring the most benefit when we add better focs. For each command in this list I'll do the following:\r\n\r\n* Specify what's unclear\r\n* Specify what info is missing and how it should be improved\r\n* Open a github issue to improve the docs for that specific command\r\n\r\nI'll also try define a more precise structure for each command (e.g. a description of each attribute, a description of return type, algorithmic complexity, links to SO questions about the command, etc.) so it can be specified, parsed, and displayed.\r\n\r\nI'll then post this information here, and schedule these issues (for this sprint if I can and beyond) so we can start gradually improving the quality of the API page docs."
