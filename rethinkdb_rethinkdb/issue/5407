But the one thing that i\8217m missing is  < insight / metrics / debugging > on what is happening behind the scenes.\r\nSome sort of log file where rethink would push out everything regarding http requests would be great.\r\nmeaning - failures, successes, timing and so on\8230 Perhaps you could even see it realtime in the dashboard with a some sort of simple *dev tools* like console. Would be happy to help were I can."
