      "I did a quick performance comparison on ext4 between `ftruncate` and `posix_fallocate`. I used a rotational disk, and performed 5000 point inserts with hard durability on a fresh table in series.\r\n\r\nWith `ftruncate`, I'm getting an average of 47 inserts/s. With `posix_fallocate`, I'm getting an average of 51 inserts/s.\r\n\r\nThat's not a big difference, but it seems to be consistent.\r\n\r\nI haven't implemented reducing the file size for the `posix_fallocate` in this test. I'm not sure if that would be relevant in this simple test."
