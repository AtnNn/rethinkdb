      "People definitely often take advantage of ability to quickly get a few documents when they don't care about ordering. For example \"give me the first document you can find\" and \"give me the first ten documents you can find\" are very common queries.\r\n\r\nI think it would be sensible to have `slice` and `indexesOf` only work on ordered sequences. I suspect 99.99999% of the time they're only used on arrays anyway."
