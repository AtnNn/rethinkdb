      "Two things are weird about this:\r\n- The guarauntee seems to be outdated and wrong, now that we have variable block sizes back. But why is it not triggered by any unit test?\r\n- In this specific case, it was triggered when reading an internal or leaf node. Not a blob data node. I don't think we use less than max sized internal/leaf nodes, do we? Then why does the guarantee fail?\r\n\r\n@srh: Any ideas about this?"
