      "Here's an interesting coincidence: The documents I have in the table are a bit over 640 bytes long in JSON encoding. If we assume for a second that the code mistakenly gets a large blob block instead of a btree block, then that would probably mean that something is wrong with the snapshotting. That would suggest that this is the same bug as the remaining part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2073 .\r\n\r\nOf course the guarantee itself is still wrong."
