        "It would be nice if there were a `tables` property on all documents in the `jobs` table. For `query` jobs, this would include any tables referenced by the query (for queries that don't reference any tables like `r.expr(1)`, `tables` would be an empty array). This would also replace the existing `info.table` property for `index_construction` and `backfill` jobs.\n\nThe idea here is to be able to consistently filter documents in `jobs` by table (regardless of the job type).\n"
