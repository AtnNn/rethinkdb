      "After looking at this again I think that the simpler thing to do to fix this test is to not have it spin up its own server but rather use the server that `test-runner` is already offering. For all but one subtest this should work great. The two downsides:\r\n\r\n1. If a subtest were to mess up the server it will not re-launch for other subtests. Since we don't report on sub-tests this is probably ok (and highlights the overloaded nature of the connection tests).\r\n2. There is one subtest that needs to kill the server to check that we subsequently get the proper \"connection closed\" error. This subtest will not survive this change.\r\n\r\nI talked with @danielmewes, and we are both ok with these downsides, so I am going to make this change. I will keep the more expansive changes above in mind for later if we need them."
