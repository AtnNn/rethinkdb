      "@larkost Your idea seems good. The only issue I can think of that you haven't mentioned is making sure that instances get killed when the tests are over.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I took a quick look at the tests in connection.js. It seems to me that, with minor tweaks, they could all be run against the same server. The server could be spawned and its address passed on the command line like for the polyglot tests."
