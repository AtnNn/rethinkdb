      "The script that this would call (called object) would inherit the ENV variables from the caller, and would notice the same ones that `connections/connection.js` would have interpreted to get the connection information from the server from the pool maintained by the test harness. But absent these ENV variables it could still spin up its own.\r\n\r\nOh, and `test/common/driver.py` already has `atexit` handlers that take care of cleanup."
