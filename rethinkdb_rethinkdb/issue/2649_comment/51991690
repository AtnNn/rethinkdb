      "That is actually what I want to do here in practice, but also allow them to be run independently without the test harness. The `RETHINKDB_TEST_SERVER_DATA_DIR` and neighbors would allow this to be seamless to the tests: the called object in question would inherit those and do the right thing. They would call the same thing and use what they got back without having to know if this was a pooled server or not."
