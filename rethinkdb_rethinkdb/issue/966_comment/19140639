      "Ccing Etienne -- He is the one building the formula for homebrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Bryan: The quickest fix for now would be to replace the file template.js\r\nwith the one attached.\r\nThe file template.js should be in /usr/local/share/rethinkdb/web\r\n\r\n\r\nI just talked to Etienne. This should be fixed in the branch next and\r\nshould be released something like Tuesday next week.\r\nWe are still going to double check before releasing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know if that works for you,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\n\r\n2013/6/7 Bryan Helmig <notifications@github.com>\r\n\r\n> Thanks for the fast response Michel!
