        "Having a bunch of files separate from the main binary is a real drag. I have to remember to copy a whole folder whenever I move the rethinkdb binary or run it from a different location or I have to figure out where the folder is installed and pass it as an option to rethinkdb on startup.\r\n\r\nWe should compile the web assets into the rethinkdb binary and have the web server point serve from there. This would be much more convenient than having a separate directory."
