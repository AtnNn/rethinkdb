      "There are some bad bugs in `alpha-4`. IIRC, this was fixed recently, see #5386 for details.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the C# driver is using [`alpha-6`](https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver/blob/master/Builder/build.fsx#L7) for testing (see [`build.fsx`](https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver/blob/master/Builder/build.fsx#L7)).\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet serverDownload = \r\n\"http://circus.atnnn.com/ipfs/QmZkxXdHE9sRhNQ91Fh418wN927GdJ2QBVnQeZLDV3LX5j/rethinkdb-windows-alpha-6.zip\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `alpha-6` should solve this issue and survive the full test battery. However, some tests will fail, namely:\r\n\r\n* `DataumNumber`. Currently tracking #5349 for a fix.\r\n* `MetaTable`. Should be fixed next time I re-generate the unit tests later next week.\r\n\r\nLet us know if this helps.\r\n-Brian"
