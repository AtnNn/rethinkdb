      "I appreciate that it's an alpha build and I'm expecting bugs. I really want RethinkDB to work well on Windows and that's why I'm bashing on it. I assume the point of an alpha release is for people to find the bugs and report them, no?\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm closing this issue as Brian already mentioned that the issue is fixed in a subsequent build."
