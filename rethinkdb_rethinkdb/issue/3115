        "I discussed this in person with @timmaxw and @Tryneus -- this would be a spectacular addition to the reql admin release, and would take care of a number of related issues:\n- long running query log (and ability to kill)\n- much needed visibility into internal system processes\n\nI propose to create a system table `jobs`, and include any tasks that might make significant impact on the performance of the system. Off the top of my head:\n- user queries\n- any time GC spins up\n- secondary index post-construction\n- replication\n\nThe user ought to be able to delete documents from the table to kill jobs (we may not let them delete everything; but certainly user queries and index post-construction).\n\nI'm purposely omitting the structure of the document from the spec. I think the implementer should take a pass at it first and let us play with a prototype. Once we do, we can tune the API to make it more user-friendly (like we did with other parts of the reql admin).\n"
