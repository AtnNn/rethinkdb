      "@mindjuice I think @neumino is probably right that it got killed because it ran out of memory. Each table has a couple MB memory overhead even if it's completely empty. We also load some index structures off disk on startup for each table, which might explain the CPU usage on startup. It should eventually level off though.\r\n\r\n@mindjuice: The next time you see this, I recommend running `dmesg`. If RethinkDB got killed by the kernel's out of memory handler, there will be a message in there about that."
