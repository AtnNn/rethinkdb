      "@neumino That would make sense.  Is there some way to automatically cleanup those tables?  Perhaps the end of the test could just drop all the tables it created?\r\n\r\nIn any case, this still leaves some questions in my mind:\r\n\r\n1. Why is Rethink taking so much CPU when there are no queries being run against it?  Is this some sort of startup table validation?  Will the CPU usage drop down after a while?\r\n\r\n2. Why is Rethink crashing (or being killed)?  Nothing that Thinky does should be able to crash Rethink.\r\n\r\nThanks."
