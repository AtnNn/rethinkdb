      "Hi @mindjuice,\r\nfrom the looks of it, I would guess that something is creating a large number of tables.\r\nAre you calling `tableCreate` anywhere in your application?\r\n\r\nSince you've switched to the new data folder, are those files accumulating again?\r\nIf yes, could you post the output of `r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_status')` please?"
