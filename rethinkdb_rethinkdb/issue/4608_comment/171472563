      "That's an interesting note about 3 rather than 2 as a default for table replication (where there are at least 3 nodes available, of course). Here's another experience that was had during the outage of one shared host: Several deployments that had 3 nodes only replicated a table across 2 of them. As a result, the table wasn't writable. Data was safe, but it took some manual intervention to resolve. Again, I think the ultimate solution is for folks to simply be more familiar with their data, database engine, and infrastructure as a whole, but... alas. :smile:"
