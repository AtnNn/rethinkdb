      "I would like to see this with a default of min(3,servers) so it could handle automatic failover by default.\r\n\r\nMaybe a separate issue, but also worth considering is if shards should default to min(32,servers).\r\n\r\nThe possibility to also store more complex clusterwide defaults to tablecreate options in a system table I think would also be good.  I would be much happier storing a default for instance of\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{ shards: 12, \r\nreplicas: { us1: 3, us2: 3, eu1: 3 }, \r\nprimary_replica_tag: 'us1' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompared to having to solely rely on operational process around table and database creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
