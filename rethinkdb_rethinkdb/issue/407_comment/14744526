      "I found a way to reproduce this, I'll have a fix soon. make tries to include a `.d` which includes a bad generated rule to rebuild itself from the `.cc` file. In this case there is a valid rule to rebuild the `.cc` file from `ql2.proto`. This causes make to run the recipe even if `--dry-run` is specified, which breaks the count."
