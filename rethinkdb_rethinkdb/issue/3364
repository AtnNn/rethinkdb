        "We used to have two tokens for each read/write to establish ordering guarantees: One for updating the main btree, and a second one for updating secondary indexes.\nThese two tokens were coupled in a `write_token_pair_t` or `read_token_pair`. You would create them by calling `new_write_token_pair()` and the variable that it got stored in was often called `token_pair`.\n\nSince the alt cache was introduced, we had no need for the secondary index token anymore, and the `write_token_pair_t`/`read_token_pair_t` has really only contained a single token since then.\n\n@srh has renamed the `write_token_pair_t` to `write_token_t` and `read_token_pair_t` to `read_token_t` (to be merged soon).\n\nWe still need to rename the `new_write_token_pair()`/`new_read_token_pair()` functions and the `token_pair` (and similar) variable names.\n"
