      "I think it's a very good idea to give people multiple ways to handle missing attributes. The proposed syntax for default here is definitely a useful one we should implement because it lets you soak up a chain of possible missing attributes which is nice. However we don't want to force people to soak up all the missing attributes just to soak up one so we should also have a syntax like:\r\n\r\n    row('field', default)\r\n\r\nFor when you want to handle one specific missing attribute but still get back an error if the other ones are missing.\r\n\r\nBill's proposal includes what I think are some possibly confusing semantics in that it implies (if I understand correctly) that `Nothing[\"foo\"] = Nothing` which I'm not so sure I like. In coffeescript this throws an error and you need to use a special operator to do attribute in a way the propagates Nothings. I'm wondering if we can come up with a similar thing."
