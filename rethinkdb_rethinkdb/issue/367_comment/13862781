      "My understanding so far is that (in a next version):\r\n\r\n1. we will not error on a missing attribute (`obj(\"counts\")(\"key\")` would work even if `count` or `key` are missing)\r\n2. `default` as a function would become the value of a complete expression ( `obj(\"counts\")(\"key\").default(0)` returns 0 if either `counts` or `key` are missing)\r\n3. `obj(\"counts\", {})(\"key\", 0)` would allow to specify default values at different levels of an expression\r\n\r\n   (I think we can agree that writing `obj(\"counts\").default({})(\"key\").default(0)` would be terrible)\r\n\r\nAs a side note to @mlucy next to last comment: imagine doing that for 3 levels deep. IMO it would be ugly as :imp: \r\n"
