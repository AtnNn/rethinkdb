      "What's confusing to me is that `error` is now a special type of value that you can't pass in to functions. Basically we've moved to exception semantics (sort of). Which doesn't fit very well with our otherwise very functional language, at least I don't think it does. I think errors should be values just like other values in the language. The only difference is that some built in functions such as `filter` now to look for them a treat them as equivalent to `false`."
