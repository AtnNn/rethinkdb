      "Same thing happens on SSD or rotational. It's actually slower on my MBA (ssd) than Ubuntu (rotational, but in a raid)\r\n\r\nOn my MBA, rethink sits at 200mb. When I run a query like this\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.db('savr').table('log_populate')\r\n  .orderBy( r.desc('timestamp') )\r\n  .limit(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt climbs to 800mb ram, is paging, and CPU is running 100%. I just tried letting it run forever and it eventually responded with `RqlRuntimeError: Query interrupted.  Did you shut down the server? `\r\n\r\nThat same query responds in 2 seconds using `{ index : r.desc('timestamp') }` Same story when using getAll. If I use the index, it's the wrong result but it's fast. If I don't, it just hangs.\r\n"
