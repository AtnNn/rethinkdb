      "@mlucy, @jdoliner, a couple of questions:\r\n\r\n1. What are the technical reasons that force us to forbid `order_by` after `get_all`? It seems that it would always be equivalent to a `between`, and since we can do `.between.order_by`, what prevents us from doing `.get_all.order_by`?\r\n2. This issue is slated for 1.9.x. Is there a reason for that (as opposed to slating it for 1.9) if it's making it out for 1.9?\r\n3. As far turning things into an array will #971 and co help with this problem (by giving an error early, rather than timing out the query)?"
