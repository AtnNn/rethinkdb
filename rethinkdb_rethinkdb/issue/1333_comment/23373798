      "Ok, moving to 1.9 since it'll go into that release. FYI, here's how the system works for anyone reading it:\r\n\r\n* __backlog__: stuff we won't get to for a while\r\n* __subsequent__: stuff we won't get to in the coming release, but will get to in the near future (basically, high priority issues from backlog)\r\n* __1.9, 1.9.1, 1.9.2, etc.__: specific releases. If we're about to release a version and the feature will go into it, put it there.\r\n* __1.9.x, 1.10.x, etc.__: stuff we plan to release in a point release, but don't have a specific point milestone for it yet\r\n* __1.9, 1.10, etc.__: stuff that will go into a major release\r\n\r\nIt's very clear in my mind, but I can see how it can get confusing once I typed it out :) If something isn't clear -- ask me!"
