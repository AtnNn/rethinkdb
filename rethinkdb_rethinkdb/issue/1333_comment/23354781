      "Also @mlucy I'd like to point out that the suggestion of using a `between` isn't actually that helpful here because you can't do a `between` on one index and `order_by` on another. What you need to do in this case is create a new compound index using\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ntable.index_create(\"id_tstamp\", lambda x: [x[\"user_id\"], x[\"timestamp\"]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuerying this index is going to be tough but doable because of #955.
