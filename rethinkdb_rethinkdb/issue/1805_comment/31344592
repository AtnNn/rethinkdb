      "@baruch -- thanks for feature request! I'd like to understand the use case a little better. Do you want to mark connections as read-only as a precaution from running potentially erroneous code, or as a precaution from potentially malicious users?\r\n\r\nIf it's the latter, then I think what we really want here is a real permissions system (on the radar, but won't be scheduled for some time). If it's the former, a flag to the connection would be one possible solution, but I think this case would also be covered by a permissions system.\r\n\r\nWe could implement a flag in the interim, but since it's really hacky (and we'd likely have to maintain it), I'd *really* prefer to wait until we can put a full-blown permissions system in instead.\r\n\r\n"
