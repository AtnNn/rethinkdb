      "@jampekka This isn't yet possible unfortunately. Mounting on a read-only file system will make the server just not start up.\r\n\r\nThe best way to implement a read-only server at the moment would be routing all queries through a custom \"proxy\", that destructs the query, checks which terms are used in it, and then only passes it on to the actual server if the occurring terms are save (i.e. none of `r.http`, `delete`, `insert`, `update`, `replace`, `dbDrop`, `dbCreate`, `tableDrop`, `tableCreate`, `indexDrop`, `indexCreate`). This is definitely a bit of work though.\r\n\r\nMay I ask what your usage scenario looks like?"
