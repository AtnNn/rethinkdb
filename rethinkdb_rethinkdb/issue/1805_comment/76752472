      "Does the current RethinkDB support read-only replicas and could this be used as a securish workaround for having a read-only \"connection\" to a database with no secret data?\r\n\r\nThis would be crucial to my use case right now where having a private server with write access and a public read-only replica of it to which the changes would be consolidated. I could even live with manual hacks, eg putting the other replica's data files on read-only filesystem and having some downtime while manually consolidating the stuff."
