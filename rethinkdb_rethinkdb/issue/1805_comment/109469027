      "I'd also appreciate something similar to this. I'd like to be able to issue an auth key for every user programmatically accessing the DB \8211 this includes other clusters. Each key would be have an access level read, write, or both.\r\n\r\nOne immediate use for this is we have a staging db that we want to give many people access to, but we'd like to only give them read access, and we'd like to ensure we can revoke keys (e.g. if an employee leaves, or a key gets leaked)."
