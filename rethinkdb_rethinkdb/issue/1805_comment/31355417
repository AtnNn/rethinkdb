      "I wouldn't deploy something like rethink-miner openly for all so I don't expect anyone malicious to touch it. I'm mostly interested in something to ensure that no mistake in copy-paste or the like will result in any loss of data which may go undetected.\r\n\r\nIt does mean I would need a connection that is read-only and another that is read-write for the application purposes itself such as editing its own tables.\r\n\r\nAs for scheduling. that is obviously left up to you. It isn't a critical feature but it would give a good feeling and make me sleep better if I know that no one could edit the database through the interface that I give them.\r\n\r\nI could also implement some sort of firewall of my own on the rethinkdb query logic, either by changing the methods or by parsing the query in advance and filtering. It's just something that if it can happen in the database sounds like a better solution."
