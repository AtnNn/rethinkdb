      "I am with @danielmewes about `README.md`: you do not need to `make` the whole project in order to build the driver (`configure` is a different story). I just tested that to make sure.\r\n\r\nHowever, you do need to have a RethinkDB server executable to do any testing, and we default to using the latest built version. However, setting a `RDB_EXE_PATH` environmental variable should make the testing system use an existing install, but I have not audited everything to make sure that there are not holdouts that would ignore that."
