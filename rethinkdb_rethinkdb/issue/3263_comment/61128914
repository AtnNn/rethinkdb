      "That's the same issue indeed @AtnNn; I created this ticket as a reminder to do something about it.\r\n\r\nI disagree that this is a situation where the module dependency relationship should have to change, or that the order in which modules are installed should be important. I consider this a bug in the driver, which probably shouldn't make such a hard check but rather do something else. What, I'd have to look into further."
