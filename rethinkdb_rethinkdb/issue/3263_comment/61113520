      "If you load the same driver, it should work fine. Node doesn't reload twice the same file and therefore should not create two `Connection` functions.\r\n\r\nDo you load two different drivers? Typically do you have a `rethinkdb` package in your `~$HOME/node_modules`, and one in `<pathToA.js>/node_modules`\r\nOr do you load the driver with explicit paths (that happens to be different)?"
