      "Is it an `npm` thing that it installs two different copies of the driver? Or is this because of some special setup (@mstade)?\r\n\r\nAssuming that we add the driver version to the drivers, could we change the check such that it checks the version to be equal, rather than the import path?\r\nOr is there a deeper problem here with how node.js works?"
