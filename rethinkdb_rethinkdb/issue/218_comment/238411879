      "@GeoffreyPlitt Yes, it's there! User accounts and permissions for tables has been added to 2.3 along with a new authentication protocol, see #4519 and #5406 for more information. Support for permissions on system tables is currently in code review and will be added to 2.4, see #5692. Adding security features to an existing product is always a rather intrusive process thus we're taking this one step at a time, but this should cover most uses."
