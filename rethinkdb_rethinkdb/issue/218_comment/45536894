      "This would be super-useful for us. In particular (and in order of utility), per user:\r\n* authorization to connect to to specific databases\r\n* enabling/disabling database creation/deletion\r\n* forcing read-only connections (e.g. for reporting)\r\n\r\nUser accounts would be extremely valuable for us even without levels of permission granularity anything like Postgres.\r\n\r\nQuotas sound trickier, although a query timeout specified per-user would certainly be useful."
