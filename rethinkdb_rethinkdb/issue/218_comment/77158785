      "In the current architecture this could probably be worked around by setting other replica for access, which could use OS level limits, if there would be option for per-replica key views.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the longer term I'd wager that refactoring the architecture to allow multiple processes would pay off in the long run. It could allow also using RethinkDB as an process-embedded \"serverless\" database. But this probably should have an another ticket for better discussion."
