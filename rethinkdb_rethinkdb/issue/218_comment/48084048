      "Isn't authentication (and authorization) easiest to handle at the application layer?\r\n\r\nMy hunch is that most people run db nodes on locked-down internal networks, where the application servers [db drivers] are trusted and could perform authentication. I'd vote for allocating time elsewhere!"
