      "I think backwards compatibility is important enough to be on the list.\r\n\r\nUpgrading rethinkdb should not involve a dump and restore process. It could instead:\r\n\r\n- Not lose information such as secondary indexes, cache sizes and sharding and replication settings.\r\n- Be resilient to changes in ReQL\r\n- Not require having both the old and new version of rethinkdb installed\r\n- Possibly be reversible. If users find a regression, they may need to downgrade"
