      "@coffeemug Could you elaborate on how it has become less actionable? As a user, I've found watching this ticket to be a good way to review various 'gotchas' for myself & others who ask about the readiness of RethinkDB. It's convenient to see a high-level listing of what the developers consider outstanding issues.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see this either maintained/updated, or replaced with some other sort of roadmap."
