      "@kofalt -- sorry, I didn't realize people rely on this issue. I'll reopen it and keep it updated.\r\n\r\nIt's less relevant now because we're at a point where we can use a greedy approach internally -- we pick the most important things to work on at any given time and fix them. There is clear momentum towards production-readiness, and when we feel confident that most critical things have been worked out, we'll mark the product as production ready.\r\n\r\nI realize this is inconvenient, so I'll keep this issue updated with the current best guess as to what's left to do."
