      "I took the freedom to tick the following items off the list:\r\n> Work out high bandwidth issues with the WebUI\r\n> Clean up and document the stats subsystem\r\n> Clean up known hanging/crashing bugs\r\n\r\nThe first two are going to ship with 1.16, the last one is one where we now are sufficiently close to not keep it as a separate item on the list anymore.\r\n\r\nGenerally this list doesn't quite reflect the current roadmap anymore, but as discussed earlier keeping it open so we can send out a notification once we're there."
