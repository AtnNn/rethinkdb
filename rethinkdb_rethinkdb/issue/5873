        "In Chrome on Windows, if I type enough in the data explorer that the line wraps, the visual location of the cursor becomes disconnected from where the cursor actually is.  In my case the actual location of the cursor was two characters earlier, so if I position the cursor at the end of the word `fold` and type `.`, the buffer contains`fo.ld`.\n\nHere's the exact snippet that was triggering it for me:\n\n```\nr.expr([1, 5, 8, 10]).union([2, 7, 8], [2, 2, 9], {interleave: function(x) { return x; }}).map(function(x) { return {id: x}).fold(nil, function(acc, obj) { return obj('id'); }, emit: function(acc, obj\n```\n\nThis is actually _extremely_ annoying because it makes the data explorer very difficult to use for large queries.  (If I hard-wrap the line the problem goes away, but that isn't always easy to do.)\n"
