      "This could be an issue. From the code:\r\n```\r\n/* Note that we may begin an election even if we are not a voter in our own latest\r\n    configuration. This is necessary to prevent deadlock in some configuration change\r\n    scenarios. This corner case is explicitly addressed in the Raft dissertation, section\r\n    4.2.2: \"A server that is not part of its own latest configuration should still start\r\n    new elections, as it might still be needed until the C_new entry is committed.\" */\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's not do this for now."
