      "Hey guys, I'd like to clarify the state of affairs here. @migrap -- you originally reported two problems (a crash during rebalancing, and a follow up crash doing a count query). Of these two, which ones can you reproduce? (I understand you can't reproduce the rebalancing crash, but what about the follow up count query crash?) Do you still have the original data files post-crash?\r\n\r\nIf you have the original data files and the count query still crashes, we'd love to have those files so we can debug further. Otherwise, unfortunately we'll have to close this issue since there is nothing for us to go on :( (Of course if you run into it again, we'd be all over this to fix the bug if it's still there)"
