      "Hi @migrap -- I think there are two separate issues here.\r\n\r\n* The initial crash you get during the rebalancing. \r\n* The crash you get when you restart and run the `count` query. \r\n\r\nFor the backtrace that you posted, is that from the former or the latter crash? (we need both backtraces to work this out)\r\n\r\nThanks so much for reporting this. These issues can be *very* tricky and it might take a little bit of time to work this out. We'll work very hard to make sure we get you a solution ASAP."
