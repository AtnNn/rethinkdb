      "@migrap -- since you can't reproduce the rebalancing crash and the backtrace is truncated, would it be possible for you to share the data file with us so we can reproduce the query crashing in our local environment? This would help immensely -- we could sign an NDA if you'd like us too.\r\n\r\nIf you'd be willing to share the dataset, could you email mike@rethinkdb.com, and he'd help set up the transfer?"
