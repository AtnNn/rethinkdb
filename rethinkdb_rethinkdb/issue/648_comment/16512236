      "Since the crash isn't occurring on the latest build (1.4.3) I wanted to go back to 1.4.2 (1.4.2-1ubuntu1~quantal) and see if I could reproduce the crash on that version - since that's the version it originally crashed on. I don't see that package available via apt-get right now. How can I install that version?"
