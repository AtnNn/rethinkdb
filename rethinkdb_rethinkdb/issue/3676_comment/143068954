      "This effort should probably take the form of a script that goes through all of the tests and looks for places where either the `cd` or `ot` is empty for any language defined in `test-runner`. This would give us a good auditing tool going forward. I have been catching these problems as I go through and clean, but they are easy to miss, and there are a lot of files.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this I think I should move the test construction code out of `test-runner`, and into the new `pareseYAML.py` file. That way that file would become a good basis for this auditing tool.\r\n\r\nFor tests that only need to run for a single language, and are writing in the YAML-style, people should include the language code in the name, so like: `test/rql_test/src/datum/binary.rb.yaml`. This will prevent the system from creating empty tests for the other languages, reducing the noise a bit.\r\n\r\nWhen the big test reorganization happens as part of #3442 I fully intend for the yaml-like format to be a useable one, even as a simple way of writing one-language tests for the server."
