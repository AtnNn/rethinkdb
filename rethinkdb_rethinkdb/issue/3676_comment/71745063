      "A lot of what I am finding is outside of `test/rql_tests/src/regression`. A few instances:\r\n- `test/rql_test/src/datum/binary.yaml` (I have partially fixed this in a branch)\r\n- `test/rql_test/src/sindex/truncation.yaml`\r\n\r\nI found these because of unrelated changes that I needed to make (`def`s without assigning things), but I fear that this is a wide-spread problem."
