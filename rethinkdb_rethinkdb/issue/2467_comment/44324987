      "So, the way things are now this is actually sort of hard.  Right now there's nothing stopping you from mixing changefeeds into other streams.  (E.g. you could write `r.table('test').get_all(...).union(r.table('test').changes)`, and you'd get the rows in the `get_all` followed by the rows in the changes.)\r\n\r\nWe could forbid things like that (which would actually be sort of a pain), or we could just say that if any sub-stream of a stream is a changefeed, the whole thing counts as a changefeed.  (Or we could mix `SUCCESS_PARTIAL` and `SUCCESS_FEED` responses depending on which stream of the union we're on.)"
