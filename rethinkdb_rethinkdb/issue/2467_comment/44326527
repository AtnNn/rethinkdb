      "> we could just say that if any sub-stream of a stream is a changefeed, the whole thing counts as a changefeed.\r\n\r\nI think this is the best way of handling this. I'd do that.\r\n\r\n> Or we could mix `SUCCESS_PARTIAL` and `SUCCESS_FEED` responses depending on which stream of the union we're on.\r\n\r\nI like this approach the least. It's the most flexible, but would be the most difficult for users to handle. I think most third-party clients would just break in this case because switching from partial to feed half way is something most people wouldn't expect/predict IMO."
