      "I noticed this a while ago too. It should be pretty easy to filter our functions we don't want. I'm not sure what you mean about the docs -- in bpython I don't get any popup docs for `r` at all (edit: regardless of whether I import as `from rethinkdb import r` or `import rethinkdb as r`). Is that what you mean by clobbering?"
