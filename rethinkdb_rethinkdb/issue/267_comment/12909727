      "```\r\nHelp on function rethinkdb in module rethinkdb.query:\r\n\r\nrethinkdb(exr)\r\n    This package implements ReQL - a domain specific language for\r\n    generation of RethinkDB queries embedded into Python. ReQL can be used\r\n    to query and update the database. It is designed to be very expressive\r\n    (i.e. to support advanced operations such as subqueries and table\r\n    joins), as well as to be user-friendly and easy to use.\r\n    \r\n    ReQL is inspired by jQuery and SQLAlchemy. The jQuery style of\r\n    programming allows queries to be chained to form more complex queries\r\n    in an intuitive way. Following SQLAlchemy conventions, as many of\r\n    Python's facilities as possible have been overloaded in order to make\r\n    expressing queries friendly and convenient.\r\n```\r\nThis is on latest next."
