      "A bit of debugging, and it looks like the `/tmp` directory on newton has gotten slower. Not sure if this is contention or the sign that it is dying. For the moment @mlucy is going to hack `test-runner` with the following line to change where temp files are going:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntempfile.tempdir = 'tempfolder'\r\n```\r\nThat will put the temp files inside that folder (which needs to be created), so away from the slow disk. I will later make a command line switch to do this."
