      "+1  would also love some sort of support for routing functionality similar to pgrouting. My team is currently working on two geospatial apps, one using postgres, the other on mongodb. Rethink was ruled out immediately due to the lack of geospatial indexes/querying but I'd love to reinvestigate this in the future if that feature got added. Being able to have a distributed alternative to pgrouting would be a killer feature. neo4j is the only other db in the space I'm aware of that offers routing.\r\n\r\nAm I correct in assuming that the query syntax would be using geojson? its much easier to read in my experience than the equivalent postgis queries."
