      "@hcarvalhoalves We don't have an extension architecture at this point.\r\n\r\nOur implementation will very likely support at least the following features:\r\n- storing points, lines and arbitrary polygons\r\n- geodesic earth geometry\r\n- querying by intersection with a polygon\r\n- querying the nearest neighbors of a point\r\n\r\nImplementing a generic GiST (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiST) API is worth a consideration, though there could be some problems with combining it with our other features (like compound indexes).\r\n\r\nDo you have specific features in mind that you would need?"
