      "@cultofmetatron -- we'll be debating a specific query proposal here in about ~two - three weeks. I don't know yet what queries will look like, but it'd be awesome if you participated in the discussion when it starts!\r\n\r\nGeo routing looks interesting, but that's a separate feature. We should talk about that separately, it won't be a part of the first geospacial implementation."
