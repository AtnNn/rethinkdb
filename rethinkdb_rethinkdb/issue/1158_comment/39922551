      "@mlucy: MongoDB supports intersection as well as \"within\". The latter is searching for things that are completely within a given query polygon.\r\nBounding rectangles are bad if the polygons are not very \"dense\" if that makes sense (I could draw it on a board here if you like).\r\n\r\nA set of bounding rectangles is essentially what the grid approach comes down to, except that the set of possible rectangles is fixed in case of the grid (which makes them easier to index and process)."
