      "The good news is that mapping a polygon to the set of grid cells it intersects with at a reasonable resolution is already implemented in S2 https://code.google.com/p/s2-geometry-library/source/browse/geometry/s2regioncoverer.h\r\n\r\nIntersection and coverage tests on polygons are also implemented in that library, as well as converting between different coordinate systems. The only disadvantage is that S2 supports geometry on the surface of a sphere only, and not Euclidean geometry (unless I didn't look carefully enough; but the sphere is even in its name, S2 being the sphere with a 2 dimensional surface).\r\nMongoDB, also using this library, supports many of the more advanced operations on spherical geometry only.\r\n\r\nWe could probably implement our own versions of many of the operations for Euclidean spaces, but I suggest that we only support geometry on the sphere at first. That should satisfy most real world applications."
