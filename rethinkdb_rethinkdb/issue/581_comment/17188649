      "Alright I have uncovered 2 bugs using this #727 and #728. I recall seeing one other crash that looked very sindex related but attempts I stupidly didn't copy down the backtrace at the time and have completely failed to reproduce it since. Mostly it's hard to reproduce because #727 and #728 always come up instead. This issue is going to be inactive while I work on the other on those 2 issues since it's not telling me anything new as long as they exist."
