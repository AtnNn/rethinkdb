        "I have not been able to make a multi index work when the indexed values are compound.\n\nThe documentation states that \"the keys in a multi index can be single values, compound values or even arbitrary expressions\" so I thought it should be possible.\n\nI need to model something like a group chat, where each message should be seen by a specific (always small) set of users.\n\nOne way to model a set of message would be this:\n\n```\nr.table(\"msg\").insert({time: 1, topic: \"t1\", users: [\"a\", \"b\"], msg: \"m1\"});\nr.table(\"msg\").insert({time: 2, topic: \"t2\", users: [\"a\", \"c\"], msg: \"m1\"});\nr.table(\"msg\").insert({time: 3, topic: \"t2\", users: [\"c\", \"b\"], msg: \"m1\"});\nr.table(\"msg\").insert({time: 4, topic: \"t1\", users: [\"a\", \"b\"], msg: \"m1\"});\nr.table(\"msg\").insert({time: 5, topic: \"t1\", users: [\"a\", \"c\"], msg: \"m1\"});\nr.table(\"msg\").insert({time: 6, topic: \"t2\", users: [\"c\", \"b\"], msg: \"m1\"});\n```\n\nI would then need to be able to filter by time (a range), topic (a single one), and user (again, a single one).\nSo the ideal query would be something like\n\n```\n...between([2, \"t2\", \"c\"], [4, \"t2\", \"c\"], {index: \"myIndex\"})...\n```\n\nI did a few attempts but I have  not been able to obtain an index that works in this way.\nThe closest I got was reworking the data like this:\n\n```\nr.table(\"msg\").insert({k:[[1,\"t1\",\"a\"], [1,\"t1\",\"b\"]], msg: \"m1\"});\nr.table(\"msg\").insert({k:[[2,\"t2\",\"a\"], [2,\"t2\",\"c\"]], msg: \"m2\"});\nr.table(\"msg\").insert({k:[[3,\"t2\",\"c\"], [3,\"t2\",\"b\"]], msg: \"m3\"});\nr.table(\"msg\").insert({k:[[4,\"t1\",\"a\"], [4,\"t1\",\"b\"]], msg: \"m4\"});\nr.table(\"msg\").insert({k:[[5,\"t1\",\"a\"], [5,\"t1\",\"c\"]], msg: \"m5\"});\nr.table(\"msg\").insert({k:[[6,\"t2\",\"c\"], [6,\"t2\",\"b\"]], msg: \"m6\"});\nr.table(\"msg\").indexCreate(\"imc\", r.row(\"k\"), {multi:true})\n```\n\nThe idea is that \"k\" is a multi-value, and each value is a compound.\nThen I can filter by time, but the behavior of the other values is inconsistent (or at least I don't understand it).\nFor instance, this query:\n\n```\nr.table(\"msg\").between([1, r.minval, \"a\"], [1, r.maxval, \"a\"], {index:\"imc\"})\n```\n\nreturns two entries for \"m1\" (I would expect one), and this returns none:\n\n```\nr.table(\"msg\").between([1, \"t1\", \"a\"], [1, \"t1\", \"a\"], {index:\"imc\"})\n```\n\n(again, I would expect one).\n\nIs this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?\nIf I'm doing something wrong I volunteer to make a pull request to clarify the docs! :-)\n"
