      "I found the cause for at least some of these: in some cases the only thing that is ensuring that the processes get shut down is the `__exit__` handler on the `Metacluster` object in `test/common/driver.py`. This is not guaranteed to be called at process exit. So my solution in the commit above is to add an atexit  handler that will shut down all of the running processes at exit. The branch for this is `larkost/2583-zombie-server-processes` and the CR is 1822."
