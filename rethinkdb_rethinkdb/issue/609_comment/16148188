      "I propose:\r\n* We make the Python driver reset the connection on keyboard interrupt in interactive sessions, same as the Ruby driver.  This gives users a way to stop runaway queries, is easy to implement, and solves the immediate problem.  (Also, I think invalidating cursors on keyboard interrupt in an interactive session is perfectly OK.)\r\n* We open another issue about SIGSTOP/SIGCONT and put it in backlog.\r\n"
