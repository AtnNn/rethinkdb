      "No it isn't some code which doesn't fix that problem is in the outstanding code review.\r\n\r\nEdit: Sorry let me clarify. The code in the code review just errors if the tokens don't match. This means that if someone interrupts a query their next query will receive the response for the first one and error. And their third query will receive the response for the 2nd query and it will error as well and so on and so forth. Please test this scenario to make sure that the way it works is usable and then submit it for review."
