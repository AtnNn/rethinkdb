      "We talked about this a lot in person once.  The Ruby driver implements the behavior I thought we had agreed upon, which is that if the user hits Ctrl+C in an interactive session (IRB for ruby) we reconnect for them (IRB raises its own special exception in this case), but if they receive a signal while running inside a normal ruby process we don't (because, as you note, it would invalidate other cursors).  This still seems like the behavior we probably want (I find it really useful in my interactive sessions).\r\n\r\nCurrently the Ruby client will also fail in the case you describe where we're interrupted after `recv`ing only half of the protobuf.  This shouldn't be too hard to fix though (we should probably open a new issue for it)."
