      "I think we could in theory be able to do `3` it's just that we can't do it right now because the only way to interrupt a query is closing the connection. I think we should just satisfy 1 and 2. Perhaps try to add a lock to fix 4. And ignore 3 for now and when we have an explicit way to interrupt queries we can fix it then."
