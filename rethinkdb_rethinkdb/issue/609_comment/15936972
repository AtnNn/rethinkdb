      "I just looked at the Python driver, and there's a deeper problem here: when we iterate over a batched stream we do nothing until we get to the end of our data, and then we **block on network traffic**.  (Unless I'm misreading the code; I don't know much Python.)  We should almost certainly be requesting the next batch in the background instead of waiting until we're out of data and then blocking; otherwise you have to alternate between processing data on the client and waiting for more rather than doing both in parallel.\r\n\r\nI'll open a separate issue for that, though; it isn't germane to this discussion."
