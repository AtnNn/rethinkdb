      "Hi @nviennot,\r\nthese two queries are indeed very similar.\r\nOne more thing that `get_nearest()` does in this case is that it sorts the result by increasing distance from `point` in an efficient way.\r\n\r\nThey key use case for `get_nearest()` is a different one from what your example does though: Getting a certain number of nearest neighbors around a point, without knowing their maximal distance.\r\nIf you are interested in all points within a certain radius, `get_intersecting` indeed does the job and is usually even faster than `get_nearest()`.\r\nHowever if you are interested in the k nearest neighbors, `get_nearest` with the `max_results` option is always efficient, while for `get_intersecting` you will have to traverse a radius that is often much bigger than necessary."
