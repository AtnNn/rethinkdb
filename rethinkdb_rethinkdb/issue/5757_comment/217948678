      "Thanks for the report @anatol .\r\n\r\nThe warning about `./src/rdb_protocol/lazy_btree_val.hpp:10:19` seems valid. I think this should be `char contents[1];`.\r\n\r\nThe other warnings about the `callable_action_wrapper_t` instantiation look like a false positive. The code that GCC complains about is in the `else` branch of a check `if (sizeof(callable_action_instance_t<Callable>) > CALLABLE_CUTOFF_SIZE)` which should make sure that the code is never executed in the case that the warning is complaining about.\r\n\r\nWe might need to just disable this warning class in the `callable_action.hpp` file.\r\n\r\nAs a work-around, you can compile with `ALLOW_WARNINGS=1` (as usual)."
