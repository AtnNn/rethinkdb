      "> What are the reasons to do it (other than @underrun's use case)?\r\n\r\nIt makes secondary indexes and `order_by` more annoying to implement.\r\n> Why is it annoying now?\r\n\r\nBecause there are things you can do with fixed length keys that you can't do with arbitrary length keys\r\n> Why/how is #364 going to make it easier?\r\n\r\nRange sharding uses functions on keys that only work on fixed length keys."
