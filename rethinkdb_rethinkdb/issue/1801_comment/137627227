      "Hey all, I just encountered this, but found a really easy user-land solution (for my case, at least): I have a long (up to ~500 bytes) token from an external source that I need to use as my primary key to ensure uniqueness for upserts.\r\n\r\nBecause that's way too long, I'm just using a SHA256 hash of the token as the ID, and embedding the token inside the document.\r\n\r\nI think this would apply to the vast majority of use cases here."
