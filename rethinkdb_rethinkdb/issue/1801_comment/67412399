      "+1 just ran into this. Note the limitation also applies when using arrays as the primary key and on top of that you only get 127 characters total, not per element.\r\n\r\nAlso, this might warrant a separate issue but the error message in this case is still just `Primary key too long (max 127 characters)`. This leaves out the fact that there appears to be a two character overhead per element when serializing arrays, making it harder to debug."
