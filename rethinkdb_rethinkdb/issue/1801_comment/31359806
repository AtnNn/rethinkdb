      "I could go round up some of the things we're doing with fixed length keys but I'm not sure how helpful a jumble of little problems is going to be in explaining the difficulty. This is basically just a manifestation of the fact that things are hard to change based on how many things use them. And a lot of things use these keys. Range sharding actually accounts for a high percentage of those usages though."
