        "There has recently been some talk about the scripts used to startup RethinkDB on different systems (#2971, #2104, #2327, #1156, and #2037). We could make some of this conversation simpler by adding an option (command line verb) to the `rethinkdb` binary that would output standard forms of the startup scripts/config-files needed for:\n- rc.d\n- upstart\n- systemd\n- launchd\n\nBy allowing just a few options to this verb we could handle 90% of the use cases, and for the other 10% we would be giving them a leg up by providing a sane starting point. For example:\n\n`rethinkdb startup-script launchd --user rethinkdb --data-folder /var/db/rethinkdb --output com.rethinkdb.server.plist`\n\nThere is going to have to be a lot of thought put into this to make it sane for all of the versions, and decisions like whether to support multiple instances in the same script.\n"
