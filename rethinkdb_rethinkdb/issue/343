        "By @jdoliner:\n# Preamble\n\nStatic value sugar is a technique we use to make several queries quicker to write. In most cases static value sugar is used as a way to quickly represent a function (although this isn't strictly true). In writing reql we seem to all basically be in agreement that sugar like this can make things really nice and a lot of effort is going to be put in to adding more of this post 1.4. I think we should use this page to discuss various proposals and think about the concept as a whole. We seem to have a number of proposals on how to make each function better but not a lot of unification between them.\n# Examples\n\nWe've been able to use an object in filter since 1.2 you can say:\n\n```\nr.filter({\"foo\" : \"bar\"})\n```\n\nwhich is shorthand for:\n\n```\nr.filter(lambda x: x[\"foo\"] == \"bar\")\n```\n# Proposals\n"
