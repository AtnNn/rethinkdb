      "@danielmewes its okay i enjoy helping. So i dont have the table file but i wont upgrade my rethinkdb version and i am sure it will happen again during replication i think it happenes if one of the machiens dies during backfill but not perfectly sure about it. When it happenes i will try ur test i will also package the whole table file for you and everything on that server so u should be able to test it also ur self."
