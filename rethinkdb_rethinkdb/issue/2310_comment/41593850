      "Hi @wojons,\r\nsorry to hear that you've encountered another problem (and sorry you had to hear that apology so often). Did you save the table file by any chance when this happened?\r\n\r\nIf it happens again, could you run a little experiment for me? Can you try starting rethinkdb on the affected data directory without any join parameter and with `--bind localhost`, so that it cannot connect to / be contacted by the other nodes in the cluster?\r\nI would like to know if the problem is triggered by something happening between the cluster nodes, or if it happens locally.\r\nIn either case, It could be helpful to have the data files. So if you could make a backup of the problematic rethinkdb_data directory that would be great."
