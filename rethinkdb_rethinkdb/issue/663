        "`ryexley on IRC had trouble replicating our nodejs chat application.\nHe got this error \n\n```\n[ERROR] 22:47:13 RqlDriverError\n{ name: 'RqlDriverError',\n  msg: 'Unknown datum value `undefined`, did you forget a `return`?',\n  message: 'Unknown datum value `undefined`, did you forget a `return`?' \n}\n```\n\nWhile this error make a lot of sense when the user forget a return in a lamda function for a filter for example, here it was failing for this query:\n\n```\nr.db(\"config.database.name\").table(\"users\").insert( {\n    name: data.name,\n    email: data.email,\n    message: data.message\n} )\n```\n\nAnd the reason why, was because one of the field had the value `undefined`.\nWe should catch undefined values in `r.expr()` and just ignore the key if undefined is returned.\n\nAssigning to @wmrowan, tagging as 1.5\n"
