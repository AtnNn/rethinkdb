      "@eliangidoni Great code. The clustering code is one of the most complex parts of our source tree and you obviously understand it very well, and that after such a short time.\r\nI added some comments. Most of them are minor stylistic things to make the change adhere more to our code standards. The one thing I'm more concerned about it thread safety. I'll have to look at it a little more to figure out if it's actually a problem here or not. I can tell you how to fix it then."
