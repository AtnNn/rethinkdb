      "@marshall007: I have (finally) pushed my branch with an overhaul of the JavaScript connection tests in branch `larkost/5413-javascript-connection-tests`. A lot of this is about better defining our behavior, but there are a lot of failures, both with our current version of the driver, as well as your revision (largely the same issues). I know that @nighelles is looking into these areas, but it seems we are all working on intersecting changes."
