      "You can get a list of all allocated coroutines at the time of the crash by printing the entries of the `total_coroutine_counts` field of the `coro_globals_t` object that `TLS_get_cglobals()` returns.\r\n\r\nThe names in there are not always useful, but it's a start. If that doesn't help, we can probably modify the coro profiler to give us more information. I can help you with that."
