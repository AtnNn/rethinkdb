      "You want to share a query with a third person?\r\n\r\nAutomatically creating permalinks would mean sending all the queries you write (including those with sensitive data)  to a RethinkDB server. That somehow sounds bad to me. \r\n\r\nWe could have a feature to create a permalink for a selected query. We had that at some point on the data explorer that was running on the website. We were creating gist.\r\nWe can probably think about putting it in the web ui."
