      "@danielmewes Any chance of seeing this on the roadmap? The latest features from the RDB team have been stellar, but many of us still pine for transactions to safely manipulate our data. \r\n\r\nIf any form of atomic multi-document manipulation were implemented I'd be absolutely **ecstatic**. This could be full-blown transactions - I naively envision the ideal feature as an array of arbitrary commands, similar in nature to `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, and the database locks whatever it needs to make it happen - but a simple version could have a narrower scope.\r\n\r\nI'd be willing to learn just about any syntax or limitations to get off the ground. Balancing transactional features with horizontal scaling is also clearly a challenge - I suspect several users, like myself, would be willing to trade some of that for this feature.\r\n\r\nI realize that the team has a lot of priorities to juggle and are pulled in many directions, and I greatly prefer quality over speed (and the RDB teams seems to have accomplished both!), but it would be great to have a rough idea where this falls on the next week / next year / next decade / never spectrum."
