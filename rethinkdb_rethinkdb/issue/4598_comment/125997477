      "I think this is really important, also the point about ecommerce. Just as an example, RethinkDB clearly markets itself as a database suitable for realtime \"marketplaces\", but what marketplace would not require transaction support at some point. I understand the concern over a having a consistent feature set but this is so vital, that having it work in some cases at least is definitely better than not having it at all.\r\n\r\nBy working in some cases, I mean that it can either work with the current system even if it will be slow, or it can also be constrained to single cluster scenarios for now if that allows more room for performance."
