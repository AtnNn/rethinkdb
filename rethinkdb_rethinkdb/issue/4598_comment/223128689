      "I think this is a super interesting and useful feature, but also quite hard to implement.\r\n\r\nEven if we ignore performance and lock contention, we will still need to implement a distributed commit protocol, including the ability to either rollback or replay commits on startup after a crash.\r\n\r\nI think a realistic estimate for this is about a year from now."
