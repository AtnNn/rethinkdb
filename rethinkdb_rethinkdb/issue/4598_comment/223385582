      "Once they publish their (open) source code, we could borrow some ideas from [Consus](http://consus.io/).\r\n\r\n> Consus can commit a transaction across multiple data centers in three wide-area message delays during regular execution. Simply sending a message to a remote data center and receiving acknowledgement of its receipt---the bare minimum necessary to tolerate a data center failure---requires two message delays. Protocols such as 2-phase commit or Paxos require two round trips, or four message delays."
