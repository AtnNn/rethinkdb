      "Would also love to see this feature or even get some kind of estimation when or if this is going to be implemented. I would settle for \"stupidly slow\" ones too, because transactions or getting around them are pretty much the last cause of head scratching for my projects and rethink. I feel just being able to trust that all or nothing happened, would be pretty darn valuable. If I got to choose any feature to be added, this surely would be it. "
