      "The problem here is that the order of arguments to merge matters.  The reason Joe did r.merge(..., x) instead of x.merge(...) in #43 is that otherwise it would clobber the field \"rating\".  So we actually have two commands: a left-preferential mapped merge and a right-preferential mapped merge."
