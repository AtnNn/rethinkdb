      "I think that having a command to merges on streams isn't quite what we want. It would still be a bit unwieldy to use it for defaults in pluck which is the impetus for this bug I believe. Using this command you could do:\r\n\r\n    table.left_merge({\"foo\": 0, \"bar\" : 0}).pluck(\"foo\", \"bar\")\r\n\r\nwhich is definitely an improvement over a map but I'd like to have the defaulting built right in to the pluck so I could do:\r\n\r\n    table.pluck([\"foo\", 0], [\"bar\", 0])\r\n\r\nWhich just feels cleaner to me. Once we have defaulting sugar in the places we want it I don't think that a stream merge command is really useful enough to justify the sugar. If I heard about merge on a stream my first guess as to what it did wouldn't be the above behavior it would be merge sorting 2 streams together."
