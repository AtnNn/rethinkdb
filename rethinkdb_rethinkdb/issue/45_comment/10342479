      "I don't think we should call it 'merge' or even 'left_merge'. Perhaps 'defaults' or 'unpluck'? I think such a command would be very useful, even if we did provide defaults everywhere else.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `pluck(['foo', 0], ['bar', 1], 'baz')` api seems pretty ugly to me. Perhaps `pluck('foo', 'bar', 'baz', default=null)`? A little less powerful, but seems much cleaner. If the user wants the more advanced version, they can use `defaults` instead.\r\n\r\n"
