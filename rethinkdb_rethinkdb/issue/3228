        "* If the user calls `r.reconfigure(num_shards, {\"us_east\": num_replicas, \"us_west\": num_replicas})`, they'll get an error because `director_tag` defaults to `\"default\"`, which isn't `\"us_east\"` or `\"us_west\"`. This is confusing. I suggest that we require them to specify `director_tag` explicitly if they specify explicit replica tags. If the user specifies exactly one tag (e.g. `{\"us_east\": num_replicas}`) then we could also default `director_tag` to that, but that special-case behavior might be more confusing than not.\r\n\r\n* If the user calls `r.reconfigure(num_shards, num_replicas, director_tag=\"us_east\")`, they'll get an error because the replicas get put in `\"default\"`, which isn't `\"us_east\"`. This is also confusing. I suggest that we put the replicas in `\"us_east\"` in this case.\r\n\r\n/cc @coffeemug"
