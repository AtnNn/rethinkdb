        "Hi\r\nwhile using **soft durability** and full cluster replication (n/n), can data loss occur if a machine fails?\r\n\r\ni skimmed through the docs\r\n\r\n> Consider using soft durability mode. In soft durability mode RethinkDB will acknowledge the write immediately after receiving it, but before the write has been committed to disk. The server will use main memory to absorb the write, and will flush new data to disk in the background.\r\n\r\nso will the write be immediately acknowledge on every cluster node, or it will propagate to the rest of the nodes only after its written to disk on the initial one"
