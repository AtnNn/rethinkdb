      "Yea I think there are a couple escape sequences that differ slightly as well. ex. `\\uFFFF` in JS would be `\\x{FFFF}` in RE2.\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation behind this was to abstract users away from the `(?<flags>)` syntax RE2 uses and allow them to use the native syntax they're accustomed to instead.\r\n\r\n> If we do this we should probably do it for all three client languages.\r\n\r\nAgreed, however I'm not sure this would add much value in the Python driver since Python doesn't really have a concept of regex literals and flags are already specified using the `(?<flags>)` syntax. I guess we could still support passing compiled regexes for consistency."
