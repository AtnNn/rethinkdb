      "So the original idea with this PR was to simply accept RE2-compatible expressions written using native literals (i.e. it maps 1:1 with what you would have passed `r.match` as a string). I think this is easier to maintain, understand,  and simpler to explain than trying to patch up the differing syntax. I'd be in favor of reverting the translation logic and just adding a clarification in the docs:\r\n\r\n> JavaScript and RE2 regular expressions have slightly different syntax and a different set of available flags. A valid `RegExp` interpreted by the server may not compile, or may match a different set of strings in JavaScript than when used in a RethinkDB query."
