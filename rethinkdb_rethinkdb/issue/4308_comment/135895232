      "It's kinda complicated. I looked for a good test-suite of javascript regex syntax, but couldn't find one. There were some for python and re2 though. Ideally we'd run through a ton of existing syntax examples on test strings, validate that either they both matched the same string (type 0), the re2 library threw an error (type 1) or the conversion function threw an error (type 2).\r\n\r\nThat's a lot of work, and even in the languages with regex literals, it's saving a few characters at most. I think this is neat, but maybe not worth the headache."
