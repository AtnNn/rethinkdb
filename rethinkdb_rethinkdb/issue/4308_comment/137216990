      "Thanks @marshall007. It's really unfortunate to discard your pull request, but I think given that and some of the difficulties with the syntax differences, I'd prefer not to accept the JavaScript Regexp literals in `match`.\r\nEspecially new users sometimes get confused about which operations are executed on the server and which on the client in my experience. Accepting the native Regexp syntax but with slightly different meanings might add to that confusion."
