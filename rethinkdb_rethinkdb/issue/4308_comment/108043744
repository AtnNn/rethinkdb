      "@mlucy The idea is to distinguish two different types of differences:\r\n1. cases where a given regular expression is valid in both JS and RE2 syntax, but has different semantics\r\n2. cases where a given regular expression is valid in JS but not in RE2\r\n\r\nWe would need to translate and/or reject differences of type 1 explicitly in the driver, but it would be ok to not do anything about differences of type 2 I think. Sending such a regex would simply result in an error, which seems ok. I think backreferences are of type 2."
