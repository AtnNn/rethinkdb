      "It seems like the consensus is that we're not going to change what `r.table().info()` returns, except for putting the distribution information in it. So it now looks like this:\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n  \"db\": {\r\n    \"name\":  \"test\",\r\n    \"type\":  \"DB\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"doc_counts\": [\"~180\", \"~228\", \"~183\"],\r\n  \"indexes\": [ ],\r\n  \"name\":  \"foo\",\r\n  \"primary_key\":  \"id\",\r\n  \"type\":  \"TABLE\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI'm going to close this issue. Feel free to reopen if anyone has other thoughts."
