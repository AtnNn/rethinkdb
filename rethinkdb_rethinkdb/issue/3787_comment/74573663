      "Hi @apa512. That's indeed very very slow. Thank you for opening an issue.\r\n\r\nWe're currently investigating a possibly related case where writes are heavily prioritized over reads, slowing reads down over-proportionally. However that's only when using much larger batched inserts so I'm not sure if this is the same problem.\r\n\r\nCan I ask you a few additional questions?\r\n- Which operating system are you using?\r\n- Which version of RethinkDB is this with?\r\n- You say that a normal get without writes takes 200ms. This already seems incredibly high. What is the exact read query you are running? Is is just a `r.table(...).get(id)` or something more complicated?\r\n- How much CPU usage and disk I/O is RethinkDB causing while running a) only the read and b) the read together with the writes?\r\n- Is there a chance you can send us your data and queries so we can try to debug this issue locally? We can sign an NDA if the data is sensitive.\r\n\r\nI think there's something wrong here that updating to a bigger machine likely wouldn't solve. Judging from the amount of memory your machine is already pretty big?"
