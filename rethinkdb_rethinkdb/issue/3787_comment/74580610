      "Sure. Thanks for looking into this issue.\r\n\r\n- Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-24-generic x86_64)\r\n- rethinkdb 1.15.3~0trusty (GCC 4.8.2)\r\n- It's just a simple get(id)\r\n- With writes: ~400 % CPU and ~70 % according to top. Read/Write about 12 M/s according to iotop.\r\n  Stopping the writes lowered CPU to about half but memory didn't change and IO actually increased a little bit). \r\n- I will get back to you about the dump.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I forgot to mention is that the primary keys are two element arrays. Perhaps that's not ideal? I also have quite a few secondary indexes (32 in total and one is defined by a simple function that uses the primary key).\r\n\r\nIs it possible that RethinkDB gets overwhelmed by updating all the indexes?"
