      "Haven't been able to reproduce this locally. My suspicion is that it depends on the characteristics of the i/o system and possibly the exact write queries.\r\nMy best guess at the moment is that it was caused by https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1606 , but that's difficult to say for sure without testing it.\r\n\r\n@apa512 As long as you're just testing RethinkDB on non-production data at the moment, I recommed giving the 2.0 release candidate a shot. You can download it at https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/releases/tag/v2.0.0-0RC1\r\nThe RC includes a fix for #1606, so if that was the issue here there's a good chance that it will solve it."
