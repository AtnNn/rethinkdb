      "Ok, on my own computer now.\r\n\r\nHow is `useOutdated` implemented (with respect to this issue)? Does it bypass the write lock? Is that possible to do? For @realfilip's use case, it would be perfectly acceptable to set `useOutdated` to `true`, but I'm not sure if it actually bypasses the locks on a single machine use case."
