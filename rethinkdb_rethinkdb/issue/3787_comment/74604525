      "Ok that makes sense and sounds about right.\r\n\r\nHere are two small things that might be worth trying in case this is actually bottle-necked in the UI subsystem:\r\n- *reduce* the io pool size. Maybe to 4 or 8 threads. While this will reduce overall i/o throughput, it might also reduce i/o latency.\r\n- run the server with the `--no-direct-io` option\r\n\r\nI think it's more likely that the problem lies somewhere else, but it might be worth a try.\r\n\r\nIf you can give us a data dump that would be ideal. Then we could try to reproduce this locally and could debug the issue more effectively. Please let me know if this is possible. I can send you upload instructions for a secure upload server."
