      "Thanks for the data. The 32 secondary indexes can definitely have a significant impact on performance under writes.\r\nI don't think having a two-element array as the primary should cause any issues though.\r\n\r\nI think we should first try to find out why the gets without any writes are so slow. How are you running the gets? Are many of them running at the same time? How many gets are you doing in total per second?\r\n\r\nIf you have no other load on the server, and just run a single `get`, how long does that take?\r\n(a note on measuring the latency of the read: If you're using the Data Explorer it might be slow to transfer and format the result. I recommend looking at the \"server time\" field in the profiler result instead of the total execution time)."
