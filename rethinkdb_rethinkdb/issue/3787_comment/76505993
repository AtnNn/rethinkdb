      "Actually thinking about it, using outdated reads might be a useful work-around in this specific case, since you are only doing point inserts (no batch inserts).\r\n@realfilip @apa512 it might be worth a try specifying the `useOutdated: true` optarg on `table` in the read queries (http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/table/).\r\n\r\n(I still didn't get to the point where I could check whether our fix works for your case. It's currently constructing secondary indexes, which will probably take about another hour. Will update you once I could run the tests.)"
