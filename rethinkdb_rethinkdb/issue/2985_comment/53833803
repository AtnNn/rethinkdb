      "That sounds bad to me.  If `datum_t`s can be uninitialized, we should have an easy way to test whether they're uninitialized.  It also seems weird to let `datum_t`s be uninitialized and also put them in optionals.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be opposed to having a default-constructed `datum_t` be NULL by default (since that just requires setting the type field)."
