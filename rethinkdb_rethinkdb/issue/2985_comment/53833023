      "I think `datum_t` should have a default constructor. There are many places in the `reql_admin` code where we return `datum_t` by an output parameter; i.e. we default-construct a `datum_t` and then pass its pointer to a function that fills it in. Deserialization does something similar. In both cases we could work around it by explicitly initializing the `datum_t` to `null` or something, but I think having a default constructor is more desirable.\r\n\r\nI think it would be OK to get rid of `has()`, though. So there would be no way to tell if a `datum_t` was default-constructed or not; calling any method of a default-constructed `datum_t` (except the assignment operator, destructor, etc.) would trip an assertion."
