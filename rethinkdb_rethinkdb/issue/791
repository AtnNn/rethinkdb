        "Hi,\n\nI am working with latest version 1.4.5\n\nI tried to use empty /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d/default.conf, the idea is to use default values provided by rethinkdb.\n\nAccording to http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guides/startup/\n\ndefault 'directory' value is  /var/lib/rethinkdb/[NAME], but in reality it seems equal to $PWD/rethinkdb_data\n\nAlso documentation says default 'pid-file' value is '/var/run/rethinkdb/[NAME]/pid_file but in seems it is equal to /var/run/rethinkdb.pid.\n\nPS I think that /var/run/rethinkdb/[NAME].pid is better default value for 'pid-file'.\n"
