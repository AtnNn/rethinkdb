      "hitting multiple shards could be an improvement - depending on how its implemented. if each shard can respond directly to the client then you can increase the aggregate bandwidth of a system. if clients must go through only one shard then you could see an impact.\r\n\r\nbut really, you are implementing a nosql solution here - the major advantages come from the independence of each document. sacrificing anything for the sake of improving performance on a relational query is questionable."
