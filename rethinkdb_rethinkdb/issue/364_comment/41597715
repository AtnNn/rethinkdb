      "> But if we used consistent hashing, then the query would hit every shard. Is this a problem?\r\n\r\nI think this isn't a problem. RethinkDB isn't meant for thousands of shards (and if we ever get there, enough other things will have to change that hash sharding will be the least of our concerns). If you're using a reasonable number of shards (say, under 32), we'll hit all the shards in parallel and then use a merge sort to get the results to the user, which is quite efficient. I think it's a very good compromise for our target goals."
