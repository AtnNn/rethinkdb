      "It's plausible that the new cache changes will have a hard time with the existing stats block (because it expects all write transactions to be drained when flushing, and we don't want that) in such a way that finer-grained out-of-date in memory but up-to-date on disk subtree key counts are kept and updated instead (using the LBA, the way repli_timestamp_t is used).  This would eliminate some of the balance estimate problems we have, but it wouldn't help with keeping shard balance up-to-date, if keys are inserted in some order."
