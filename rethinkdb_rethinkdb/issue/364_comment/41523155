      "If I recall correctly, the main reason for range-based sharding was to make range gets efficient. For example, suppose that the user wants every document whose primary key starts with `http://www.google.com/`, and there are only a few such documents. Then the query gets sent to a single shard (or two shards in the rare case where the shard boundary starts with `http://www.google.com/`). But if we used consistent hashing, then the query would hit every shard. Is this a problem?"
