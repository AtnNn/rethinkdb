      "Datasets with unevenly distributed keys require manual intervention to maintain balance.\r\n\r\nIf I am creating a table for a dataset with keys that I know will have an uneven distribution up front I need to use the cli to set split points before inserting data. possibly this would be less of concern if sharding after data is inserted or rebalancing tables had less of an impact on performance than it seems to.\r\n\r\nit also seems like if i don't have any clue what the split points should be it is difficult for me to create an empty sharded table, and there is no way at all to do so using the web interface.\r\n\r\nobviously there are work arounds, but this is tedious stuff to have to care about."
