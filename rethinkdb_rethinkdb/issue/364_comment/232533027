      "I don't want to butt in to an internal conversation, but you might want to know that we take advantage of the fact that IDs are ordered using array IDs. With array IDs, we can use `between` to filter on the first ID and do a range on the second, and it's very fast. If you switch to hash sharding, it might still be helpful in use cases like ours to keep the IDs ordered on each node so that these queries like that can be just as efficient. Or you could even consider having the classic hash key, range key combination across 2 fields."
