      "This was brought up a while back in #2570. The main issue with having `.run()` take a promise was that you need to be able to call `conn.close()` at some point, but you don't have a resolved instance. This wouldn't be an issue if #4026 happens though, so this might be worth reconsidering.\r\n\r\n> namely, I can't easily use it to run connection-agnostic queries\r\n\r\nI think you can actually instantiate `rethinkdbdash` with `{pool: false}` and just pass a connection to `.run()` as usual."
