      "Another thing that might help: my use case is in setting up apps by synchronously returning the handler that should be passed to `http.createServer`.\r\n\r\nI want to make it so that, if a request comes in before the server connects to the RethinkDB host, running `r.get(req.session.username).run(conn).then(function(user){res.render('loggedin',{user: user})});` within the request handler will delay the response until the connection is established (at which point the query is run), rather than immediately crashing the server with a `undefined is not a RethinkDB connection` error."
