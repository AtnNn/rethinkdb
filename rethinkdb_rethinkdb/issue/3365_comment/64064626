      "> it would be a little more difficult to run on multiple tables\r\n\r\nI don't really think that's a problem, because if you need to deal with multiple tables you can just query the pseudotables directly.\r\n\r\n> I would be pretty strongly opposed to having `.index_status` and `.table.status`\r\n\r\nI kind of don't see it as an inconsistency (or at least it doesn't seem too bad to me). We don't have a native index object, so we have no way around `index_status`. I think the inconsistency between `t.config()` and `db.table_status()` would be much worse (ie. \"why am I getting the table config one way, but status the other way?\") But when it comes to the index, I think \"oh I see, so I get table status this way, and index status that way.\""
