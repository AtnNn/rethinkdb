      "It's also worth noting that `table_config()` / `db_config()` is somewhat different from terms such as `table_create`, `db_create` etc. and also from `reconfigure()` in that it returns a selection, and not actually performs any change directly (unless you chain an `update` behind it).\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting: We already have `.info()`, which you apply on the table or database object.\r\n\r\nThat being said, `table_status` is definitely similar to `index_status` (and `table_wait` to `index_wait`), so it seems like we should at least keep those the way they are.\r\nThat in turn would make `table(...).config()` a little inconsistent with `table_status(...)`.\r\n\r\nI would also like to hear @coffeemug's opinion on this."
