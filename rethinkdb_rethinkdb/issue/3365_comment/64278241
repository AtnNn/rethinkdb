      "I like the `.index()` proposal in general. But I don't like having `.index('a')` return the opaque representation of the index; I much prefer having `.index('a')` being equivalent to `.map(func)`. Also, I'm a little concerned about the growth of this issue; we're hypothetically trying to ship this thing, after all.\r\n\r\nI dislike the `.status('a','b')` and `.config('a','b')` forms. I also don't like `.wait('a', 'b')`, although I feel less strongly about that. So I'd prefer the following: `table.status()`, `table.config()`, `db.config()`, `table.wait()`, `db.wait()`, `table.index().status()`, `table.index().wait()`.\r\n\r\nWe could eventually add `table.index().config()`, which would return a writable single-row selection that would let the user rename the index or possibly change its contents; but let's not do that for v1.16."
