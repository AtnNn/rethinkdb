      "Another advantage of this is that it makes a bunch of the implementations simpler, because we're not supporting so many different variations on the commands.\r\n\r\nI would leave out `r.db().status()` and `r.db().status()`. I'd also leave `table_list()` and `db_list()` the way they are. `r.db().config()` would return a single-row selection with the config document for that database, not the config documents for the tables in that database."
