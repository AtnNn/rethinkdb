      "Another suggestion is that maybe index status should be built into table status. For example, maybe the `rethinkdb.table_status` artificial table should run an index status query and include the results. The same logic might apply to `table_wait()`; maybe `table_wait()` or `table.wait()` or whatever should wait until all the indexes are built in addition to everything else."
