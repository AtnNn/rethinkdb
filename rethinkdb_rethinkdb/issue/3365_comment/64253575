      "I agree with @danielmewes.\r\n\r\nAlso, will `table_wait` accept multiple tables (sort of like `WaitForMultipleObjectsEx`)? If we expect to be able to do that, I'd stick with `table_wait`, otherwise, I prefer `table.wait`. Note that waiting on multiple tables might become really useful, so we might want to keep the door open for adding this functionality (if we haven't added it already)."
