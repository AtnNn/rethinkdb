      "Currently, `table_wait()` can wait for multiple tables. Calling `table_wait()` with no parameters waits for all the tables in the DB. But I actually think we should consider removing that functionality. `WaitForMultipleObjectsEx` is useful because it waits for *any* of the objects to be available. But `table_wait()` currently waits for *all* of the tables to be available, and that can be simulated by just calling `.wait()` on each table in sequence. "
