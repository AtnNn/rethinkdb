      "I like the direction of @mlucy's proposal (there were a couple of proposals there, and I'm purposely saying \"I like the general idea\" rather than getting into the specifics). I think we should implement the proposal for table status/config, but leave the index implementation out of 1.16. We can always go back and make it consistent later; I think it's worth pushing that off, and I think that a temporary inconsistency isn't the end of the world."
