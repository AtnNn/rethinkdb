      "I think @Tryneus also preferred `table.config()` to `db.table_config()` (he mentioned it to me at some point and was going to open an issue -- not sure if there is a dup lying around). @Tryneus -- could you chime in?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I agree with @larkost -- my intuition wrt to these commands seems to be very similar to his. However, I can also see and sympathize with the opposing intuitions. I don't have a really strong opinion, I think either solution would be fine and I don't know if it's worth the effort to make changes to existing implementations. However, if you do decide to make changes and need my opinion, I really like @larkost's intuition on these commands."
