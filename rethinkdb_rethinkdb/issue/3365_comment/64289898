      "> Are indexes conceptually an integral part of the table or separate entities?\r\n\r\nIn the context of RethinkDB, it's pretty clear to me that indexes are a part of the table. If you treat them as separate entities, the user's code (e.g. `get_all` and friends) will break, so treating indexes separately isn't a real choice. This wouldn't be true in the context of SQL (where not having an index doesn't necessarily break your code), and is fairly unique to our design."
