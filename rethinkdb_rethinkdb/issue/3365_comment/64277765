      "Actually, another possibility would be to make `table.index_create('a', func); table.index('a')` equivalent to `table.map(func)`.  I think I actually like that better, because there's currently no way to get the index value for a row.  It would also work for `table.get(id).index('a') => table.get('id').do(func)`, etc. (basically on any selection)."
