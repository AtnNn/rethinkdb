      "I'm not theoretically opposed to this, but the current system is consistent (`table_create`, `table_drop`, `table_config`, `table_status`) while the new one would not be.  It's also consistent with `db_create`, `db_drop`, `index_status`, etc.  Basically we currently have the rule that operations *on* tables, dbs, indexes, etc. are prefixed, and operations on the data *in* tables use chaining.\r\n\r\nAll that said, if other people like this a lot better I would probably be OK with switching."
