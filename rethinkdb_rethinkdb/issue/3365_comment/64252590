      "I agree with @timmaxw that having all three of `table_status()`, `table.status()` and `r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_status').filter(...)` would be a bit too much.\r\n\r\nI also think what @coffeemug said about the inconsistency between `index_status()` and `table.status()` makes sense, i.e. that it's not so bad. @mlucy you had a different view on this. Do you think you could live with `index_status()` and `table.status()`?\r\n\r\n\r\nI think we should do the following out of what @larkost proposed:\r\n- Change `r.db(db).table_config(t)` to `r.db(db).table(t).config()`\r\n- Change `r.db(db).table_status(t)` to `r.db(db).table(t).status()`\r\n- Change `r.db_config(db)` to `r.db(db).config()`\r\n\r\nI'm less sure about `r.db(db).table_wait(t)` -> `r.db(db).table(t).wait()`. I think I would be fine with it either way.\r\n\r\nAny (strong) objections?"
