      "@coffeemug, yes, I had talked about preferring this.  The biggest problems I can think of for supporting `table.status()`, etc, would be:\r\n\r\n* Inconsistent with `index_status`\r\n* It would be a little more difficult to run on multiple tables:\r\n  * Now: `r.db(name).table_status()`\r\n  * After: `r.db(name).table_list().map(r.db(name).table(r.row).status())`\r\n\r\nThe only applies if we drop the old syntax.  That said, I think we should keep the old syntax and the new.  We can easily support `table.status()` and `db.table_status()` using the same term, though this may be a little more complicated for some driver developers."
