      "I believe we should do\r\n* Change `r.db(db).table_config(t)` to `r.db(db).table(t).config()`\r\n* Change `r.db(db).table_status(t)` to `r.db(db).table(t).status()`\r\n* Change `r.db_config(db)` to `r.db(db).config()`\r\n\r\nfor 1.16 and take care of changing the index and `wait` interfaces later.\r\n\r\nWe have limited development time left for 1.16, but since these are new terms we can as well do them right from the start (plus the fact that you have to write `table_config(t)` instead of `t.(table_)config()` has confused at least three people inside this company already)."
