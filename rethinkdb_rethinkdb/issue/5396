        "I wrote about this problem earlier and decided that all right, but I have it again.\nI have gevent and rethinkdb in django project. I try use changefeed in code bellow but It not works.\n\n```\nclass ProjectsNamespace(BaseAuthNamespace):\n    def DB_listener(self):\n        feed = r.table('projects').changes().run()\n        for change in feed:\n            self.logger.debug('changefeed event') \n    def recv_connect(self):\n        self.spawn(self.DB_listener)\n```\n\nThere are no any actions or error message. If i add `gevent.sleep(0)` in for body It works, but application hangs after page reload.\n\nI tried use monkey_patch, Timeouts from gevent, native python thread and python rethinkdb driver from `next` but It did not help.\n\nWhen I tried python driver from `next` somtimes I get error like it:\n\n```\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rethinkdb/ast.py\", line 438, in filter\nreturn Filter(self, *[func_wrap(arg) for arg in args], **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rethinkdb/ast.py\", line 1803, in func_wrap\nif _ivar_scan(val):\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rethinkdb/ast.py\", line 1793, in _ivar_scan\nif any([_ivar_scan(arg) for arg in query.args]):\nAttributeError: 'MakeObj' object has no attribute 'args'\n\n```\n\nMaybe anybody seen the problem early.\n"
