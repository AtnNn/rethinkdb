        "I wrote about this problem earlier and decided that all right, but I have it again.\r\nI have gevent and rethinkdb in django project. I try use changefeed in code bellow but It not works.\r\n```\r\nclass ProjectsNamespace(BaseAuthNamespace):\r\n\tdef DB_listener(self):\r\n\t\tfeed = r.table('projects').changes().run()\r\n\t\tfor change in feed:\r\n\t\t\tself.logger.debug('changefeed event') \r\n\tdef recv_connect(self):\r\n\t\tself.spawn(self.DB_listener)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are no any actions or error message. If i add `gevent.sleep(0)` in for body It works, but application hangs after page reload.\r\n\r\nI tried use monkey_patch, Timeouts from gevent, native python thread and python rethinkdb driver from `next` but It did not help.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried python driver from `next` somtimes I get error like it:\r\n```\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rethinkdb/ast.py\", line 438, in filter\r\nreturn Filter(self, *[func_wrap(arg) for arg in args], **kwargs)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rethinkdb/ast.py\", line 1803, in func_wrap\r\nif _ivar_scan(val):\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rethinkdb/ast.py\", line 1793, in _ivar_scan\r\nif any([_ivar_scan(arg) for arg in query.args]):\r\nAttributeError: 'MakeObj' object has no attribute 'args'\r\n\r\n```\r\nMaybe anybody seen the problem early."
