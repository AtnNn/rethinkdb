        "While using `eachAsync`, I ran into two places where the docs disagreed with the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. The docs say \"`eachAsync` always returns a promise that will be resolved once all rows are returned.\", but in fact `eachAsync` only returns a promise if the `final` callback is unspecified.\r\n\r\n2. The docs say \"If you do not use `rowFinished`, the `rowProcess` callback can end iteration early by returning any value other than a Promise; that value will be wrapped in an error object and passed to `final` if it is provided.\", but instead `final` seems to always receive the same error: \"Row handler for eachAsync may only return a Promise or undefined.\"\r\n\r\n(Note that I'm not really a JS user, so it's possible I'm misunderstanding something with regard to one or both of these.)\r\n\r\n@deontologician -- are these driver bugs or documentation bugs?"
