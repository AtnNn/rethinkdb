        "In our application documents already have an id.  The id is numeric and uniformly distributed.  The default RethinkDB split points for sharding, which expect a string UUID as the id, are invalid for this type of id.  We can rebalance the table after is has been created and we add data to it, but we are likely to create tables continuously, and having to wait for data to be inserted before being able to set appropriate split points is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB should provide configurable range sharding split points at table creation time, or alternatively implement consistent hash sharding, which would obviate the need for split point.
