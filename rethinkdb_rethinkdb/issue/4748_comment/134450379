      "Wow, I had no idea my nested secondary indexes created via the webUI were not even working correctly. I suspect that I am not the first to try `person.name` and assume it works.\r\n\r\nAs a suggestion and improvement to UX, the web interface really should have an alert that only top-level indexes can be created via the web interface. Ultimately the webUI should support nested secondary indexes in the future.\r\n\r\nOne question still. I deleted all my non-working nested secondary indexes via the webUI but did not see any writes per second on the cluster. Is that expected?\r\n\r\nAlso, to confirm, the following is correct:\r\n\r\n    r.db(\"macd\").table(\"daily_closes\").indexCreate('yield', r.row('quote')('yld'))"
