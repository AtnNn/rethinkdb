Create a table, shard over two nodes A and B (no replication)\r\n3. Create one or more secondary indexes\r\n4. Shut down A (or B) and declare it dead.\r\n5. The missing shard gets reassigned to C, but no backfill happens because there is no node to backfill from for that shard.\r\n6. C doesn't create the secondary indexes for the table, while B still has them."
