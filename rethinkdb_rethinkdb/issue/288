        "I just played with the data explorer in next, and it has some quality regressions from 1.3 that we need to fix.\r\n\r\n1. The tree view used to present results in an off-grey div with rounded corners. This div is now gone and instead there is an off-grey horizontal line right before right below the tabs. This line doesn't extend all the way to the right corner. Could we please return the off-gray div? (also, it used to not to extend all the way to the right -- it should)\r\n2. Clicking on the 'full view' button doesn't actually resize the width of the container that presents the results. On a separate note, the button text doesn't change to \"normal view\" once the user clicks on it. Considering that we need to fix the space issues, I think we should move the button above the query text area and actually make it an icon.\r\n3. Issue #191 talked about removing all the extra space between the \"execute/clear\" buttons and the actual results. The issue is now closed, but the space isn't actually removed. We need to remove the space so that users with small vertical space on laptops don't suffer.\r\n4. If I have a nested object and I click on the table view, the object is collapsed by default, but the arrow shows that it is in fact expanded. Furthermore, if I click on the arrow it jumps to an odd location (this is a regression from 1.3.)\r\n5. If there are nested objects of different depths, the right arrow that takes the attributes of an object and presents them as columns in the table has different locations depending on the depth. This is confusing -- it should ideally always be in the rightmost top of the cell.\r\n\r\nEDIT: also, one more:\r\n\r\n6. When I run a query, switch to the table view, and try to resize next to last column, it occasionally resizes the last column. I can't reproduce this consistently, but it happens often enough that it's easily reproducible if you play with it for a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nWe need to be very careful about every little detail of the user experience here because the data explorer/web UI is a gateway for the new users to the database. Could we please be more careful about making and reviewing changes in the web UI?\r\n\r\nAssigning to @neumino."
