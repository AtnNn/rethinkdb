        "I'd like to be able to join a RethinkDB node into a new cluster after start, not using the --join command line option. (Specifically, this would be useful for me w/ my docker + deployment setup.)\r\n\r\nRiak handles this well:\r\n\r\n```\r\nriak-admin cluster join riak@192.168.1.10\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr via their web interface:\r\n\r\n![riak admin console](http://docs.basho.com/shared/2.1.1/images/control_cluster_management_staged.png?1435766058)\r\n\r\nYou can enter a riak node name (which includes an ip) to add into the cluster and then you will see the proposed change and can commit it.\r\n\r\nI think having both of these options would be beneficial for RethinkDB, eg:\r\n\r\nFrom new node, to join existing cluster:\r\n```\r\nrethinkdb join <ip of existing cluster node>\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nFrom existing cluster node, to add a new node:\r\n```\r\nrethinkdb add <ip of new cluster node>\r\n```"
