      "It would be really weird to have a `toString` method that works only on dates (with some special date-specific behavior) while having a `coerceTo('string')` method that does something different and something for everything else.\r\n\r\nWhat's the current behavior of `coerceTo('string')` on date objects (and to/from `$reql_type$` objects in general)?"
