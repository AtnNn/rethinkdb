      "The Python and Ruby drivers prefer lower case for \"iso\". I tried to match this convention. \"toISO8601\" is an exception because of camelcasing. Since \"iso\" is an initialism the casing on all three letters has to match. Except in this case where forced, I actually do prefer lower case \"iso\" since \"iso8601\" feels easier to read to me than \"ISO8601\"."
