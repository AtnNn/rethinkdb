      "The cause is what you'd expect -- that the file size overflowed 2 GB and then bad things started happening.\r\n\r\nFor starters, we use pwrite and pread, ftruncate, all of which take an off_t.  We don't set _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64, we don't call pwrite64 or pread64, in fact, the linux_file_t::set_size function takes a size_t."
