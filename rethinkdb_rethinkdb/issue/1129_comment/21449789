      "Hey all, sorry for the delay. We've determined that it's an issue exclusive to the 32-bit build, which is a lot less tested than the 64-bit build (since overwhelming majority of our users are running on 64-bit systems). That being said, we're on this. This bug is difficult to debug, but we'll get this fixed ASAP.\r\n\r\nSorry you had to run into this."
