      "Currently RethinkDB ships with the JS driver on all platforms because it's used in the web UI (in the Data Explorer where people can type adhoc queries). We don't properly install it though, because of the node issue, so if users want to use the JS driver in Node, they have to install it separately.\r\n\r\nI think it's ok not to ship the drivers. It's pretty common in the NoSQL community to have to install drivers manually, particularly because many users have unusual ways to install things (brew, different versions of Ruby, `rvm`, etc.)\r\n\r\nPython driver is more similar to the JS driver because it's used by some of the tools the server ships with (import/export, for example), and people can't use those tools until the driver is installed. We should package it like we do the JS driver, and people can install it themselves if they want to use it from Python. There is an issue for that -- see #2080."
