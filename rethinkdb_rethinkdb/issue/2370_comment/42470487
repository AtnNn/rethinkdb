      "I certainly found it unexpected that there were no drivers installed after installing a .pkg. The people who are likely to download and install via a .pkg are not likely to be the same people who are use brew or others. But are very likely to be using the built-in versions of either Python or Ruby. So supporting just the default version (Python 1.7 and Ruby 2.0) would probably be enough, but I think that supporting Python 1.6 and maybe Ruby 1.8 would just each be a symlink more.\r\n\r\nProbably the most work here would be packaging up things as a Egg/Gem, which is the preferred format for those directories."
