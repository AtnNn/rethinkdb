      "Great, on a side note I think it would be interesting to check if \"node-protobuf\" is really that faster.\r\n\r\nFrom my basic testing (inserting/reading from rethinkdb) it seems to not give any performance benefit.\r\n\r\nIt may offer a performance benefit in some situations I guess.\r\n\r\nBut I tend to be cautious about \"C++ addons\" being faster than pure JavaScript.\r\nAs an example, the https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres now uses the JS binding by default\r\nbecause JavaScript is \"fast enough\" compared to I/O.\r\n\r\nAlso a lot of hard to debug memory leaks can come from C++ addons while it's easier\r\nto find and debug them in pure JS.\r\n\r\nThanks."
