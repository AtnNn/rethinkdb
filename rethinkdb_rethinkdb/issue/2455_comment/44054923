      "Cool I see,\r\n\r\n    protocol buffer serialization is slower than JSON serialization\r\n\r\nYes, could it be that JSON.parse/stringify() will always be faster than any other implementation using\r\nmultiple fn calls. Since fn calls can be very costly in the JS world. The more you call fns, the slower it gets.\r\n\r\nIs the JSON data compressed and streamed over the wire? Is there an issue I can look at?"
