      "@Tryneus made another suggestion in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4148 : \r\n> I think we should offer 'milestone' releases for well-defined upgrade paths - these should probably coincide with the LTS releases.  Then, it would be very easy to support upgrades from all versions since the previous milestone up until the next milestone.\r\n\r\nI think that sounds reasonable, though I'd like to wait until we understand things better and not do this immediately for 2.1."
