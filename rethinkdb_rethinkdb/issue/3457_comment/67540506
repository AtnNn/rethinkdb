      "I think it would be sufficient to keep support for only one previous version. Since the costs of supporting old versions a little longer is relatively low though, I suggest we allow people to skip one version and keep supporting the last two.\r\n\r\nOnce support for an older reql_version_t is dropped, secondary indexes with that version would become inaccessible right? There should obviously be an appropriate cluster issue, and the usual procedure for migrating secondary indexes should still work."
