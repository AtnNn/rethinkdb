      "I upgraded my test environment from 2.1.5-2 to 2.2.0 and can easily reproduce crashing the server by running `npm test` on https://github.com/hueniverse/penseur which is my thin RethinkDB module. Running the tests fails hard on 2.2.0 with the server crashing half way through. I have downgraded back to 2.1.5-2 and it works as expected.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."
