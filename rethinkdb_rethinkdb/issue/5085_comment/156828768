      "I successfully built RethinkDB from source on my Ubuntu 15.04 system.  I of course also have the RethinkDB official 2.2 system-wide package installed.  The result of the build from source seems to be a new rethinkdb binary.  Would it be fine for me to just do only: `sudo cp build/release/rethinkdb /usr/bin/` and restart rethinkdb.  Then, when the 2.2.1 release comes out, i'll switch to that. \r\n"
