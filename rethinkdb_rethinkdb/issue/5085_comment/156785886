      "@jilen The problem with downgrading to 2.1.5 is that you won't be able to use the data files anymore, since RethinkDB 2.2 will have migrated them to a new format.\r\nI'm currently preparing a hot fix package for CentOS 6 with the bug fix for this. I'll post the link here once the build is done."
