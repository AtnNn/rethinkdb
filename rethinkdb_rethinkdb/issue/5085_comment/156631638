      "@danielmewes -- I don't *think* so, I think that should produce an error in the unshard visitor and we should never get to the guarantee.  We should test it though.\r\n\r\nWe could also get to that error if the clustering code is in a weird state and silently routes the read to a subset of the shards it needs to go to rather than producing an error because some of the shards it needs to go to are unavailable."
