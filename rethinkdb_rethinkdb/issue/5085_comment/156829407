      "OK, everything seems to be working perfectly now.  I'll report any other problems I see.     Incidentally, the site and web servers worked fine with RethinkDB servers randomly failing every 30 minutes, e.g., the clients properly recovered in all cases.  So this bug was also a good test of autofailover."
