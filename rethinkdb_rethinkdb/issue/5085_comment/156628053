      "Ah, sorry, I didn't see #5083 before.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that you have an index which hasn't been upgraded since before RethinkDB 1.16?  Looking at the code, that's the only thing that I think could cause this.  (Although that would be very strange, because we should be refusing to do reads on pre-1.16 indexes in this version.  Right @danielmewes?)\r\n\r\nSorry you've run into two problems with the new release!  The good news is that hopefully they're related."
