        "After speaking with @danielmewes  it looks like if rethinkdb was to run out of disk space it would simply terminate its self and i find that unacceptable. The idea from what i understand is we do not want the node to get reads but not be able to process the writes and be serving out of date info. I agree but if there is code that runs on the local node that is part of a cluster then the node should be come a proxy node it should no longer get reads or writes but should simply proxy to other nodes in the cluster if its a primary it should stay online i guess.\r\n\r\nAlso I think that it should send a message to the driver saying its out of disk space if it the primary. And should send  message to all nodes that are online that htis node is out of disk space. This way if your on the console you will see this. I think this write should also be flushed to all nodes logs so if you open up any logfile you will se the state change. And being on the dhasboard or admin cli will have a please fix.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that should take place is the GC should go into over drive mode trying to reclaim any disk space it can but not let rethinkdb use it this way when admin comes back he has some disk space to use for moving things around."
