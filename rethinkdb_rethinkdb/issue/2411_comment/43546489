      "Michael, Thank you for clear answer, \r\nI understand that sorting is expansive operation without index, but why count is also so time consuming. for example I have simple query, \r\n````\r\nr.table(\"closed_auctions\").map({id:r.row(\"profile\").default(\"\")}).count()\r\n````\r\nthe table is around 9K, it still takes more than `1.20S ` server Time, When I remove my `map` function then it is less than `20ms`. This is not just case of `map` but almost all other sub query the `count` is extremely slow. Is there any way to improve it?"
