      "Does it still take 1.2 seconds if you run it a second time?\r\n\r\n`r.table('test').count()` will be much faster than `r.table('test').map(...).count()` because it doesn't have to load rows off disk before counting them.  If the data's in memory, though, it should be a lot faster than 1.2 seconds.  (Actually, what are the specs of the machine you're running on?)"
