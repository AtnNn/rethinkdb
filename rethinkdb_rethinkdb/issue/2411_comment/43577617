      "I think what's going on here is what @Tryneus alluded to. Without `count` we only return the first batch, but with `count` we have to complete the whole query, so the results aren't comparable. That said, we should still optimize for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- I suspect the final number for the whole query is significantly slower than what you'd get in e.g. MySQL, and we can probably lower it by taking care of low hanging fruit.\r\n- The number for the first batch (430ms) seems quite high for a query like this. I wonder why that is -- there is no reason why we couldn't return the first batch in a more reasonably time (say, 50ms)."
