      "It takes 36 seconds with `orderBy` because `orderBy` here does not use an index.\r\n\r\nThe only way I can think of to use an index here would be to store the `closed_auctions` inside `tbl1` (where each document in `tbl1` would contains all the data of its closed auctions.\r\n\r\nThen you can create an index on the size of the array with something like\r\nr.table('tbl1').indexCreate('closed_auctions', r.row('closed_auctions').count())\r\n\r\nThat way you don't need a sub query and you can use orderBy with an index."
