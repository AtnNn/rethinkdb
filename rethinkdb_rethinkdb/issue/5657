        "hi, java driver 2.3.0 modified  `r.array` definition, but caused problem when passing var args, i want to know why do the modification( sorry, i am not accusing, just need to know if there is any merit, i think this modification is unnecessary).\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/95dfdb28a268f7fe68ab357596e6751baea99c27/drivers/java/src/main/java/com/rethinkdb/gen/model/TopLevel.java#L39\">TopLevel.java#L39</a>\n\n``\nOld:\n\n```\n    public List array(Object... vals){\n        return Arrays.asList(vals);\n    }\n```\n\nNew:\n\n```\n    public List array(Object val0, Object... vals){\n        List res = new ArrayList();\n        res.add(val0);\n        res.addAll(Arrays.asList(vals));\n        return res;\n    }\n```\n\nThe new definition has problem:\n\n```\nList SomeMethod(Object...objs) {\n   return r.array(objs)\n}\n```\n\nCalling SomeMethod(\"a\",\"b\") results an ArrayList which **always contains only 1 element** which is an Object[2], no matter how many arguments you passed to SomeMethod!\n\nThis will not works like previous version which will get ArrayList with 2 elements \"a\" and \"b\".\n\nSo,\n\nAssume I have table(id, firstName, surName) which has a compoundIndex consists of [firstName, surName], and make a function `MyGetAllByCompoundIndex`, \n\n```\n    GetAll MyGetAllByCompoundIndex(Object...compoundConditions) {\n        return tbl.getAll(r.array(compoundConditions)).optArg(\"index\", \"someCompoundIndex\");\n    }\n```\n\nI know it's better to define two fixed parameters:\n\n```\n    GetAll MyGetAllByCompoundIndex(Object firstName, Object surName) { \n```\n\nBut for some reason it's already designed as variable arguments and it works fine before 2.3.0.\n\nAssume i use the function like this:\n\n```\n   someReql.map(row -> r.hashMap(\"ary\", MyGetAllByCompoundIndex( row.g(\"firstName\"), row.g(\"surName\")).coerceTo(\"array\"))).run(con)`\n```\n\nThen this will not works.\n"
