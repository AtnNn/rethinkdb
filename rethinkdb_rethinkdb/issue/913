        "I went through the spec carefully, and tried making a typescript definition file for the node.js driver. \n\nWould you be interested in distributing it with the node driver? Please let me know if anything is incorrect, it was kind of challenging to figure out what a good model would be.  In some cases it is probably more specific than the underlying driver code. \n\nhttps://gist.github.com/seanhess/5658557\n"
