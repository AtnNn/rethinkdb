      "There are two things going on here:\r\n* The drivers are wrapping `r.args` in a function, which they probably shouldn't be.\r\n  - This could be fixed in the drivers, not sure how hard this is.\r\n  - If we moved to supporting `r.row` on the server, we could fix it there.\r\n* You can't store a function in an array, so `r.args` won't work if one of the arguments is a function."
