      "I think duck typing should be sufficient. The only place we test the `instanceof` for a connection is in `.run`, and it's only a belt and suspenders check. We'd otherwise raise an exception if the thing passed to `.run` didn't have a `_start` method, which I think is exactly what this issue is suggesting we do. It's a private method (starting with an underscore) so it should be clear that the interface isn't guaranteed to be stable.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: I think we should just drop the `isConnection` check in `run` and not worry about the magic number stuff. `isConnection` should remain as it is since it may be used in client code somewhere."
