      "Just dropping a few thoughts. I used to be think that this was a bad idea. I think it's fine and actually has valid situations now (especially since there are more and more packages using rethinkdb). It's also something that would let me create fake connections for reqlite :-)\r\n\r\nThat being said, I just want to clarify something. The connections in `rethinkdb` and `rethinkdbdash` are not compatible and won't be (except if one of the driver changes a lot) because the way these two drivers build the query are different. `rethinkdb` call `build` and build the query at run time, while `rethinkdbdash` build it when each term is called (the query is stored in `_query`."
