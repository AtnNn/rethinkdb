      "Also, I kind of agree with @danielmewes on using a sentinel value, similar to `protodef.VersionDummy`, instead of a test for the presence of `_start` to test for compatibility (so that if two different versions expect `_start` to behave differently, `run` won't go ahead and charge into an unreliable codepath), but that's with me having no familiarity with how much the internal implementation changes from version to version. It could be that strong integrity around edge cases would end up making the value virtually equivalent to `instanceof` when it comes to spanning versions."
