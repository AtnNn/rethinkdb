      "You're right, it's not a solution and I think it deserves a fix too. What do you mean by self-contained modules?\r\n\r\nAs for your second point, I think it would be difficult to manage a connection pool as an abstraction over the current `Connection` interface without significant changes. Connection pooling is being discussed in #281 so you may also want to mention over there that you're interested in the ability to pass in your own pool implementation and/or low level APIs for managing connections in the pool."
