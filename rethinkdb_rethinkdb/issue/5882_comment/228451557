      "@contra Sure! A PR would be awesome.\r\nI think it would be nice if one could specify arbitrary run options, and not just `arrayLimit`. But I'm not sure which way makes most sense from a UI perspective.\r\nAnother one that comes up frequently is setting a default database other than `test` for example (which can be done through the `db` option to `run`)."
