      "> It would be nice to have a way to access these errors for documents that existed before you created the index, too.\r\n\r\nThat would be more complicated though because index post construction is a background process (and there could be a lot of them). So we would need to store them somewhere and allow users to retrieve them later. I think we shouldn't do that unless someone feels really strongly about it."
