      "This is a little out-of-left-field, but what if we added an optarg to `index_create` that made its response a changefeed? Then the list of errors could be the errors generated during processing and the changed would terminate when the index creation completed (or was stopped).\r\n\r\nThis would probably be easy to wrap in the WebUI. If we really wanted to go nuts it could also send back occasional percent-complete messages to make this even more friendly for reporting."
