      "well, if it helps, the table i was working on was 4 shards and 2 replicas across 4 rethinkdb servers. the table had 2 secondary indexes that were created before any data was inserted into the table (because adding secondaries after data is in a table has bitten me so many times). the primary key is an alphanumeric string. the documents are between 0.5k and 1k (ish). i'm continuously inserting data via 16 threads. all my inserts are going to 1 instance of rethinkdb (not the one that experienced the crash).
