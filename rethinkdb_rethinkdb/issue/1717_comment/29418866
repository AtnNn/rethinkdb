      "@underrun: Reacting to errors like this on a more localized level (e.g. per table) would be nice, but unfortunately that is almost impossible to do in a general way. The problem is that it is difficult to a) determine whether a failure like this is limited to a single table, or could affect the integrity of other tables as well and b) to \"crash\" a single table cleanly without affecting other tables. We will definitely do (and sometimes already do) this for errors which we know can happen due to failures out of our control and for which both of these criteria can be implemented. However that doesn't (and cannot) help for bugs like this one where we don't even know what it is caused by yet.\r\n\r\n@neumino : Can you say something about @underrun's suggestion for auto-rebalancing shards if a node has gone down? The way I understand the suggestion this is already possible once one declares the failing server dead, isn't it? (Edit: I think I misunderstood this. Seems that it wasn't necessary in this case to declare it dead, because the server could just be restarted. What I don't understand though is why any re-pinning was required.)\r\n> give me a way to auto-rebalance shard locations (or restore them to a previous state) rather than requiring me to manually shuffle things around."
