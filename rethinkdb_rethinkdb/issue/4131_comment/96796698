      "Hi @thenightwassave. This is by design. `and` always returns the first argument that is falsy.\r\nWe considered changing that at some point, but decided against it. See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3562 for the discussion.\r\n\r\nAs for `or`: It should always return the first truthy argument, or the last argument if there is none. It seems like there's a bug actually:\r\n```\r\nr.expr(false).or(null) // false\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect this to return `null`. @mlucy ?"
