      "@andyburke -- it helps to call `cursor.close()` (though if you don't, nothing catastrophic should happen).\r\n\r\nWe could add an optarg to `next` that tells it not to call the error callback on finish (and potentially make it the default). Does anyone have an opinion on that? We want to be compatible with other Node.js database APIs, though, and I think the way we do it now is usually a standard API."
