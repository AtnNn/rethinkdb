      "@andyburke -- it's normal to get back `null` elements.  For example if you have a table `test` with the three documents `{field: 'foo'}`, `{field: null}`, `{field: 'bar'}` and you write `r.table('test')('field')` you'll get back the stream `'foo', null, 'bar'`.\r\n\r\nIt's true that you expect to reach the end of the cursor at some point if you're just calling `next` over and over again.  But if you're planning to iterate over the whole stream until you reach the end, `each` is probably the right tool for that."
