      "I understand that hasNext() would need to be async. That doesn't bother me that much.\r\n\r\nI realize this would be a compatibility issue, but another alternative I think would be more obvious would be to make next() not call back with an error when the cursor is empty. I mean, cursors usually eventually run out of things. That doesn't seem like an exceptional (error) case to me. The only way I can think of that it would be a problem is if you expected null documents, which seems unlikely. At least then I could do:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncursor.next( function( error, user ) {\r\n    callback( !!user ? 'Existing user!' : error );\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe alternative of checking for a particular error seems wrong.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the case where i am calling .next() do I need to call cursor.close()?"
