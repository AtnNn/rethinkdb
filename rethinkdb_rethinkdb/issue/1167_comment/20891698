      "This is a lot like how update works. If merge supported this behavior then we could get close to a pretty intuitive mapping between \"regular\" operations and \"side-effecting\" operations:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmerge <==> update\r\ndo/map <==> replace\r\nappend <==> insert\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we think through this idea we might be able to round out the mapping with a few more tweaks like this here and there."
