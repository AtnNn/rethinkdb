Before the system crashed there were maybe 1.2 million docs in the system. When it came back on it had about 300k.\n\nAfter sharding from 10 to 5 adding another replica document count started going up and down. jumped up until it got to 1mllion and now the value keeps changing from 900k to 1.2 million again no inserts are going on.\n"
