      "I'm not sure that I like the driver returning the db/table object.\r\n\r\n```\r\nt = r.db('foo').tableCreate('bar').run()\r\nt.insert(...).run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see the convenience argument, but it always seemed odd to me. I like `{ created: 1 }` -- it's less convenient, but it's also nice and clear and I can't imagine anyone getting confused by it."
