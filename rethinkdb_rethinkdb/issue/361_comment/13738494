      "To be clear this is a purely driverside thing. I find myself repeating a similar idiom frequently:\r\n\r\n    r.db(\"foo\").table_create(\"bar\").run()\r\n    bar = r.db(\"foo\").table(\"bar\")\r\n\r\nThis just compacts that in to a single line. Also note that @al3xandru is something I don't consider part of the proposal (although it might be a fine idea unto itself) because it requires server support."
