      "I think a much better behavior for the `insert` would be:\r\n\r\n1. return the same result object as we do now\r\n2. the client lib should fill in the id field for the objects passed to `insert` that do not already have one \r\n\r\nBasically step 2 would remove some boilercode that users will always have to write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy_objects = [...]\r\nresult = r.table('table').insert(my_objects)\r\nfor idx, id in enumerate(result['generated_keys']):\r\n   my_object[idx]['id'] = id\r\n```\r\n"
