      "Because in the thread we talk about returning a reference to the newly created database/table instead of `{'created':1}`.\r\n\r\n@mlucy says \"aving them instead return references to databases and tables would require both driver support and a protobuf change, which is unlikely for 1.4 but plausible for 1.5.\" suggesting this as a 1.5 feature.\r\n\r\nThen someone named @coffeemug who spoke the last word on the subject adds \"Returning the table/db object still seems odd, but I don't feel too strongly about it\" implying that no final decision has been made on the issue.\r\n\r\nAre you now making a final decision?"
