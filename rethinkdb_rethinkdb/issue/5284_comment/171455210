      "@deontologician thank you so much for your valuable feedback. My bad with the tests and will try and fix it ASAP.\r\n\r\nNow, regarding the split of the `SSLConnection`, the thing is in Java an `SSLSocket` is actually a wrapper of `Socket`. Whatever operations you do in the underlying `Socket` affect the wrapping `SSLSocket`. So, breaking it apart it seems would only duplicate code."
