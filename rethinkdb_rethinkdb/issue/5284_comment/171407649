      "Ok, so I like this mostly. Other than the what I noted inline (fixing the generated test template), I think the SSLConnection should be a connection subclass, and not have the `connect` method split with a large `if/else`. This would also solve the problem of the socket and sslsocket being nullable, since only the sslConnection would have the sslsocket.\r\n\r\nI think the builder should create an SSLConnection instead of a normal Connection if it's passed an SSLContext"
