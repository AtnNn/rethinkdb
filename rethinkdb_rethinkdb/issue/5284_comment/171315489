      "In order to test this, I'm using [this code of mine](https://github.com/pires/rethinkdb-ssl-test) and a Compose.io cluster. It should be pretty straightforward to test with your own installment, both secure and unsecure.\r\n\r\nIt should be the responsibility of the user to provide `SSLContext` to the `Connection.Builder` exposed by `Rethinkdb.r.connection()`. This way, the driver is agnostic to the different SSL scenarios each user may provide."
