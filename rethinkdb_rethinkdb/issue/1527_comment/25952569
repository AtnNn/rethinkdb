      "I think that a RESTful API gives much more possibilities to integrate RethinkDB into an infrastructure.\r\nNowadays is common to provision servers via API and it would be very nice to be able to instruct RethinkDB via API too.\r\n\r\nLet's imagine you are provisioning some new servers for RethinkDB, you have servers up, with a couple of API call you would be able to setup RethinkDB's cluster (or expand an existing one).\r\n\r\nWithout the API you should write some scripts which connect via SSH to RethinkDB, execute rethinkdb admin an send some commands or overwrite some config files.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing (having an API in place) is that you would be able to split the administration interface from RethinkDB (if API gives same data/commands as the webUI)\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents :)"
