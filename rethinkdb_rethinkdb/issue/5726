        "I'm using rethinkdb cluster version 2.2.5. One of my tables was containing millions of documents taking more than 100Gb of disk space. But after I deleted the data down to 7k documents, I don't see the disk space reduce, it is still taking more than 100Gb for that table. From the admin UI, the total disk used shows only 62 GB, much less than the actual table size stored on disk. Is that normal or am I missing some configuration?\n"
