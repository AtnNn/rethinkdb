      "I realized  (a while back) that this feature would make my suggestions on #746 and #4008 about non-deleting variants a lot easier and also more explicit (i.e. better) than using TTL-like functionality. At least in most of my cases.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n`table.filter(r.lazy(r.now()) >= r.row['expires_at']).changes()`\r\nvs (using a TTLified index):\r\n~~table.changes()~~\r\n\r\nWhat I guess I'm trying to say is that this feature is more generic :)\r\n\r\n_edit: no no, the \"TTLified index usage\" example would of course be nothing at all, no code, as the TTL-deletion will be handled completely on server-side without client involvement._"
