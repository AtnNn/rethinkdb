      "@shadowcodex Not yet. We still need to discuss how exactly we're going to support this.\r\n\r\n@larkost had an idea for how we could support `r.now()` as an argument to a `between` in a changefeed. We would basically maintain the element that's going to get into the `between` range next using the index (essentially the next larger element after the current `r.now()` timestamp). Then we'd set a timer for when that happens, send a change event for the now included element, and update that element."
