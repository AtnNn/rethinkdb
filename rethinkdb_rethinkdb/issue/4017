        "In branch `larkost/2649-connection.js-failures-v2` (#2649) the two \"close twice\" tests have been made deterministic and this has exposed that the second `close` command is never returning . Since most uses of `close` are nearly throw-away this is not going to be a big deal for most uses. But since the JavaScript model is so intertwined it would be easy for people to accidentally be caught in this.\n\nNote: until CR 2773 is merged this will only be clearly visible in the branch listed above.\n"
