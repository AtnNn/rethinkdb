        "This came out of an internal discussion on Slack:\n\n@encryptio wrote: \n\n> there's also `majflt` (\"The number of major faults the process has made which have required loading a memory page from disk.\") in `/proc/[pid]/stat` but i'm pretty sure we don't want \"any\" major fault to raise issues, just if the number of major faults per minute exceeds some value (after a startup period where they may spike due to loading code from disk)\n\nWe think that we should change our swap detection code on Linux to use changes in `majflt`. The first value after one minute should be ignored (in case faults in the `rethinkdb` binary or other libraries are counted), and after that we should raise the issue if `majflt` increases by more than a certain number of faults per minute.\n\nI think the limit should be maybe 200 FPS (faults per minute).\n\nIf we do this, we could also probably reduce the duration for which the swapping issue is displayed from the current 1 hour to maybe 10 minutes or so?\n"
