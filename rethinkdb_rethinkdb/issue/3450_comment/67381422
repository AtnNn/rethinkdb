      "The init script needs to know where the pid file is for the `stop` and `status` commands. It currently parses the config file to find the value of the `pid-file` option. What I am suggesting is that the init script should instead pass the `--pid-file` option to RethinkDB (and set it to `/var/run/rethinkdb.pid` as you suggest).\r\n\r\nThe init script also parses the config file to read the `log-file` option. The only purpose of this is to print a `logging to $log_file` message. I want to get rid of this so that the init script no longer has to parse the config file. Perhaps `rethinkdb --daemon` should display this message itself before hiding in the background."
