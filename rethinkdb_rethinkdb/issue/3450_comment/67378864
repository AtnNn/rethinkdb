      "That sounds good!\r\n\r\nCould we add log and pid file location parameters to the `rethinkdb` binary instead of getting rid of them? Especially being able to change the log file location would be very useful I think.\r\nFor the pid file, a benefit of putting it into a system folder like `/var/run` is that the OS can clean this folder on startup, in case the system crashes."
