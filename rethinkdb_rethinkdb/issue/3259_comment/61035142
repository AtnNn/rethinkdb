      "It looks like Python 3.4 added another argument to `multiprocessing.queues.SimpleQueue` construction.  The given line works fine in Python 3.3 and 3.2.  We should add some more compatibility handling here (and probably get some simple automated tests running so we're more confident in the portability of this script).\r\n\r\n@EddyShure - as a workaround, could you run the script directly using an earlier version of python?  Thanks for bringing this to our attention!"
