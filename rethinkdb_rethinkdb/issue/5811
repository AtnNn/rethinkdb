        "I have been seeing an occasional error when compiling against the downloaded OpenSSL header files on MacOS (this is always using downloaded headers). Specifically:\r\n```\r\nIn file included from src/arch/address.cc:19:\r\n./src/arch/io/network.hpp:8:10: fatal error: 'openssl/ssl.h' file not found\r\n#include <openssl/ssl.h>\r\n         ^\r\n```\r\nIf I re-run `make` immediately afterwards with the same settings it works fine. It only appears to happen when I clean out the build products. My assumption is that we don't have a dependency quite right, and so `make` is sometimes scheduling that line before we have OpenSSL downloaded and setup right."
