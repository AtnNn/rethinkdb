      "Thanks for the report!  Sorry you ran into that.\r\n\r\nTo a certain degree this is expected because we picked the batch size for delete operations to stop them from interfering with other operations as much as possible, which will slow them down, but I talked to @timmaxw and he said you were seeing a factor of five difference, so there's probably something else going on as well.  We should look into this.\r\n\r\n(@danielmewes, any insight on this?)"
