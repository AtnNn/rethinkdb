      "@danielmewes Its a four server cluster.  Networking is dual bounded 5Gb/s PCIe ethernet interfaces.  I've run a number of tests with different number of tables (from 1 to 50) with 4 shards and 2 replicas. 5 secondary indexes.  Data fits on RAM easily (around 378GB RAM per box).  About 12GB of test input data with 10 million documents. Latest version of RethinkDB."
