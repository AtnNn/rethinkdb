      "@eliaslevy a few questions to better understand what might be goign on:\r\n* Is this on a cluster or a single server?\r\n* If it's on a cluster, how many servers do you have, what's the network connection between them like, and how is the relevant table configured (number of replicas / number of shards)?\r\n* Are there any secondary indexes defined on the table?\r\n* What's the approximate size of the data? Does it fit into RAM or is it too large for that? (also are the disks SSDs or rotational disks?)\r\n* Which version of RethinkDB are you running?"
