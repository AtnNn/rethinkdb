      "@eddyfosman That's weird. What are the permissions on `/root` (`ls -ld /root`)?\r\nCould it be that the `rethinkdb` user doesn't have read permissions on it?\r\n\r\nIf that's the case, we should obviously improve the error message \"The directory '/root/test_rethinkdb' does not exist\", since it's misleading in this case."
