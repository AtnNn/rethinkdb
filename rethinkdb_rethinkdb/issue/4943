        "For @deontologician ,\r\n\r\nAfter some protocol debugging in the C# driver, it appears the Java driver is also affected. Per the Python source code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass FunCall(RqlQuery):\r\n    tt = pTerm.FUNCALL\r\n\r\n    # This object should be constructed with arguments first, and the\r\n    # function itself as the last parameter.  This makes it easier for\r\n    # the places where this object is constructed.  The actual wire\r\n    # format is function first, arguments last, so we flip them around\r\n    # before passing it down to the base class constructor.\r\n    def __init__(self, *args):\r\n        if len(args) == 0:\r\n            raise ReqlDriverError(\"Expected 1 or more arguments but found 0.\")\r\n        args = [func_wrap(args[-1])] + list(args[:-1])\r\n    .....\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems like the actual wire-line format is function first, arguments last, so we flip them around when building the AST.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `Funcall` template that overrides `build()` moving the last argument to the first. It's been about 14 years since I wrote Java, so I hope this is correct. :)\r\n\r\nThis should also get a few more unit tests to pass.\r\n\r\nP.S.: I tried to keep the PR as small as possible so the AST should get regenerated."
