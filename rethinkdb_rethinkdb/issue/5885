        "This would create consistency with `getAll` (and ultimately across all of these index-aware filters) and remove some **major** performance bottlenecks when working with geospatial indexes. Seems like a really easy win.\r\n\r\n#### Current situation:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nboundaries.concatMap((b) =>\r\n    r\r\n      .table('SomeCoolData')\r\n      .getIntersecting(b, { index: 'location' })\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- You have to query the entire table multiple times, once for each boundary\r\n- `.limit()`ing the main query does nothing to limit the amount of computation\r\n\r\nRunning a simple query like \"find all points within this boundary\" across 100,000 records **runs forever and never completes**. Even with a tiny # of records RethinkDB is not suitable for any real geospatial querying.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed solution:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr\r\n    .table('SomeCoolData')\r\n    .getIntersecting(r.args(boundaries), { index: 'location' })\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Only runs one query on the table\r\n- `.limit()` works as it should"
