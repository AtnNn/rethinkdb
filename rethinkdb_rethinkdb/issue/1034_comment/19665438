      "Thanks again @ConceitedCode! Merging this one will also require making similar changes to the other drivers and adding the appropriate tests. I'll create a branch for the issue, merge your pull request, and then fill out the rest of the fix. Since this is a relatively important fix and only concerns the drivers, we should probably be able to get a point update for the drivers out tomorrow. Thanks for calling attention to this and providing a fix."
