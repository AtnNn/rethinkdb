      "The fix for the incorrect parameters has been approved and merged to `next` in commit 2576752, review was 3005.  Will be in release 2.1.  At this point, since I haven't been able to reproduce any `unexpected response` errors, and I haven't heard back from @ezeike, I'm going to assume that error was due to using a single connection concurrently across threads.  Please reopen if this is not the case."
