      "For the record, the line can safely be changed to `self.close(noreply_wait=False, token=None)`, because the token is only used if we send a noreply_wait.  Looking into why we might get an unexpected response.\r\n\r\nI suspect this might be because of a cursor being closed while a response is on the wire, but we're releasing it from the cursor cache too early."
