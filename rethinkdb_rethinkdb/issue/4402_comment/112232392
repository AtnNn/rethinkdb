      "Well after looking at the code it doesn't seem to be calling the cursor `close` as I had speculated, but it's not calling `Connection.close` either. Instead it seems to be calling `ConnectionInstance.close` which needs a token (though that token should be a new token I think, not the token of the read response)."
