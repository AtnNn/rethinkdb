      "Thanks for the issue report and for investigating the problem @ezeike !\r\n\r\nSo it seems like there are two problems here.\r\nObviously we should fix the problem with `close`.\r\nI think what's happening here is actually that it's calling the wrong `close` method, namely one that's meant to be used for closing cursors, while it looks like that it means to call the `close` method to close the connection.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus could you take a look at that please?\r\n\r\nThe other question is why you got an \"Unexpected response received\" error in the first place.\r\n\r\n@AtnNn Do you know where the \"2.0.0.post2\" pip driver version is coming from? Is this actually a version that we've used at some point?"
