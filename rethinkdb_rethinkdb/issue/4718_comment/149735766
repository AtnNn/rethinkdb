      "In another project I have learned that `pip` does not install `.egg` zip files by default, but rather a format closer to the `bdist` one. However `easy_install` does (guess which I use normally). So it might be better to normally use the `bdist`-produced format, and but make it possible to use an `.egg` zip file on command."
