        "`gevent` and `twisted` do not run on Python 3.0-3.1.x, so we should exclude those tests from those versions of the interpreters. Currently we only have the ability to choose specific versions (multiple), so need to introduce the ability to do something like:\n`connections/twisted_connection.py2.7-,3.2+.test`\nThat is not the prettiest of names, but it wold get the job done, and we already support the comma in the middle, so this would only be adding the `+` and `-` to the equation.\n"
