It's a little non-obvious right now.\r\nOur plan for solving this issue is actually being discussed in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2692 (it's a bit more generic and also applies to general updates of subfields, not just deletions of fields). Please feel free to chime in over there."
