      "The offending perfmon comes from the sindex mod_queue (an `internal_disk_backed_queue_t`) created in `bring_sindexes_up_to_date()`. It uses the same io_backender as the main store, so that explains the other backtraces we have seen.\r\nApparently the mod_queue is not always destructed before the btree store is."
