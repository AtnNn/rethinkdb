      "Valgrind's memory leaks were all either protobuf or v8 noise that has now been suppressed, or one other unrelated low-severity memory leak that has been fixed.  So the strategy of using valgrind to see if some serializer is being leaked somewhere has failed.\r\n\r\nSo the status of this issue is: I don't know what the problem is, and I can't reproduce the bug.\r\n"
