      "Hmm so we rely on the destruction order of function arguments in `post_construct_and_drain_queue()`. The arguments have both an `auto_drainer_t::lock_t` as well as a `boost::shared_ptr<internal_disk_backed_queue_t>`. The latter must be destructed first. I don't know, it seems like either that doesn't work when compiling on CentOS, or a copy of the shared_ptr survives in the boost::function object for longer than the copy of the lock_t.\r\n\r\nIf I remove the shared_ptr and instead use a regular pointer and wrap it into a scoped_ptr_t at the beginning of the function it works.\r\nThere is also another related place where we don't hold an `auto_drainer_t::lock_t` for long enough."
