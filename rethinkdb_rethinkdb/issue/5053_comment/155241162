      "Thanks for the PR @igorlukanin .\r\n\r\nWe actually have some tests that are automatically generated from the yaml files in `test/rql_test/src`, including a wide variety of `filter` tests. @deontologician can tell you how to run them.\r\n\r\n@deontologician Do you think it makes sense to add a manual test like this anyway? I think it's probably not that useful, given that we already have tests for this.\r\nI can see a use as a code example, but we will have full API documentation for the Java driver including `filter` examples done very soon."
