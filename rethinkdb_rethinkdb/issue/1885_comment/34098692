      "Just ran into this, and had a discussion with some of the devs on IRC. My machines have 6-SATA disk hardware RAID5, and it was doing a few thousand TPS, and only doing a few blocks per second. I reduced the table to one shard to try and reduce random IO, but it was still replicating very slowly. I ended up following the advice in this ticket, by removing the table file from the replica and restarting replication. Then it went up to 400-500 sustained writes/sec, and in ~15m has already passed the amount of blocks it completed by running all night previously.\r\n\r\nSo, I think for people with spinning disks, current best practice should be no more than 1 replica per table per system."
