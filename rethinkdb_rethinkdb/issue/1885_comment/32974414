      "I could mostly reproduce this. I can get backfilling which becomes very slow towards the end. I don't see the high disk write throughput though (in fact it is very low, less than 1 MB/s on average).\r\nIn my experiments it only happened when the sender of the backfill is on rotational disks, so it doesn't seem to be a problem on the writer's end.\r\nIt's well possible that this is simply bounded by random access times on rotational disks (iostat reports ~500 tps on the drive)."
