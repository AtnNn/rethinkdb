      "@nergdron one thing to check is the disk usage on both the primary on the secondray. I have seen in one bug where the secondray was backfilling but is mark larger then the primary. Also you can stop the master and copy the table file the primary to the secondray and then reboot the nodes and the secondray will be magically synced up with the primary but you have to stop both machines."
