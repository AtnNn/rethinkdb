      "@wojons It's 6 x 2TB SATA disks in hardware RAID10 with 512MiB BBU write cache, 48GiB of RAM, 2 x E5645 Xeons for each node. The storage is pretty slow at random IO, but reasonably speedy at block IO. It's not SSDs because this is the hardware I had free when I went to set up our test cluster, and because we tend to like to test on underpowered hardware so we can see where things break a little easier. That's definitely what's led to the tickets I've opened, so it feels like the right approach. ;)"
