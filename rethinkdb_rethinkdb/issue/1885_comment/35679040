      "Hmm so I tested with the older cache and without the patch for #1971. The impact of GC is much higher there (it basically cuts backfilling throughput by a factor of 10). So it seems that I can reproduce what @wojons and @nergdron experienced.\r\n\r\nHowever the backfilling performance when not GCing is also by a factor of roughly 10 higher than in our current version of the new cache (this is a regression, and being worked on by @srh).\r\nThat fact makes it difficult to tell whether #1971 actually improved anything about this issue or not. For technical reasons, I cannot easily test the #1971 change with the old cache.\r\n\r\nHave to wait until the regression in the cache is fixed, and then test this again..."
