      "@wojons: Thanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\nFor people interested in details: Backfilling uses `rdb_erase_range()` very frequently to erase small ranges of keys.\r\n`rdb_erase_range()` apparently was written with deletions of a lot of values in mind (like deleting a whole shard). Thus each call to it does a complete traversal of each sindex tree. Hence quadratic runtime of a backfill in the number of documents.\r\n\r\nWe clearly have to change that. Probably we shouldn't use the same erase range operation for backfill erases and shard erases."
