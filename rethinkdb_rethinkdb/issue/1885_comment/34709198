      "I'm a little baffled by the behaviour though. Initially, we saw it sync about 60k blocks in about an hour, then 24h later, it was only done about 70k, and after that, it seemed to only completely about 1k per day or less. Looking at the disk IO, the machine which was doing the syncing was still doing a very high rate of IO to disk, it just didn't seem to be making any progress on actually completing the sync. We're at the point now where new data is being pushed into the table faster than it's syncing to the secondary machine, so it's likely impossible for it to ever complete.\r\n"
