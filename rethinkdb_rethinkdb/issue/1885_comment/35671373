      "I'm now able to reproduce the disk reads on the receiving node. It just required a larger table to kick in.\r\nThe reads are caused by our garbage collector. With the patch from #1971, the GC decreased the backfilling throughput by about 20-30%. While garbage collection is set up to have as little impact on queries as possible, backfilling is considered a background task, so the impact is a little higher here.\r\nI yet have to test the impact of garbage collection without #1971.
