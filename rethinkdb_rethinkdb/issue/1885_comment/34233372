      "Talked with @neumino on IRC, this problem has re-occured even after blowing away and re-creating the table on the secondary system. Doing this boosted sync speed initially, but after letting it run overnight, it's mostly stalled again, only doing ~1 msg/sec, even though the syncing machine is still doing ~20MB/s in ~2000 writes/sec.\r\n\r\nSo something about the sync workload is working extremely hard, but making almost 0 progress.\r\n"
