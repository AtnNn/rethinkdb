      "I'm upgraded to 1.12.4 now, just recreating the secondary index on my big table. It's going at about 800 writes/s (as reported by the web interface), which I estimate will take about 39h to complete, so that aspect seems only marginally faster. I'll move on to testing the resync performance once that's done."
