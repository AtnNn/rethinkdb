      "A good chunk of the table in question should be able to fit in RAM on these boxes, but isn't currently because we're not using --no-direct-io. In lieu of any other fixes, it'd probably help us immensely to see  #1892 fixed so that we can properly deploy with --no-direct-io without hacking the init scripts or anything else messy."
