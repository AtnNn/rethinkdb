      "Unfortunately, after leaving the replication running over the weekend, it's now dropped to a very unstable rate of 50-450 writes/s (centered around 250/s) and is behaving very erratically. After 3 days, it has only completed 747340/2730617 blocks.  So, it doesn't appear like this problem is resolved in the latest 1.12 releases."
