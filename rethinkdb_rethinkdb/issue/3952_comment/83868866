      "I wonder if evaluating the `map` in parallel would increase the throughput for this query (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2156).\r\n\r\nGenerally I think optimizing queries like this is worthwhile because the same optimizations will likely speed up all sorts of joins.\r\nWe should probably tackle this soon after 2.1."
