      "> Secondarily, I've found `.count()`s to be extremely slow compared to actually returning the results... worth a shot removing the count entirely.\r\n\r\nThat might happen if not all results of the query are retrieved. In that case only the first few results of the query without `count` will be generated by the server, until more results are requested by the client. Could this be the case?\r\nI would be very surprised if loading all results of a query was faster than running the same query with `count`."
