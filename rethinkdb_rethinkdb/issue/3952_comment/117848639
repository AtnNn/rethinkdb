      "@PrakashThapa -- RethinkDB streams data to the clients, so you'll get a cursor back as soon as the first batch of data is available in the `filter` case, but the `count` case doesn't return until the entire stream is consumed.  I would guess that if you wrote `r.db(\"dbname\").table(\"tablename\").filter(function(f){return f(\"price\").default(0).gt(40)}).coerce_to('array')` to force the entire stream to be read before anything is returned to the client that the performance would be worse than the `count` performance."
