      "Thanks for the update @mike-marcacci . Sorry you had to deal with this.\r\n\r\nI'm still not quite sure why it would backfill so much. A brief backfilling period is normal, but unless the write load is extremely high, it should only take a few seconds.\r\n\r\nIt's also weird that the table went into outdated reads only. Usually the table configuration logic should ensure that it only switches primaries when it can ensure that the table remains ready for at least most of the time. There's a chance that we just don't display the status correctly in some scenarios and the table was actually available for most of the time, though I'm not too sure about that. \r\n\r\nAs for debugging: If you haven't replaced shard 3 yet, a copy of the outputs of `r.db('rethinkdb').table('_debug_table_status')` and `r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_config')` might be helpful. If you can save those in a file and email them to me (daniel@rethinkdb.com) we'll have some details at least to look at."
