        "A few mistakes:\n- The r['attr'] syntax doesn't work like shown in the examples, e.g. `r.table('users').filter(r['age'] > 5).run()` doesn't work. iirc this was the original motivation behind having R and imports like \n\n``` python\nimport rethinkdb as r\nfrom rethinkdb import R\n```\n\nor the alternative hacky module wrapper.\n- There's scattered uses of `orderBy` instead of `order_by`, \n- the grouped_map_reduce example has unbalanced parens on r.branch.\n- && and || should be & and |\n- some examples use `let_var` instead of `letvar`\n"
