This causes problems when the hostname resolves to the addresses of multiple peers.\r\n\r\n@dminkovsky noticed this behaviour:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ host cluster.example.com\r\ncluster.example.com has address 10.0.0.1\r\ncluster.example.com has address 10.0.0.2\r\ncluster.example.com has address 10.0.0.3\r\n$ host $HOSTNAME\r\ninstance-2 has address 10.0.0.2\r\n$ rethinkdb --join cluster.example.com --bind all\r\nwarn: Attempted to join self, peer ignored\r\ninfo: Attempting connection to 0 peers...\r\ninfo: Listening on addresses: 127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nA possible workaround using bash is\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rethinkdb --bind all $(printf -- '--join %s ' $(dig +short A cluster.example.com))\r\n```\r\n\r\nA built-in option for this might be useful. Perhaps `--join-all`."
