      "The fix has been approved and merged to `next` in commit 17769fc, and cherry-picked into `v2.1.x` in commit b161f2d.  Will be in release 2.1.2.\r\n\r\nThe change was actually a TODO for the raft update to have the `outdated_index_issue_tracker_t` operate on the raft state rather than the table's sindex configuration in the data file's btree.  This has the advantage of being much more accurate about the current state of indexes, as well as removing a lot of ugly code."
