      "I like the idea, and I think it can be done with a bit of refactoring in our code.\r\nI think we should keep our current behavior as the default (to stay with the philosophy of a schemaless DB), but allow strict index behavior to be enabled via an option as you say.\r\n\r\nI think validators are a bit separate, as they aren't really related to indexes per se. (also note that https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5813 which is going to ship with 2.4 allows you to implement validators)"
