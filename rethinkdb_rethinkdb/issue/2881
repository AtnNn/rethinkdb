        "We should write tests that exercise all the features of the ReQL admin API and make sure they behave as expected. Here's an incomplete preliminary list:\n- ~~`r.table_reconfigure()` with the `dry_run=True` flag and many different settings, to make sure it comes up with reasonable configurations.~~ I did this when I implemented `table.reconfigure()`\n- ~~`r.table_reconfigure()` at least once with `dry_run=False`, to make sure it actually commits the configuration as expected. Confirm that the return value of `r.table_reconfigure()` matches what it wrote to `rethinkdb.table_config`.~~ I did this when I implemented `table.reconfigure()`\n- ~~`r.table_elect_directors()` in all its forms (manually specified directors, automatic choice in various scenarios)~~ We got rid of `r.table_elect_directors()`; see #2858.\n- All the pseudo-tables\n"
