        "When running RethinkDB on our EC2 instance, memory use increases over time. This occurs on every machine. Our usage is very simple, we store a number of JSON documents that are used to generate content pages which are served via HTML.\r\n\r\nWe utilize both browser and NGINX caching, so the actual hits to the underly rethinkdb on a per request basis are (in theory) minimal.\r\n\r\nHere is an image that shows the memory increase, and the effect of restarting rethink.\r\n\r\n![2015-08-11 at 11 33 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/278048/9206810/dbf8b1b6-401e-11e5-8378-478b6df9e312.png)\r\n\r\nOutput of the db status call: https://gist.github.com/balasuar/cb555b4a1cac865e2a4e\r\n\r\nFor completeness sake, here is the code that interfaces with rethinkdb:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/balasuar/5ee27d7a6e0de8914fe2\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nrethinkdb 2.0.4~0trusty (GCC 4.8.2)\r\nLinux ip-XXXX-generic #63-Ubuntu SMP Wed Sep 3 21:30:07 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\nEC2 t2.medium instance\r\n4 gb ram\r\nrethink dash: 1.16.4\r\n```"
