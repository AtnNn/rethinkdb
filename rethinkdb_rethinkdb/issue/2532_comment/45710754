      "Given that the error happens both in the client and the server, I think it's likely something's going on with your code. If I'm not mistaken, it looks like you're opening a new connection every time you try to find a user, and then the connection never gets closed (until it times out). Is that right?\r\n\r\nIf it's the case, I'd suggest two improvements:\r\n\r\n- Close every connection immediately after you're done with it (see http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/#close)\r\n- Less important, but when does `User.findById` get called? For example, if you call it multiple times per http request, I'd open a connection per request and then reuse that connection for multiple calls, instead of doing a connection per call.\r\n\r\nLet us know if this helps!"
