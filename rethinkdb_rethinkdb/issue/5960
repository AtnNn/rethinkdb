        "For some deployments having a single replica (possibly in non-voting mode) designated for backup purposes. But currently even if you connect to that replica with the `dump` or `export` commands, the actual data will still come from the Primary for that replica. This defeats the purpose of having the \"backup node\".\n\nIf we add an option to read from the replica in `outdated` mode, then as long as that server has that shard it will read from it locally, allowing (when properly setup) for the single mode to handle all of the traffic, sparing the Primaries.\n\nThis should be an easy change, and I will add it next week.\n"
