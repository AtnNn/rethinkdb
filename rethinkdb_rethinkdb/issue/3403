        "Profiling indicates that using `poll` on OS X makes some queries *a lot* slower (e.g. 10-20x slower `count()` queries compared to Linux, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3380#issuecomment-65508791 ). On Linux we use `epoll`, which is exclusive to Linux unfortunately. On OS X there is `kqueue`/`kevent` which should be similarly efficient.\r\n\r\nWe probably have to add an event queue implementation using `kqueue` (compare the poll/epoll implementations in `src/arch/runtime/event_queue`). Or we could consider using a library such as libevent http://libevent.org/ ."
