      "@wojons -- yep, that's the one you e-mailed me about (I went through your e-mail and opened issues for some of the items you brought up).\r\n\r\nI don't know that we want to do autotiming. I'd start with just implementing the command in RethinkDB -- if you want to time it you can do it with cron or some such quite easily. We can then see how that works and may be timing windows in RethinkDB itself. Baby steps :)\r\n\r\n> Currently, I've been doing evil/unclean things using https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/test/common/http_admin.py#L484\r\n\r\n@kamilion -- that's not actually that evil, that's how the web UI currently operates. The interface is just undocumented though, but we'll make it better, document it, and possibly allow decommissioning the machine nicely in case you want a \"soft\" landing.\r\n\r\nWe're planning to start heavy development/enhancements on clustering around June, FYI."
