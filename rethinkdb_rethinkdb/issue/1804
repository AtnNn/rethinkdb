The commands exit with \"done (0 seconds)\" and it feels like nothing happened.\n\nThey should print exactly how many rows were imported/exported at the end of the command (e.g. \"Done (0 seconds, X documents imported)\")\n\nI could have sworn there was an issue for this, but I can't find it. @Tryneus -- please let me know if there is another issue tracking this.\n"
