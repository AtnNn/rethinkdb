      "I answered on StackOverflow yesterday, but forgot to also include my answer here:\r\n\r\n1. Rather than trying to fight `homebrew` to change the configuration file location, use their `launchd` plist (soft-linking to it from either from `~/Library/LaunchAgents` as they advise, or from `/Library/LaunchDaemons`), and make the config modifications you want in the file at the location they choose (defaults to `/usr/local/etc/rethinkdb.conf` assuming you have not change the `homebrew` location). From my limited testing it does not seem that they do anything to modify this file on upgrades.\r\n\r\n2. Don't use `homebrew`'s launchd plist, but rather modify our example one to point at the binary created by `homebrew`. This does put you in the odd situation of running a user-owned binary from a root-owned launchd item, but if you are already using `homebrew`, then you are already in similar waters.\r\n\r\nIf it was me, I would skip homebrew altogether, and just use the .pkg available on the website (full disclosure: I work on that .pkg). The docs that you linked to include how to setup a launchd plist for that, and since the .pkg does not include that, you don't have to worry about that messing with your configuration. It has the nice benefit of making you as close to our tested version as possible (and I mean to make it exactly our tested version at some point)."
