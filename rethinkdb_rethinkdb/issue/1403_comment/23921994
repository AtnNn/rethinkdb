      "Lucid has yajl 1.0.4, and precise has 1.0.8, while newer versions have 2.0.4.  The 1.0.x versions are called \"legacy\" versions on the github page, and I think the API changed slightly at some point: https://github.com/lloyd/yajl/commit/b78dd790825e3347422ef8ac56d2ad557a473e8f .\r\n\r\nI would prefer to put this in our source tree, since:\r\n* It's small and easy to compile.\r\n* We won't have to deal with multiple versions in the wild.\r\n* We may well have to make small patches like with cJSON.  (I hope we don't, but it never hurts to be prepared.)"
