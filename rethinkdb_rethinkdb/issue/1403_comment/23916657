      "> why do you have to build your json parser along side your code? why not depend on it and just check for it in your configure pass?\r\n\r\n@atnnn could probably do a better job explaining the rationale, but I think the original reason was that there are platforms that didn't include some libraries as a package. We have to build on different versions of Ubuntu, OS X (via brew, but also via a binary installer), and other such issues. Traditionally that meant that there was at least *one* platform that screwed things up, and sometimes it was just easier to include the files into the codebase than dealing with dependency hell."
