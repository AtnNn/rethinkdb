      "So, there are a couple of good alternatives, but yajl (http://lloyd.github.io/yajl/) caught my eye:\r\n* Recommended on StackOverflow (as were a lot of things).\r\n* Has speed as one of its design goals.\r\n* Callback-oriented API, so we can construct and print `datum_t`s directly without going through an intermediate representation.\r\n* Interface looks pretty simple.\r\n* Portable ANSI C that has been compiled on OS X before.\r\n* Multiple stable releases, which suggests a level of resilience."
