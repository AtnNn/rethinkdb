      "So, I fixed both of the performance problems, and cJSON still isn't the fastest thing around.  The snippet Slava has (with 10k elements) takes about .5 seconds to do in RethinkDB on Newton, compared to about .1 seconds for `JSON.parse` in Ruby.\r\n\r\nThis is sub-optimal but acceptable, I think."
