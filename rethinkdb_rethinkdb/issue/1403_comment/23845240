      "I looked at rapidjson, but it seemed too immature.  It doesn't seem to have any documentation except the wiki, which is incomplete, and and there are a lot of concerning bugs open: https://code.google.com/p/rapidjson/issues/list (e.g. https://code.google.com/p/rapidjson/issues/detail?id=68 , or https://code.google.com/p/rapidjson/issues/detail?id=75 , or https://code.google.com/p/rapidjson/issues/detail?id=12 (which is more of a highly questionable design decision than a bug)).\r\n\r\nyajl's issue list seems much more reasonable, and their code looked good.  For instance, this is how they print a double: https://github.com/lloyd/yajl/blob/master/src/yajl_gen.c#L225 .\r\n\r\nWhat seems heavyweight about it?  The API looked pretty clean to me; you just register a callback for every class of token, then it calls those callbacks for you."
