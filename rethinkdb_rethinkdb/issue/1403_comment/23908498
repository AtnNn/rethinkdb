      "why do you have to build your json parser along side your code? why not depend on it and just check for it in your configure pass? debian ubuntu and gentoo have packages for it and someone already mentioned that centos does too ...\r\n\r\nwouldn't removing json library code from your code base be productive? sometimes deleting lines of code has more benefit than adding lines."
