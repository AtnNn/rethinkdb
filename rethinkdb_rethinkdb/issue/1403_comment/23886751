      "I'd actually prefer to fix this issue rather than replacing cJSON. I really don't want to have a build system that depends on cmake, Ruby or these other packages and I agree with @srh that starting from scratch is very likely to create new bugs. If the problem is just that sscanf is scanning the entire length of the string this shouldn't be too hard to fix. I really see a lot of value in having a json parsing library that's 2 files big and thus very easy to modify ourselves."
