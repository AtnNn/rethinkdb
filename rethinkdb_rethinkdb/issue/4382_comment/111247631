      "Sorry you ran into this. This is actually just a case of pretty confusing syntax on our end.\r\n\r\n`r.wait()` doesn't wait for all tables, but it waits for all tables in the default database. It works analogously to other operations such as `r.tableCreate()` or `r.table()`, all of which use the default database if no `r.db(...)` is prefixed.\r\n\r\nSo you'll probably need to run `wait()` on the specific database that you're using, or do something like\r\n```js\r\nr.dbList().filter(r.row.ne('rethinkdb')).forEach(r.db(r.row).wait().do(...))\r\n```\r\nto wait (and run your deletion function) on all tables in all databases."
