      "That error's produced by the server, and the server has no idea whether the query is coming from a language that uses prefix notation or a language that uses infix notation.  (That is, it doesn't know whether the user typed `r.reduce([], func)` or `r([]).reduce(func)`).  So the server uses the most generic language possible, and counts every argument to the function as an argument.\r\n\r\nIf JS doesn't do that, it may be because it's doing argument-checking on reduce in the driver instead."
