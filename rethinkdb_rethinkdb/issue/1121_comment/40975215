      "Question about backtraces in Ruby. Do we expect people to use a prefix notation everywhere?\r\n\r\n```\r\nRethinkDB::RqlCompileError: Expected 2 argument(s) but found 1.\r\nBacktrace:\r\nr([]).reduce\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found that quite disturbing -- but that may be because I'm used to JavaScript backtraces.\r\n\r\nAlso on a side note (and less important note?), it would be nice to report the name of the function that failed to compile (in all drivers)."
