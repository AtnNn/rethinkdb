      "Curious. I actually remember fixing this bug a few weeks ago and it certainly works when I test it in node. Sounds like the problem lies in differences between node and the browser environments or in how we integrate the JS driver into the data explorer. Unfortunately this potentially makes the problem a lot harder to diagnose."
