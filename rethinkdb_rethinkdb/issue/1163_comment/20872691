      "@HorizonNet -- thanks for bringing this up and sorry for the delay. For now we tell users to set up a reverse proxy in front of RethinkDB web UI for authentication (we'll post a document on how to do it soon). I agree this isn't an ideal solution since it requires users to configure another server like nginx.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why we haven't baked authentication into RethinkDB itself yet:\r\n\r\n* The RethinkDB web server would have to take special care to be secure, which is often error prone and requires significant time and peer review\r\n* If we add basic authentication, the next step is to add ssl support, which is a road we don't really want to get on\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'll talk to some folks here about it and see what we can do. There might be a creative solution we can adopt, or we might have to bite the bullet and just do the whole shebang at some point."
