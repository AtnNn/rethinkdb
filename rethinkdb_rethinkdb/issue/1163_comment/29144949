      "@Rnhmjoj sorry for the delay.\r\n\r\nI just tried the configuration with apache 2.2.25-1, it works fine for me.\r\nDoes `http://localhost:8080` works for you?\r\n\r\nThe reverse proxy should forward everything, so if it can find index.html, it should also find the cluster.css fle.\r\n\r\n`/Users/<user>/Sites` is the default virtual host used on OSX when you install apache.\r\nCould you deactivate this virtualhost?\r\n\r\nThe strange thing, is that localhost/rethinkdb_admin/ shouldn't try to reach localhost/cluster.css (I just checked, the path are relative, not absolute in index.html). Which lead to this question: What version of RethinkDB are you running?"
