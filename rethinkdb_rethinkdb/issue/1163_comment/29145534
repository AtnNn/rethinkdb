      "Hum, that's really strange.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that I think of is: there is a virtualhost that matches `http://localhost/rethinkdb_admin/cluster.css?v=1.10.1` before the proxy pass.\r\n\r\nCan you disable all the virtualhost (with `a2dissite` or by removing the symbolic link in `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` except the one described here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1163#issuecomment-20899267\r\nAnd make sure that there is no other virtualhost except the one with the proxy pass.\r\nMake sure that there is no DocumentRoot in the virtualhost that contains the proxy pass.\r\n\r\nIf that still doesn't work, I really have no idea what's happening there.\r\nI would like to run more tests, but I don't have an OS X machine available here :( and it works fine on my linux."
