      "Instruments' allocation profiler doesn't show anything that's using the memory. It shows the amount of allocated memory at a reasonable level, while at the same time the rethinkdb process is using much more memory in reality. This looks to be something on the system / allocator level, but I'm not sure what it is.\r\nI also have no theory yet as to why it looks to be working ok with RethinkDB 2.1 / `next`."
