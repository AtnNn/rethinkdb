      "Moving to `2.0.x`. This isn't critical for 2.1 because for some odd reason `next` doesn't appear to be affected by this.\r\n\r\nIt is kind of scary though that this can happen, and I think we should do https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2230 soon to avoid potential bugs in the older compiler (if this is indeed a compiler bug)."
