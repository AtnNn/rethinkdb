      "@coffeemug i know ever user may use rethinkdb differently from your original vision. I use it for a database but also as an anyaltics engine/framework. As we all know PHP is not the language to handle large data processing which is why PHP was able to handle its own when paired with MySQL because you have MySQL handle all that data processing for you. With all the new ways the web works and terms like \"webscale\" it makes mysql a less popular thing to scale your php with. I personally install rethinkdb on all my application nodes in my cluster and have them connect locally. I even processing that is not built into the php framework to the local database to processes it for me sometimes that is going out to another server where the data is sometimes using it to sanitize a users input using things like\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.json().map()\r\n```"
