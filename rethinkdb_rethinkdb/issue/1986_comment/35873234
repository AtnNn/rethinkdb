      "@coffeemug from what i understand from @danielmewes is that using coerceTo('array') will remove all parrllelizion. and the entire data set will have to fit into memory and i am not sure if that also means it messes up with pipelining so if its a large data setit needs to be pulled into one array first before it continues processing on the parent node. it can get the same results i want from above depending on the data set size and other stuff but not as flexible as what i am purposing.
