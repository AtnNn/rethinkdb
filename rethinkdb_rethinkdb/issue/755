        "Our custom coroutine stacks appear to confuse the only two good working heap profiling tools available (valgrind massif and OS instruments -- which, btw, are incredible). I propose the following reasonably simple solution which should get us enormous bang for the buck as far as memory profiling is concerned.\r\n\r\nImplement the coro API on top of threads in the following way. Every time we call the API to spawn a coroutine, spawn a native thread instead. However, on any given CPU core, make sure only one of these \"coroutine\" threads runs at a time via a lock. To switch to a different coroutine/thread, the original coroutine would have to yield (and unlock the lock so another coroutine could lock it).\r\n\r\nThis will allow rethink to run as it does now, but with proper stacks so we can actually run memory profiling tools. I can take a crack at it, but @srh could probably do it quicker and more efficiently than I can."
