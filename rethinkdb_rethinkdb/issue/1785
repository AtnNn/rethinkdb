        "1) From the [Ruby example](http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/dates-and-times/), \"r.epoch_time creates a UTC time (it doesn't know or care what time zone the client is in)\". \r\n\r\nSo, using `r.now()` when inserting a new document yielded:\r\n\r\n    [ { id: '71b4a41b-19b2-48ef-bce5-a5ba3da1d8bb',\r\n        message: 'test',\r\n        timestamp: Tue Dec 17 2013 12:53:54 GMT-0700 (MST) } ]\r\n\r\nWhich I _would understand_, but using `r.epochTime(new Date().getTime() / 1000)` when inserting a new document yielded:\r\n\r\n    [ { id: 'cb84e385-ed3d-4a67-ba2d-71700de5433f',\r\n        message: 'test',\r\n        timestamp: Tue Dec 17 2013 12:53:34 GMT-0700 (MST) } ]\r\n\r\n**So, why is the document being returned with my timezone when using `r.epochTime`?** I obviously would like to see UTC returned!\r\n\r\n(I would have assumed something like the Javascript version of `{\"timestamp\"=>2013-08-13 23:32:49 +0000}]`)\r\n\r\n2) I initially used `r.epochTime new Date().getTime()`, because it's kind of the \"Javascript\" way to use milliseconds. Seems like that could be added? \r\n\r\nThanks!"
