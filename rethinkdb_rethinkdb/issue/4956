        "It would be nice to have the option of uneven sharding between nodes. The most simple example would be sharding based on the disk size. For example if I have been deploying 10TB nodes and I decide to upgrade that to 20TB I might want those nodes to store twice as much data.\r\n\r\nOf course there are other considerations which might complicate the process but for machines of different sizes it is obvious why you would want this. If each node could be assigned a weight the sharding algorithm could use that to pick better shard sizes."
