      "I thought about this a lot and talked to @mglukhovsky, and I'm actually really split on this. There are a number of good reasons not to post these docs:\r\n\r\n1. Maintaining these and the api page and making them both excellent is double the work. I don't feel comfortable posting half-baked autogen docs.\r\n2. It will be unclear to people which docs they should use, especially if they're not consistent.\r\n3. It will be tempting not to make the api page as good as it possibly can be (and it can be *much* better than now) if the generated docs are out.\r\n4. It would complicate site deployment process.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to hold off on this until we push out the next two revisions of the api page. If people still want autogenerated docs, let's revisit this then."
