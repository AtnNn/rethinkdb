      "I still think the autogen docs are, by their nature, more detailed and much more useful in some situations, but I trust your judgement if you think leaving them off right now is a major usability win.\r\n\r\n(Also, as an aside, I don't think the deployment process would have to be that painful.  We already have make targets for publishing the drivers; we could make publishing also regenerate the docs and then push them to dotcloud or whatever.)"
