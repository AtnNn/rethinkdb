      "I agree with @mlucy that because autogen docs are used for autocompletion and can in fact be viewed on RubyDoc (although I don't think the equivalent is true for packages on PyPi or npm), they should be polished. However, I would prefer to have *one* central place for people to find answers about the API, regardless of what language they're using.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradeoff between docs usability for a novice user (for which rethinkdb.com/api is clearly better, given that it presents info in a task-oriented manner), and users already working with the language and its autocompletion / language-specific tools.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would very strongly prefer to keep the generated docs off rethinkdb.com, as @coffeemug correctly points out that it will immensely complicate both the jekyll build process for the site and splinter focus on which docs are primary sources for users. I would urge us to instead improve the usability of the main docs to compensate for their current shortcomings (e.g. main docs being wrong  / unclear are not a reason to replace them with autogen docs, they're a reason to improve the main docs).\r\n\r\nNote that there are many other projects that use this approach (one set of main docs across languages) and do not provide the autogen docs, and I've never had a strong need to examine the autogen versions."
