        "The [official](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/start-on-startup/) method of configuring the RethinkDB daemon on OS X, when installed with Homebrew, says to modify the corresponding .plist file so that `rethinkdb` is run with the option `--config-file /etc/rethinkdb.conf`.\n\nHowever, the .plist file installed by Homebrew, i.e. ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.rethinkdb.plist, is overwritten upon every upgrade of RethinkDB, so this is not really a viable way of configuring RethinkDB. See also [my question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/34223941/265261) about this problem.\n\nCould you please implement a more viable way of configuring RethinkDB as installed by Homebrew, that persists across upgrades?\n"
