      "@rlancer Yes, but you would also get the result of the query in the same request, so it wouldn't be an additional roundtrip unlike when first running with `.typeOf()`.\r\n\r\nOr do you need to know if a given query returns an object or sequence, and then run a completely different query depending on what the answer is?\r\n\r\nDetermining whether a query is going to return a sequence or not without running it first is not trivial in general, and sometimes not possible. For example consider the query\r\n```js\r\nr.branch(r.random(2).eq(0), r.range(10000), \"str\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis query will return a string in half of the cases, and a sequence in the other half. You can have similar (more realistic) queries where the type depends on the data in a particular table."
