      "I assume by \"both sharding settings\" you mean the number of shards and the number of replicas?\r\n\r\nIf you had three replicas, you should be able to change the table configuration even with one server missing. It's probably a bug if that's not working.\r\n\r\nWhich RethinkDB version are you running?\r\n\r\nCan you try to run the following command in the Data Explorer to reduce the shards manually, and post the result here?\r\n```js\r\nr.db(your db).table(your table).reconfigure({replicas: 1, shards: 1})\r\n```"
