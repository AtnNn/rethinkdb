        "Previously, if you specified UNIT_TESTS=1 during make, the Makefile would add dependencies in both `rethinkdb` and `rethinkdb-unittest` on the `libgtest.so.0` shared-object file.  This is obviously wrong, but in addition, gtest no longer supports installing a shared object file.\n\nThese commits change the build such that gtest is now statically linked, and only for the `rethinkdb-unittest` build.  The normal `rethinkdb` binary now does nothing regarding gtest.\n"
