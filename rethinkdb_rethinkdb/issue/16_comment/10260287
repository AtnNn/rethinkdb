      "So, I might be reading this wrong, but I believe the problem is that right now all the clients hard-code 'id' as the primary key in a few places, including as the key we select on for the right table in an eq_join.\r\n\r\nAt least in the Ruby client, the syntax here is that the first argument is the attribute we're selecting from the *left* table, and then we always use `id` as the attribute of the right table.\r\n\r\nWe should just fix this on the server, so that instead of hardcoding the `id` in the client that part of the protobuf is optional and it's filled in by the server as the primary key of the table.\r\n\r\nA simpler client-only fix would be to reintroduce the optional third argument to `eq_join`, and let users specify the primary key of the right table there.  This would also be forward-compatible when we introduce secondary indexes.  I'll open a separate issue about that."
