      "I'd like to move this into 1.15. We could cut a corner here if absolutely necessary, but in general I think we should respect feature freezes because it's too easy for things to go wrong (even for small commands).\r\n\r\n@gchpaco -- would you mind reverting the commit in 1.14.x branch?\r\n\r\n@wojons -- the issue with getting the command in and letting the drivers handle it later is organizational. It's easy for things to slip through the cracks, for drivers to get out of sync with each other in terms of functionality, missing documentation, etc. Getting everything in at once has drawbacks, but it's generally less painful than letting the drivers lag behind."
