      "We need to write the docs for `r.uuid`, regenerate the `reql_docs.json` file before releasing.\r\nIt may be more reasonable to remove `r.uuid` from `1.14.x` (we could also release without the docs for `r.uuid` I think -- but I'm not sure @AtnNn or @larkost want to do a point release later for that)"
