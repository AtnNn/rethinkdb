      "@wojons -- I think @srh was joking.  We have a class called `uuid_u` internally that I think he was making a reference to.\r\n\r\nAs for why it wasn't done three months ago, the short answer is that there are hundreds of relatively simple issues open, all of which are important to someone.  We close as many as we can each release, but there are still easy ones we just haven't been able to schedule yet.  (We also have to make time to work on large issues, as well.)\r\n\r\n(Also, even commands like this which seem like they should only take a few minutes often end up taking longer.  After you implement them on the server, you have to update the protobuf spec, update all three drivers, write documentation in three languages, write unit tests to make sure e.g. it gets rejected in atomic updates since it's non-deterministic, etc. etc.  It can add up.)"
