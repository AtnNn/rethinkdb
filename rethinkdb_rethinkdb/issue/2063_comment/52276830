      "We can remove `r.uuid` from 1.14.x if the docs absolutely positively can't make it in, but I think @wojons has been waiting on it for a while, so it would be nice if we didn't.  (I realize I'm breaking the rules here because it's the 11th hour and it isn't a bugfix, but it's a very small and self-contained change that won't break anything else.)"
