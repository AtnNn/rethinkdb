      "Ok, I looked at the old issue, and this is equivalent code to the old PR, so I expect that the tests that failed will fail with this PR as well. coffeescript implicitly returns the branches of the if, so it shouldn't affect the output (we checked this on coffeescript.org to verify)\r\n\r\n@mikemintz Which tests were failing before, were you able to replicate the failures with the old code?"
