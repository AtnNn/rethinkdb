      "I agree that the issues you're listing are real problems, but reprinting a query at the end of the results is a really poor solution to those problems. We should discuss how to solve these problems better (in a way that integrates with query history), but printing a long (and poorly formatted) query in results after the user hits \"execute\" isn't the way to go.\r\n"
