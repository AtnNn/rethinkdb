      "> Having multiple versions of ReQL is something we'll have to deal with, like it or not.\r\n\r\nYes, but it isn't a binary thing.  Every difference between two version of ReQL is a code path we aren't testing, or a potential difference between a user's setup and ours when we're trying to reproduce a bug.  Minimizing the number of places where users might be running different code than we are is valuable."
