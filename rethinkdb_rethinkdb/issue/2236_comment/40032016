      "I assume you're talking about the conversation we had in person two weeks ago. The C++ stress client was designed for extremely high throughputs. This was important because RethinkDB 1.0 supported over 1 million QPS on certain workloads, which is high enough that it's easy for the bottleneck to be in the client rather than the server. We designed the C++ stress client carefully to make sure it would be at least as fast as the server. I don't think that would have been possible if we had used Python rather than C++. However, that probably isn't important anymore."
