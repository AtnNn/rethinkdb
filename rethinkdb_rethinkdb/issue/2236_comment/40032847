      "I think we should drop the C++ client because:\r\n\r\n- It was a poorly designed, unmaintainable mess\r\n- The 1M qps use case per client is much less relevant now. If it becomes necessary again, we should rewrite inner loop parts of the Python client in C++ (but I think it will be a long, long time 'till it comes to that)."
