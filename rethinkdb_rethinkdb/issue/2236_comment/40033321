      "The reason I implemented the python stress client was that the C++ client was constantly broken by query language changes and no one was updating it.  The python stress client can currently hit the limits of a single-node machine without too much trouble, and if we need more performance in the future, we can run workloads from multiple machines.\r\n\r\nThe python stress client will actually tell you what percentage of the time it spends in ReQL space, and it is fairly efficient at the moment.  There is room for improvement, but it isn't necessary in our current use cases."
