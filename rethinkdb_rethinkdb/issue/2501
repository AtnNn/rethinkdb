A couple of things are wrong:\r\n\r\n- Chrome console has a couple of errors (starts with `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL`)\r\n- The raw view tab doesn't get selected (presumably because of the exception)\r\n- The output in the raw view is `\"\\n\\n\"` instead of correct output.\r\n\r\nThe raw view seems to work when `r.http` returns a json object, but not a string. For bonus points, try the raw view with `r.http('www.cnn.com')` :smile:\r\n\r\n/cc @neumino "
