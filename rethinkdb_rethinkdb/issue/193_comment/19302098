      "> I think by default this should create a container directory with a timestamp (like `rethinkdb_export_<date/time>`)\r\n\r\nAgreed. Will amend the proposal.\r\n\r\n> Also, how is CSV export going to work in tables without schemas, exactly?\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution I can think of is to require a list of fields from the user when they want to export a table to CSV, and only exporting those fields. I'm not sure how well it plays with the overall gist of the export command (i.e. exporting the whole database by default). I'm still playing around with the API.\r\n\r\n> Also also, what's the signature for import?\r\n\r\nComing up soon."
