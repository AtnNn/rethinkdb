      "This has been a consistently demanded feature. We should probably talk about how to implement this (one option is to drop the current import code, rewrite it in python, and have the rethinkdb executable support a directory of scripts to extend the `rethinkdb [CMD]` syntax). It would allow us to be *much* quicker with shipping auxillary commands like this, and would also help with issues like #189.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely a large extension to the scope of 1.5, but I'm moving to 1.5-nice-to-have in case someone is idle."
