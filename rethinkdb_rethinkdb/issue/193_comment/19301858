      "I think by default this should create a container directory with a timestamp (like `rethinkdb_export_<date/time>`) and put `db1`, `db2` etc. into that.  We don't want to dump a new directory into `.` for every database, and we don't want to clobber previous exports.\r\n\r\nAlso, how is CSV export going to work in tables without schemas, exactly?\r\n\r\nAlso also, what's the signature for import?"
