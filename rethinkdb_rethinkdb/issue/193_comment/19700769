      "Alright, can do.  I'll have you note that the `-i` option for `rethinkdb import` is indeed in the header, seen as `--import`, which is only valid for directory mode.  After I implement these changes, I'll be working on the `--help` printouts a bit, will try to make them as similar to our other `rethinkdb help *` printouts."
