      "I *love* the overall API. I have some feedback on things that are a little confusing/messy.\r\n\r\nThe `import` and `export` commands support multiple tables and databases, but have a single option to specify the fields. I don't see how this can work with multiple tables/databases, since different tables will almost certainly share field names. I think `--fields` only makes sense when it's applies to a *single* table, but in this UI above we apply it to sets of tables/databases. That seems odd to me. I propose only allowing the `--fields` arg when the user exports/imports a single table. If they're running the operation on multiple tables, we just don't allow specifying fields and import/export everything.\r\n\r\nThe `rethinkdb import` has a `-i` option, but it doesn't show up in the header for some reason.\r\n\r\nI think `rethinkdb dump` should support the `--export` arg and `rethinkdb restore` should support the `--import` arg just like import/export commands do. It can be very useful to dump only a single database or even a single table."
