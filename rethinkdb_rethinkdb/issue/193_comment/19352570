      "Selective CSV export (i.e. where the user explicitly specified the fields\r\nto export) is actually really useful. If you search for \"export mongodb to\r\ncsv\", it's a really demanded feature (which they provide).\r\n\r\nMost tools work with CSV, so the range of use cases for the db are\r\nsignificantly limited if you can't easily export to CSV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Jun 12, 2013 at 1:12 PM, Joe Doliner <notifications@github.com>wrote:\r\n\r\n> I actually question CSV format.
