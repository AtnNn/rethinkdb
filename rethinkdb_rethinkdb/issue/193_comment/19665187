      "Alright, just integrated the scripts with the main executable, although a bit of it is placeholder until we figure out the release details.  Also added `rethinkdb dump` and `rethinkdb restore` with the following semantics:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrethinkdb dump --connect HOST:PORT [--auth_key KEY] [-o FILE]\r\n\r\n--connect, -c  the host and client port of a rethinkdb instance\r\n--auth, -a     client authorization key to access the driver port\r\n-o            file to write tar gzip to (defaults to ./rethinkdb_export_DATE_TIME.tar.gz)\r\n```\r\nThis is implemented as a wrapper for rethinkdb export, and will export into a temporary directory, then tar it into the specified file.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrethinkdb restore ARCHIVE --connect HOST:PORT [--auth_key KEY] [--force]\r\n\r\nARCHIVE        the source archive file from rethinkdb dump\r\n--connect, -c    the host and client port of a rethinkdb instance\r\n--auth, -a     client authorization key to access the driver port\r\n--force        flag to continue with restore even if tables already exist\r\n```\r\nThis is implemented as a wrapper for rethinkdb import, and will untar the archive into a temporary directory, then import it into the cluster.\r\n\r\nStill need to make the whole thing a little more user friendly (--helps and such), and take care of some TODOs, then on to review."
