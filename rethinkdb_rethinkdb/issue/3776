        "It appears that on low-memory systems (1 GB or less), spawning the `r.js` workers could potentially cause the system to run out of memory (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3703).\r\nAt least that's the most plausible explanation for that issue at the moment.\r\n\r\nWe should measure memory usage first, and then think of whether it makes sense to apply some limits for `r.js` workers on low-memory systems (1 GB or less). For example we could limit the number of worker processes on such systems, probably as a configuration option."
