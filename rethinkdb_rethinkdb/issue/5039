        "This started happening recently even though we've made no code changes nor made any updates so it is very strange for us.\r\n\r\nEveryday, the database would become almost unresponsive a few times a day, however, the reads would be below 100k/s and writes under 500/s. I've checked the CPU usage on the database servers and those are all below 30%.\r\n\r\nHowever, even running a query using primary key, this is the result I get:\r\n1min 12.98s round-trip time\r\n1min 11.90s server time\r\n1 shard accesses\r\n\r\nIt feels like there's a lock somewhere that is preventing queries from happening. I've checked the logs of the database, but there was nothing recent in there. Is there a way for me to debug this and find out the source of this issue?\r\n\r\nI am using the rethinkdbdash driver, running on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS with RethinkDB version 2.1.5+2~0trusty"
