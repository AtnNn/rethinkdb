        "Slava, Bill, Sam and I just talked about this.  Here's what I think we should do about all of these:\n- Adopt `default` with exception semantics.  You write either `query.default(val)` or `query.default {|exc| func_of_exc}`.  I think we should do this because exception semantics are easy to explain and easy to implement (it's a small edit distance from what we have now to these semantics).\n- Rename `contains` to `has_fields`.  Make it polymorhpic, where calling `seq.has_fields(:a, :b)` is equivalent to `seq.filter {|x| x.has_fields(:a, :b)}`.  Our new consistent rule for polymorphism is that terms which return an arbitrary object (like `pluck`) are polymorphic with respect to `map`, and predicates which only return a bool are polymorphic with respect to `filter`.  (I don't think most users will ever explicitly learn this rule, but I would bet it has the right shape for their brains.)\n- `has_fields` will return true if the object has all of the keys passed to it **AND** the value of all those keys is non-null.  It turns out that for real queries this is what you want most of the time.\n- Introduce a new primitive (`has_attributes`, `has_names`, `has_keys`, something like that) which returns true if the object has all of the kys (**without** checking whether the value of those keys is NULL).  We don't have to emphasize this in the documentation, but people need some way to do this.\n---\n\nThis gives two ways to solve the problem people have where they want to write e.g.:\n\n``` ruby\ntbl.filter {|user| user[:age] > 10} # some users don't have `age`!\n```\n\n``` ruby\ntbl.has_fields(:age).filter {|user| user[:age] > 10}\ntbl.filter {|user| user[:age].default(0) > 10}\ntbl.filter {|user| (user[:age] > 10).default(false)}\n```\n"
