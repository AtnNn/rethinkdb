      "According to [the documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683242(v=vs.85).aspx), pressing C-c or closing the console window should call the same handler, but with a different argument (`CTRL_C_EVENT` and `CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT` respectively).\r\n\r\nThe message about `Waiting for initialization` should only display if the thread pool hasn't been initialized yet. Does it appear if the console window is closed after the server becomes ready?"
