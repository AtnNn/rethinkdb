      "I agree that this would be useful. However, there are two problems with implementing this right now:\r\n\r\n1. The number of documents in a table is currently approximated (because for now we don't have constant time count)\r\n2. The approximation command is actually relatively expensive because it walks the upper nodes in the btree.\r\n\r\nI'd like to do this along with #152. Moving to backlog until then."
