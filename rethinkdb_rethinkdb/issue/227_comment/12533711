      "You can do a distribution count with a depth of 0 and it won't touch any of\r\nthe non root Bree nodes so its not expensive. I think the approximation\r\nisn't really a problem in that it would still be useful to to people to\r\nhave that number a bit more accessible. Also this number will become exact\r\nand constant time soon. We could easily have it in for 1.4.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, January 21, 2013, coffeemug wrote:\r\n\r\n> I agree that this would be useful.
