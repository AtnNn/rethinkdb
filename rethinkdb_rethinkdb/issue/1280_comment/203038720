      "@dineyw23 Thanks for working on this first of all.\r\n\r\nI think the message is almost good, but I would set the backticks around each alternative rather than around the whole list:\r\n> Invalid time zone string `-1`. Valid time zone formats are `+-hh:mm`, `+-hhmm` `+-hh` and `z`.\r\n\r\n(except with the single +/- character that you're using)"
