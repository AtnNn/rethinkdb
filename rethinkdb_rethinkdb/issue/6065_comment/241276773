      "Just to be clear, there is already a [third-party driver (gorethink)](https://github.com/dancannon/gorethink) that I know people are using. And the list of generally-up-to-date drivers is kept here: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/\r\n\r\nBut if you are specifically looking for a first-party driver then please elaborate on why the existing third-party driver does not meet you needs. As with any engineering effort, energy spent in one place means we can't spend it in another, so we need to have good justification to consider re-doing work that someone else has already done."
