      "@larkost: `./configure` and `make ` should not build the ruby and python drivers by default because they require extra dependencies that users building rethinkdb may not have. One of my original goals for `--enable-drivers` was that it would also cause configure to check for those extra dependencies, but I don't think I ever got to doing that."
