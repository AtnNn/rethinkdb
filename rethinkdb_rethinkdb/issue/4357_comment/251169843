      "Is there any update to this issue? We had a complete application outage as a result of this. It took us nearly 2 hours to even find the specific issue as everything appeared online. Only when we checked the `stats` table and found errors did we understand that a single specific server was the issue. We restarted it's daemon and it immediately resolved the problem. A failover would have been really crucial in this situation. "
