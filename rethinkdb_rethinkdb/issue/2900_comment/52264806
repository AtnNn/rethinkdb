      "One alternative that came up is that we could replace the `term_t` backtraces with internal integer offsets to a backtrace context structure constructed and maintained at the query parser level.  This has the upside of massively reducing the network traffic and associated consing, but has the downside that the `term_t` backtraces are now meaningless outside of a very specific context.  @mlucy and @timmaxw think this tradeoff is worth it if we can do it right, and I concur."
