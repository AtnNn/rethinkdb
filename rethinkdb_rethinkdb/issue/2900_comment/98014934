      "Was finally able to run a benchmark with data from a user who had issues with performance because of complex documents before.\r\n\r\nInserting those big documents without these changes with a single client does ~7 inserts per second (soft durability). With these changes it reaches 10-11 inserts per second. A significant improvement.\r\n\r\nWith 10 concurrent clients the throughput before was ~47 inserts/s. With improved backtraces it is ~65."
