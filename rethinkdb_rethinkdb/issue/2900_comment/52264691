      "We cannot reconstruct the backtrace at run time (or at least should not) because of rewriting terms; we would prefer that the user see a backtrace that had some direct correspondence with what they actually wrote.  This would become far more significant if we did more rewriting (like had a query optimizer or the like), in which case I personally would want to see both the query I submitted and the query the database executed.  But to get to that point the `term_t` implementation would have to change significantly.\r\n\r\n(I should note that this came up in conversation with @mlucy and @timmaxw)"
