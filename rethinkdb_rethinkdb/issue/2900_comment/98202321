      "@coffeemug About 1 MB. Actually it turns out that the insert speed with a single client is bound by the driver. Even at 10 clients, each Python instance is using 99-100% of their core, while the RethinkDB server uses about 700% overall.\r\nI'm not sure why the speedup for 10 clients isn't exactly 10x compared to a single one, but it might be because of hyperthreading making each logical core slower when the other one on the same physical core is also utilized."
