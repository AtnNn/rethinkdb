      "If we are going to make `.run()` optional then I'd like to suggest changing the text on the button from `execute` to `run` just because it enforces the meaning of `run` in the rdb language.\r\n\r\nI talked about this with @coffeemug and floated the idea of actually having the button say `.run()` on it. We both though that was a bit overdone but I think there might be some sort of way for the UI to express to users \"Clicking this button is a similar concept to calling `.run()` on a query in your language.\" UI guys and ideas on how to do this?"
