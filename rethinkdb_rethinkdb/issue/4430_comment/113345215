      "Thank you for the bug report @hwestbrook .\r\nThis doesn't look like a typical out of memory problem.\r\nDoes this happen every time you run the query or only intermittently?\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, I believe that the way we use the profiler in `rdb_batched_replace` is wrong. We spawn multiple concurrent tasks that all add to the same profiler event log. This causes `sampler_t::new_sample()` to crash if one of the other parallel coroutines is in the middle of a profiled task."
