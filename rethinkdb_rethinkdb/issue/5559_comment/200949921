      "@ankit92agrawal Using a tunnel to port 8080 is usually the easiest option and should work. You can also check out http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/security/ , which describes how to set up a reverse proxy for this.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple options for querying from the terminal. You can use `python` with the RethinkDB Python driver, or if you prefer JavaScript syntax, you can use one of the third-party CLI tools that are listed here http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/third-party-admin-tools/"
