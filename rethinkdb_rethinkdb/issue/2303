Convert the award amount from string to number (there were some that needed trimming with split but the result is ~120k records all with numeric `amount` fields.)\r\n``` javascript\r\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"BigLottery\").update({ amount: r.row(\"CURRENT_AWARD\").coerceTo(\"number\") })\r\n```\r\nI think I should be able to sort them by the resulting numeric field, but I can't:\r\n``` javascript\r\nRqlRuntimeError: Array over size limit 100000. in: r.db(\"test\").table(\"BigLottery\").orderBy(\"amount\")\r\n```\r\nIt's a show stopper for analysing open data. \r\nIs there a way to sort this dataset that isn't constrained by the array size limit?"
