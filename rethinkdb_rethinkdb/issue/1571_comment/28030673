      "This is a very minor tweak but having thought about it a bit I think it's cleaner to push this information down into the Datum message by adding a new type `R_JSON` and an optional string we parse as JSON. This just seems like a slightly better abstraction considering we have 2 Datum fields now in the Responses. The second being the profile. And This saves us from having the response look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    repeated Datum response;\r\n    repeated String json_response;\r\n    optional Datum profile;\r\n    optional String json_profile;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously we don't actually have to send the profile back as json but this seems to suggest to me it's a cleaner abstraction."
