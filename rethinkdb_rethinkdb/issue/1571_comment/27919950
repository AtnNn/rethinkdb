      "@neumino -- we have a lot of third party drivers now, and the people maintaining them sometimes (quite reasonably) take a while to update their driver.  If we only sent back JSON, some people using third-party drivers would have to wait weeks or months to switch to the new RethinkDB version, and there are a lot of important bugfixes we want to get to them.\r\n\r\nIt's only a few lines of code in the server to branch on this value and send back either JSON or protobuf responses, so I think we should definitely do that.  We may at some point in the future (maybe after the LTS release) want to deprecate protobuf responses if nobody is using them."
