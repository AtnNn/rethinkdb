      "It smells kind of funny to me to just return an `R_STR` and have them interpret it was json. I think it's nice to be able  evaluate the response protocol buffer without having to remember if you passed `json_response`.\r\n\r\nI'd also prefer to always have the protocol buffer representation as an option. It just seems like once we have both there's really going to be almost no cost to maintaining it. And it feels just a tad more future proof.\r\n\r\nAlso yes it is that simple @neumino but that doesn't mean 3rd party developers are going to do it immediately. Driver development isn't their full time job and it tends to take 3 weeks for them to make any updates. During that time users of the driver can't use the new release which leads to frustration they'll feel toward RethinkDB in general."
