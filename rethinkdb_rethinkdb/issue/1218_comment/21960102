      "Approved and merged into next in commit 46a6b2d and 11c800c, will be in release 1.8.  In addition to the title of this issue, also moved js function caching into the `js_runner_t` itself, as storing it in the protocol layer was awkward and prone to bugs.  `js_id_t`s are not used anymore by the protocol layer, and functions are just called with their source string (which will be converted to a `js_id_t` in the `js_runner_t`)."
