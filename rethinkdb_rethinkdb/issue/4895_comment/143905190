      "The `ResponseType` type seems to be an enum, and it doesn't have any negative values. So I guess it depends on the compiler whether it uses a signed or unsigned type to represent it.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus Do you remember why you are guaranteeing that it's not `-1`? Under which circumstances would a `-1` show up here?"
