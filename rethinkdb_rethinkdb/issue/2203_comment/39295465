      "Please see #2207 for some inspiration and background on the behaviors of Ruby and Python.\r\n\r\nI took a quick dumb look at cJSON.  cJSON seems to have code that handles surrogate pairs when they arrive \"\\u...\" escaped, but not when they arrive in pure UTF-8, combining them into a single Unicode character (represented in UTF-8), when *parsing* JSON.  Then when *emitting* JSON, it seems to send that character as a single UTF-8 group instead of splitting it up into a surrogate pair.  I say this only reading the code, not running it."
