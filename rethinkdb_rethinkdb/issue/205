        "As promised, I cleaned up the tests for the Ruby driver a little bit.\r\n\r\nThe cleanup does change how tests execute:\r\n\r\n* Tables are truncated and repopulated before each test\r\n* Randomly-named dbs/tables are deleted after test\r\n* Tests are expected to be executed through `test.rb` and not individual files\r\n* No more \"Welcome_rdb\" table\r\n* Tests should be independent. The tests in `test_det.rb` were so dependent I just merged them into a single test until future untangling\r\n\r\nClean up included:\r\n\r\n* Moving duplicated code into a helper module\r\n* Moving nested methods into a helper module\r\n* Reformatting code via Ruby2Ruby, which made most code better but some arguably uglier\r\n* Swapping `assert_equal` argument order for correct failure messages (automated, so if any were already correct they are now wrong)\r\n* Removing global variables\r\n\r\nBad news: tests are now considerably slower, likely due to the deleting/populating of tables."
