      "Cool. I'll have a PR with the name removals up a bit later tonight. (I'll have the CLA signed by then.)\r\n\r\nRegarding the issue of #236 in general, I think the big thing is having a way to resolve name conflicts besides having the administrator manually rename one of the machines. I don't know exactly what machine names are used for now, so there might be issues with renaming automatically as soon as a conflict is found. (Especially if two machines booting with the same name can legitimately happen, and would be a bad thing.)\r\n\r\nMaybe the \"name\" could be split in two - the static part (defaulting to hostname) and the dynamic part (a Greek letter or something). So, like, `tantive4-kappa`. If a name conflict is detected, one of them (the one with a higher UUID) picks a new dynamic part, but keeps the static part. (So if two machines on `tantive4` both pick `kappa`, one of them might change to `tantive4-iota`.)"
