      "@AtnNn: All right. Names I'd definitely recommend removing:\r\n\r\n* Abaddon (mythological figure who kills lots of people)\r\n* Antimage (occult)\r\n* Axe (violent)\r\n* Broodmother (kind of creepy)\r\n* Darkseer (occult)\r\n* Darkterror (occult)\r\n* Disruptor (probably not what we want the software to do)\r\n* Doombringer (occult + probably not what we want the software to do)\r\n* Lich (occult)\r\n* Necrolyte (occult + kind of creepy)\r\n* Nightstalker (creepy and potentially triggering)\r\n* Shadowdemon (super occult)\r\n* Sniper (violent)\r\n* Spiritbreaker (occult + violent)\r\n* Timbersaw (violent)\r\n* Troll (probably not what we want the users to do)\r\n* Vengeful (probably not what we want the users to be)\r\n* Venomancer (occult + kind of creepy)\r\n* Warlock (occult)\r\n* Witchdoctor (super occult)\r\n* Zeus (mythological figure who kills lots of people)\r\n\r\nThere are a bunch of proper names for DotA characters whose origins I'm uncertain of, but I don't see anything obviously wrong with any of them.\r\n\r\nThis is only 21 removed names, and it leaves 84 of the existing names. If the goal is just to have a name that's probably unique within a cluster, 84 should still be plenty, so we may not need to add any more. And if we do, there seem to be names on http://www.dota2.com/heroes/ that aren't already in the list, to keep with the DotA theme. Though I don't know what the team's opinions of DotA 2 are ;-)"
