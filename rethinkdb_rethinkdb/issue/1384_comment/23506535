      "@jprichardson Thanks for reporting this-- as @neumino said, we're planning on moving the docs to a new repo that anyone can issue a pull request on (I personally cannot wait to get this done!)\r\n\r\nThere is also an ongoing effort to improve and expand the documentation. I'll ping you when the docs repo is live in case you'd like to suggest other changes (contributions are always welcome!)"
