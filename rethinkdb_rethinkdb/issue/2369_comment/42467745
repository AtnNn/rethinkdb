      "You could do it now by tacking on `.nth(0)` at the end of the filter. I think that's better than adding a specialized operation. There was a bug where `nth` didn't return a proper selection, but that was recently fixed and will be in the next 1.13 release (see #348 for details).\r\n\r\nHope this helps!"
