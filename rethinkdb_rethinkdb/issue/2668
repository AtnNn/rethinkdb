        "Apparently http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash is a common encoding for points.\n\n@neumino suggested adding functionality to support it natively in ReQL.\nActually a given geo hash value defines a \"grid cell\" on the earth's surface, specifically a certain range of longitude and latitude values.\n\nWe could support the following terms:\n- `p.toGeoHash({precision: ...})` converts from a point to a geoHash string with the given precision. I think the precision should be given in terms of the length of the resulting hash.\n- `r.geoHash(hash)` converts a given geoHash string to the polygon described by it\n- `r.geoHash(hash, {center: true})` converts a given geoHash string to the point at the \"center\" of the polygon it describes. We have to define what exactly we mean by \"center\" here (the simplest way would be to take the arithmetic means of the longitude / latitude range pairs encoded in the hash).\n\n(related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2571#issuecomment-48143841 )\n"
