      "Hi @nicksergeant, sorry you ran into this.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB tables are fairly heavy objects, and an empty table has a non-trivial sunk cost in memory. We'll be reducing this cost in the future, but for now 512MB of RAM isn't enough to support a large number of tables).\r\n\r\n/cc @danielmewes -- do you remember precise memory cost for empty tables?"
