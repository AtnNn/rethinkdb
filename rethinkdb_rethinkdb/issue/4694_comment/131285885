      "@VeXocide This is actually slightly tricky, and I'd like to hear your input on it.\r\n\r\nIf you look at `real_reql_cluster_interface_t::sindex_change_internal()`, you can see that we get the table config, then apply the change, and then set the new config.\r\n\r\nThe other place where this might become a problem is when writing to the `table_config` document (let's say you use an `update` query to update one field of the table configuration at a time).\r\n\r\nDo you think it would be reasonable to add a version or UUID to `table_config_and_shards_t`, so that we could detect if the configuration had changed since we last read it?\r\nWe would send the version we're expecting to the Raft leader when setting the new config, and it would return an error if the config no longer matches the current version."
