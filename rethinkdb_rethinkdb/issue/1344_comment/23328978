      "Moving to backlog, since this won't happen until 2.0. This is a really neat idea (@mglukhovsky and I looked at BlinkDB and though, man, it would be cool if Rethink could do that!) But our primary goal now is to have an amazing database for people building realtime applications, not to have an analytics database (though I do realize the lines can get blurry).\r\n\r\nWe'll probably go back to this once we run out of low-hanging fruit."
