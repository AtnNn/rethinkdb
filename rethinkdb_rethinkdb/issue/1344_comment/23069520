      "We don't have a timeout command, but for the error, confidence, you can use the `sample` command.\r\nTo get a constraint (like error 0.1, confidence 0.95), you would have to do a `count` query, compute the good parameter for `sample` and then run your map/reduce.\r\n\r\nUsing it with groupBy is however not possible (or at least I can't think of an efficient way of doing it).\r\n\r\nIt's certainly not as friendly as giving an error and a constraint. I leave @coffeemug chime in for an ETA, but that's probably not going to happen before 2.0 even if it's quite a cool feature."
