        "If stderr/stdout for the `rethinkdb` binary is redirected to a pipe there is an extra line added to every line of output:\n\n```\nPrevious message may not have been written to the log file (cannot flush stderr: Operation not supported).\n```\n\nThere really is not much point to this message, since if we can't flush the handle, then we can't flush it. And printing it to the same file handle seems particularly pointless. So I would say that either we get rid of this message, or at least only emit it once on any file handle.\n\nEven more worrisome is that the server log file does not get anything written to it in this case.\n\nTo reproduce:\n`./rethinkdb 2>&1 | tee /tmp/output`\n\nNote that this will likely require you to kill the underlying `rethnkdb` process, since the server will not respond to control-C entries in this case.\n\nThis came up in #2649, and this bug is to pull this component out of the issue.\n"
