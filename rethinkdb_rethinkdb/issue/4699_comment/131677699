      "`rethinkdb index-rebuild` simply uses `execvp` to execute a python script which rebuilds the indices.\r\nThis script is shipped with the python driver, as seen [here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/_index_rebuild.py). Thus why you need the python driver installed. It is simply more efficient to write administration tools using drivers instead of directly in the source code to keep a clean and maintainable code climate.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to take my word for it ...\r\nFirst look [here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/main.cc#L47), next [here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/administration/main/command_line.cc#L1626-L1627) and [here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/administration/main/command_line.cc#L51) -- these call [this](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/administration/main/command_line.cc#L1590) which was registered [here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next//drivers/python/setup.py#L24).\r\n\r\ntl;dr it's not a bug, its the intended functionality -- install the python driver or migrate manually using [this as a reference](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/_index_rebuild.py) if you are against it."
