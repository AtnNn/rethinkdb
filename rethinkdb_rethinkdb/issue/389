        "When the user gives bad input during rethinkdb process invocation, the output isn't very helpful. Consider:\n\n```\n$ rethinkdb -j 1212\nerror: in option 'join': invalid option value\nPrevious message may not have been written to the log file (cannot open or find log file).\n```\n\nThis should give an actual help string for the --join command that they'd see if they typed `rethinkdb help`. We should also not print the missing logfile warning at the initial stages of the rethinkdb process invocation (e.g. while parsing cli parameters).  Here is another example:\n\n```\n$ rethinkdb http-port foo\nERROR: Unrecognized subcommand ''. Try 'rethinkdb help'.\n```\n\nIn the message for \"unrecognized subcommand\" we should put the word \"foo\" in quotes (it used to work, but doesn't work in my branch).\n\nAssigned to @Tryneus.\n"
