      "`r.db('foo')` is a bit of a special case.  It does return a legal value, it's just not a value we return to users (mostly because we didn't have pseudotypes when we were first implementing ReQL).  So you get back an error, but it's a \"Query result cannot be of type DATABASE\" error -- it wasn't evaluating `r.db(...)` that gave you the error, it was trying to return it to yourself.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'd be up for a proposal to make `r.db(...)`'s return value less confusing."
