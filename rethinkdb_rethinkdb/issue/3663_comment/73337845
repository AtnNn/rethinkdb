      "@timmaxw -- does waiting on a table wait on its indexes?\r\n\r\nWe could add an index pseudotype in place of a binary blob for the return status of `r.table('test').index('a')`.  We could also return the value of `index.status`.  If we returned the value of `index.config`, I think it would be weird for it not to be writable, but I'd be cool with making `.index` a shortcut for `.index.config`.  (And, of course, we could always just return a wrapper object like `{function: BLOB}` instead of `BLOB`.)\r\n\r\nDo any of those four sound palatable?"
