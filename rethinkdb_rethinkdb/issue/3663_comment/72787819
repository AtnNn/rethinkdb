      "I like @mlucy's proposed ReQL interface, it has a pleasing symmetry with the table stuff and the ability to e.g. dupe indexes easily might be helpful.\r\n\r\nThe `wait` issue it seems is a general limitation; what we want is some ability to say, idiomatically, \"I want to wait until all these things are done.\"  Union waiting is easy\8212just issue them in sequence\8212but we may want to make it easier on the user to specify them; maybe `wait` on a sequence type so I could do something like `[r.table(...), r.table(...), r.table(...).index(...), ...].wait()`."
