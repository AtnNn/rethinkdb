      "I'm 100% on board with what @timmaxw wrote.\r\n\r\nI think if we have the `indexes` optarg to `table.wait(indexes = <boolean>)` in addition to being able to call `table.index(...).wait()` we would cover all important cases.\r\n\r\nI'm not generally opposed to supporting wait() on a sequence, though I think it's not very important. Even without it `for_each` can be used I think to implement waiting on multiple things, and it's not that complicated to write in (the probably rare) case where a user needs it.\r\n\r\nIt actually seems like this might become a significant amount of work. Let's keep discussing the proposals, but I might move it over to 2.1 later."
