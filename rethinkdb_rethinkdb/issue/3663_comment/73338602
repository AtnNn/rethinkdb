      "Currently, waiting on a table does not wait on its indexes. But I'm fine with the proposal to support `table.wait(indexes=true|false)`. Probably the default should be `true`.\r\n\r\nI don't think an index pseudo-type is the right way to go. Instead I'd add a new value type (like TABLE) that supports `.wait()`, `.config()`, etc. but that's coercible to a datum, where the datum coercion is equivalent to `.status()`, or perhaps a string of the form `<INDEX 'foo' ON 'bar.baz'>`.\r\n\r\nBut I think @deontologician makes a good point that `r.db(\"foo\")` without anything chained onto it returns a (fairly impenetrable!) error message, and this doesn't seem to have confused anybody."
