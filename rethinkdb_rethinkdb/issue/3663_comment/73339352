      "I'd prefer to make it like DATABASE but improve the error message for returning a DATABASE/INDEX/whatever to the user. One reason is that we might eventually make INDEX do something useful, like return the index values, and if we don't make it coercible to datum then we can do that later without breaking compatibility."
