      "The update syntax here is syntax that we had in 1.2 and I definitely think it should be in 1.4 if it isn't already. I'm not so sure about the replace syntax though it seems like it's not particularly useful since it just gives you a quick way to make every row in the table identical (save for id) but it does give you a really easy way to shoot yourself in the foot since `t.replace({})` now actually deletes all of your data (save for id). What do others think about this syntax?\r\n\r\nAlso as a side note @coffeemug please try to give your issues more descriptive titles. This issue's title should mention the fact that it's about `update` and `replace` not just a generic thing like \"Static value object sugar\""
