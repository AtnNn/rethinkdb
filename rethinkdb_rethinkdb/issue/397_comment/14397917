      "The syntax for update is nice and useful. You can easily update all your document when you update your schema.\r\n\r\nI am a little more skeptical about replace like @jdoliner . I cannot think of a reason why someone will use `.replace` with the syntax sugar (since I guess people don't really want to replace all their documents with the same one)."
