      "In JavaScript `null` and `undefined` are two different things (even though `undefined` can be automatically coerce to `null`), so I would be more in favor or having `r.undefined`.\r\n\r\nFor the rest I completely agree with @nviennot.\r\nIn Chateau, when users are ordering with an index (for big tables), they may be missing a field.\r\nAnd in thinky I didn't add a sugar syntax like `where` that would use an index if available because of `null` and objects.\r\n"
