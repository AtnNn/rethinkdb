      "@neumino -- We allow arrays as secondary index values, and I think we allow objects as well.  The only things that aren't inserted into an index are things that return `null`, a non-datum type, or an error.  (I think.)\r\n\r\nWe've been moving toward treating null as non-existence for a few releases now, because users seem to be using it that way.  If you look at JSON datasets, some have a variable schema, and some have a consistent schema where non-existent values map to `null`.  This means that in practice about half our users have one thing, and half have the other, and we want to make the queries those two groups need to write as similar as possible.  Sometimes we can't do that because the ugliness of doing so is overwhelming, or because we settled on another way of doing it back before we knew what was up and it's too hard to change, but in general we're trying to move in that direction.\r\n\r\nThere's the additional fact that SQL uses `null` to mean non-existence, so a lot of people in the DB world expect that."
