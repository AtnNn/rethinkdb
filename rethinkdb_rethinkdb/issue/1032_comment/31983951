      "I'm a fan of the \"null is just another value\" semantics. I think we should really define what `null` means in ReQL, and implement that behavior consistently. Not decide differently on a case-by-case basis. It might be too late for that by now, but I think it would be so much nicer. Instead we could introduce the special `undefined` (or we might want to call it `absent`) literal in ReQL, which would be generated if a field is missing (in contrast to being set to the value `null`) or if for example the key given to a `table().get()` does not exist."
