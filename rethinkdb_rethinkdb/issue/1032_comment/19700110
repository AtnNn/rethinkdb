      "Having `null` compared with anything return `false` seems like it's going to lead to some really weird behaviors. In particular if `null` compared with anything returns `false` then the negation of any comparison with `null` is `true` which gets really weird. For example there are 2 fairly idiomatic ways to check that a value isn't in a range:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nr.not(20 < val < 30)\r\n# and\r\nval <= 20 | val >= 30\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe weird thing is that if any comparison with `null` returns false then these 2 syntaxes suddenly don't mean the same thing which I think is a really confusing behavior."
