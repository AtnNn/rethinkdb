      "`r.skip` is the name I was originally going to suggest, but I was thinking it might be better to reuse another value like `r.absent` so there aren't so many single-purpose constants hanging around under `r`. It's also intuitive that an \"undefined\" or \"absent\" index value leads to the row not being indexed. (Also, as @thelinuxlich points out, `r.skip` sounds like a name that might be better suited to another purpose down the line.)\r\n\r\n*(Edit: oh yeah, [there already is a `skip` in ReQL](http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/skip/).)*\r\n\r\nAnother possible name: `r.unindexed`"
