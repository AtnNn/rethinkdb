      "Urkh.  I completely forgot about that.  I never really liked that API -- we don't use NULL to implement optional parameters anywhere else.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any good ideas, either for changing `between`s syntax or changing the proposal in this issue?\r\n\r\nOne bad idea I've been kicking around: implementing `r.minval` and `r.maxval`, which would be special values which are never returned to the user but which are respectively less than and greater than every other ReQL value.  (Wait wait wait, read on before you lynch me!)\r\n\r\nThis would solve two problems at once.  `tbl.between(nil, 5)` becomes `tbl.between(r.minval, 5)`.  And compound indexes become much easier to use.  You can write `tbl.between([\"foo\", r.minval], [\"foo\", r.maxval], index:'compound') to get all the values of the compound index where the first field is \"foo\".  (This would, for example, have made https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1227#issuecomment-39369641 much easier for the user in question.)\r\n"
