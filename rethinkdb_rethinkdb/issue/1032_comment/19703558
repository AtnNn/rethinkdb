      "I'm sufficiently confused here that I need clarification.\r\n\r\n@mlucy said:\r\n\r\n> Do you want r(nil).ne(20) to return false outside of filter?\r\n\r\nThen @coffeemug said:\r\n\r\n> Yes, I do.\r\n\r\nAnd what you meant by this was:\r\n\r\n> I think `null` comparisons should work *exactly* the way they work now, *except* in the context of `filter`. If, within filter, you compare with `null` I think it should have the same behavior as comparing against a non-existent attribute (i.e. throw an error and have `filter` skip the row).\r\n\r\nI feel like I'm missing something here."
