      "I'd like to break this issue up; I think we can make individual parts better without making the whole thing better.  Here are the parts as I understand it:\r\n* Let `null` be included in indexes (this is easy).\r\n* Include errors in indexes so `order_by` is consistent (this is sorta easy).\r\n* Allow some way to access errors in indexes (this we'd have to debate a bit)."
