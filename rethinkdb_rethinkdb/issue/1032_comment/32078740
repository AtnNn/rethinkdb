      "I think we definitely need to sit down and think about how we handle NULL/non-existence/errors/comparisons, but I don't think we can do that before the LTS release.\r\n\r\nOne option would be to put off doing this issue until then.  Another one would be to patch it and revisit it a third time if and when we rework our error semantics."
