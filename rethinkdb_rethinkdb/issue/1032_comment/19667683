      "@coffeemug -- let's say you have a table of people who filled out a survery.  User A writes `{:name => \"Slava\", :age => nil}` to mean \"didn't provide age\", while user B writes `{:name => \"Slava\"}` to indicate the same thing.  Now let's say you create a secondary index on age.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we don't offer any way for either user to get the people who didn't enter their age.  If we index `null`, we solve user A's problem but not user B's.  If we say that `get_all(null)` means \"get everything not in the index\", we solve both user's problems.\r\n\r\nThis only *doesn't* work for users who are using `null` and non-existence in the same dataset to mean different things, which seems like a rare case to me, and even they would have a workaround (they could just tack a filter on the end)."
