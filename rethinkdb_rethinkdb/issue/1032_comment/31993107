      "@nviennot, even if we did implement that, the behavior would not always be the same between `get_all` and `filter`.  Secondary indexes are not necessarily of a single field in an row, they can be arbitrary deterministic functions applied to the entire document.  So when we say `get_all` with `r.error`, it means the function produced an error, rather than that a field is undefined (though that could be one of the causes)."
