      "Here's what I think we should do here:\r\n* Make `NULL` a legal index value.\r\n* Make non-existence errors in secondary index functions turn into a special serialized key that will sort the same as non-indexed `order_by` sorts them.\r\n  - If people want to exclude a row from an index, they can still do so by producing a normal error (e.g. with `r.error`).\r\n  - As part of this change, we should really move to a stable sort for unindexed `order_by`.\r\n* Open a new issue for retrieving errors from a secondary index."
