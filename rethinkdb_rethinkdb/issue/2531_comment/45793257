      "> I was curious why Python is the only driver documented this way?\r\n\r\nWe put a lot of effort into the API docs (the ones on rethinkdb.com/api) and are about to put a lot more. Since we have a whole system going for them, @AtnNn thought it would be easier to autogen python docs than to copy paste everything inline. Ideally we'd do it in other drivers, but haven't gotten to that yet.\r\n\r\n> Also is there any interest or opposition to updating build scripts to work with Python 3?\r\n\r\nIf they'd be backwards compatible with Python 2, that'd be great (I still don't have Python 3 on some of my systems)."
