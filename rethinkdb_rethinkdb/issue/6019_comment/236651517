      "Evicting the in-memory structures for tables that have not been used in a while is an interesting idea.\r\nThis should be technically doable.\r\n\r\nWe could for example have a configuration option per server that limits the number of \"loaded\" tables at a time, and then evict the least recently used one if an additional \"slot\" is needed.\r\n\r\nIt will probably take us a couple months before we can get to this, so I recommend looking for other alternatives in the meantime (maybe explicitly archiving the old data into a single table?)."
