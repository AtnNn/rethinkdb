        "I propose stripping out a lot of the functionality of the `init.d` script:\r\n\r\n* Support only a single instance of RethinkDB\r\n* Drop support for custom log file location\r\n* Drop support for custom pid file location\r\n* Do not use a custom data directory. Instead, cd to `/var/lib/rethinkdb` before starting the daemon, causing the data directory to be `/var/lib/rethinkdb/rethinkdb_data` by default.\r\n* Detect old-style config files an include documentation on how to convert them, and possibly convert them automatically for common cases.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking a lot about how to solve #3071 and this seems to me like the best solution. This would also make #2014 and #2037 possible."
