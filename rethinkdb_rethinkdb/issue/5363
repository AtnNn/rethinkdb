It says \"Killing x servers\", but that operation never completes. It also is unable to shut down the servers at the end of the test (it gets stuck in the \"Stopping fuzzing\" phase).\r\n\r\nThe `table_fuzzer.py` script itself hasn't changed it seems, so I assume this is caused by a change in the testing system.\r\n\r\nMentioning @larkost and @Tryneus ."
