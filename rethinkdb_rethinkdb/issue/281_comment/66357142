      "Passing around a connection everywhere is super annoying in Javascript (and probably other languages as well) with any non-trivial application where you have the app spread across multiple files. This issue is made even larger when you don't know whether that connection is active or has been closed or otherwise disconnected. I understand #3213 will help with that a bit, but calling `isOpen` every time you want to use a connection doesn't seem reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe ideal behavior I'd like is the ability to just call `.run()` without a connection and RethinkDB would just do its thing. That would be super nice. Generally the way to accomplish this and avoid passing around a connection everywhere is to keep a pool of connections on hand. Whether that \"pool\" is actually just one connection or not doesn't really matter to me, I am just looking for the automatic instantiation of connection(s) so I don't have to pass one around everywhere.\r\n\r\nI would really much prefer not to check connections in and out or really interact with connections at all.\r\n\r\nI understand cursors make this a bit trickier and (I believe) force the user to deal with connections, but #2721 would resolve that issue. We currently automatically `toArray` cursors and I believe most pool implementations do as well (e.g. https://github.com/mkleehammer/koa-rethinkdb-pool/blob/master/index.js#L114 https://github.com/hden/rethinkdb-pool/blob/master/src/index.coffee#L43 )"
