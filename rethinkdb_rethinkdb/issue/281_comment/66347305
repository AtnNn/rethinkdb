      "Why I want a connection pool: Because the current rethinkdb connection implementation sucks at handling concurrent requests at the moment. (But from what I see from the protocol, it should be totally doable to have concurrent requests on the wire -- and if QoS is a problem maybe this can be added later).\r\nWhy I don't want a connection pool: Because users would have to check in and check out connections, adding complexity, and burden on devs.\r\nAlso, naive load balancing / failovers can be handled at the application level easily. It's not a priority to me. There should be *some* logic when the connection fails at some point down in the application anyways."
