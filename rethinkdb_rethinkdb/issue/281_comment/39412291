      "@neumino As @Raynos pointed out in #249, using CoffeeScript limits the amount of contributions you get, simply because CoffeeScript is nowhere near as popular as JavaScript (sadly), so moving the JS driver to native JavaScript would be a real positive in terms of contributions, and in a lot of cases, will be more debuggable due to JavaScripts verbosity vs. CoffeeScript's."
