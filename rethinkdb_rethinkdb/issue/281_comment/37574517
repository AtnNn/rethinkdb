      "Connection pools are very useful when you want to issue a bunch of queries that don't need to see each other's writes.  (For example, two big inserts into different tables.)  Handling connection state might be a pain, but I think we could probably work it out in the official drivers.  (I'm more worried about the maintenance burden on third-party drivers.)"
