      "Perhaps I'm a bit late to the party, but I just want to add a vote for acquiring and releasing connections manually. Also, while I like the last two examples from @neumino's comment (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/281#issuecomment-39880820) I want to voice a bit of concern for his first:\r\n\r\n> query.run() // use the default pool and automatically get/release the connection when done\r\n\r\nAt least in Node, a default set on the `require('rethinkdb')` object would be persisted throughout other `require`s and act as a kind of global. Besides, I find it stylistically cleaner to separate the query and connection/pool."
