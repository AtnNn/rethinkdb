      "Getting and releasing a connection is definitely a lower-level API, but people still need it in case they want to do multiple things on one connection. We can wrap that API like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\npool.withConnection(function (conn) {\r\n  // ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt has a few benefits:\r\n\r\n- It's safe\r\n- It trivially translates to Python's `with` and Ruby's blocks\r\n- It lets people get a connection in case they want to"
