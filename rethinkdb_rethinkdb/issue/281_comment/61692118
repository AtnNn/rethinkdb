      "I was under the impression that it wasn't necessary to coordinate that in RethinkDB as opposed to MongoDB.  However, right now I have it set to leave the connection attached to the request the first time it is used, even from one of the fetch methods that returns a cursor.  I was thinking about attaching it but making it \"stealable\" by the pool if necessary - if using the same connection *is* important with RethinkDB (any pointers anyone?) then I would recommend keeping it attached to the request if (1) handed out by this.connect() or (2) if the query was a write.  I assume we can tell that from the result?"
