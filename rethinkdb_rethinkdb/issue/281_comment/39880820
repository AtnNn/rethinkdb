      "I'm really not a big fan of manually getting/releasing a connection for two reasons\r\n- it's not safe, people may release a connection when it's not safe to (like after a cursor) -- and running multiple queries on a same connection can produce unexpected results (like when the server fails to parse the token)\r\n- it's not as friendly as using\r\n\r\n```\r\nquery.run() // use the default pool and automatically get/release the connection when done\r\nquery.run(pool) // use the pool and automatically get/release the connection when done\r\nquery.run(connection) // Users should never do that when they have pools, except for feeds maybe\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso +1 for cluster pools and +2 if the cluster pools can be created with providing a single node information (loosely related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2119)"
