      "@danielmewes You got it! Even just passing the driver one server would be a-okay for us, we load balance behind an ELB anyhow which handles health checking and failover (similar to the cluster proxy setup you described above.)\r\n\r\nIt seems like, in any non-trivial application, this code needs to exist in one central area that handles establishing connections and reconnecting as necessary, otherwise you are passing around a possibly bad/closed connection. Automatic connection handling is one of the major selling points of e.g. @nviennot's nobrainer, @neumino's rethinkdbdash, etc. and I feel like it should be in RethinkDB itself instead of relying on third party driver wrappers... that is, if you want folks to use RethinkDB in production :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \r\n\r\nBut again it's not necessarily a connection pool -- a connection pool just happens to be one common solution to the problem."
