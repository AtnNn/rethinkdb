      "Thanks @dminkovsky for the suggestion.\r\n\r\nLike you said, it works with a Promise based interface, but not a callback one. However, we should be able to fine a way around.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm a little more worried about is how it behaves if at some point in your `then` chain, your return a promise that is not a Bluebird one (the resource may be disposed of when you still need it).\r\nI would have to test it through as I'm not completely sure how `using/dispose` is implemented."
