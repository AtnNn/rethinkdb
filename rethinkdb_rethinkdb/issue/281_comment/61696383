      "> Generally in RethinkDB, you have the guarantee that if you do a write and the write finishes successfully, and then later do a read, the read will see the write. This is independent of connections, and would work automatically with any connection pool.\r\n\r\nUnless you are connected to different servers, and the \"write ack\" setting is different from the number of servers?"
