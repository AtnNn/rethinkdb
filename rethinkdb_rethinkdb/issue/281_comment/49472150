      "P.S.\r\n\r\n> 15:22 < sakhm> arghh, connection pool APIs are quite frustrating\r\n\r\nAbove, I didn't mean to trivialize managing a pool of resources. It's definitely not trivial. And yes, it's all about the API. The API has to be dead simple and 100% foolproof. If not, it needs to be up to the developer to handle it themselves, because then they at least know how it works and what's going on. Resource managing is just too important."
