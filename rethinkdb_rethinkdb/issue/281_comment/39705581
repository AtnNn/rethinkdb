      "I've been meaning to look into this more carefully and write up my thoughts (since this has been a long-standing issue), but it would require some research on my part, and I haven't had the chance to do it yet. Since we're past the proposal stage, I don't think it will make it into 1.13, so I'm moving it into subsequent. I'll make sure to write up a concrete proposal before 1.14 planning. Assigning to self."
