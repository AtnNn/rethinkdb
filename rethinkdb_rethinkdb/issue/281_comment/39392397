      "Yep, in the case of `rethinkdbdash`, you can pass a connection to `run`.\r\nIt's only when you don't pass a connection that `run` is going to try to get a connection from the pool.\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote `rethinkdbdash` I didn't think of multiple pools. I saw the pool as a way to not have to pass a connection to `run`, but I can see why it can be useful.\r\n\r\nI also currently don't let people manually get a connection from the pool and put it back."
