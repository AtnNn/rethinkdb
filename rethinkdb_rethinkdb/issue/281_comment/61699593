      "Thanks - I'll keep the connection attached to the request for now, which will solve the 99% by reusing the same connection.  I'll add a way to discard it for weird circumstances where a request will stay running for an extended period of time after using the connection.  (I can't think of any case where that would be necessary, but someone will.)"
