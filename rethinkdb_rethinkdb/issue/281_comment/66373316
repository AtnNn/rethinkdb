      "Not to self-promote, but since [koa-rethinkdb-poll](https://github.com/mkleehammer/koa-rethinkdb-pool) was mentioned I thought I'd better write the README.  I'd been holding off publishing until I added a real connection pool, but it is very useful as is for just managing the connection and close -- I'm already using it in production as-is.  Something similar could easily be written for Express."
