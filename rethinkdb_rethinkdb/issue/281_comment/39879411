      "@hden -- ahh, thank you! This is *exactly* what I was envisioning, except you just saved me from designing a probably worse API, and making a bunch of mistakes! :grinning: This could also easily be adapted to other languages. It's awesome!\r\n\r\nThere are a few adaptions I'd like to make:\r\n\r\n- Explore the possibility of a default pool when calling `run` with no arguments\r\n- Consider merging cluster pools and regular pools (since everything in RethinkDB is designed to be a cluster). I think that could be done better\r\n- Lots of stuff in the `node-mysql` spec isn't relevant to our pool because it's specific to the mysql driver, and reql drivers already handle it. I'd like to clean that spec up.\r\n- Consider the possibility (or at least leave the door open) for cluster pools to automatically pick a good node to send queries to (since routing tables will soon be accessible via reql, and may be we'll even be able to subscribe to their feeds).\r\n\r\nI'll do that soon and write the result up here. I think we can get this scheduled for 1.14!\r\n\r\n"
