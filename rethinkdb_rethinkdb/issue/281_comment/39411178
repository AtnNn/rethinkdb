      "The main two differences with the two drivers are \r\n- promises - https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1395\r\n- the connection pool\r\n\r\nThe first point is almost done and will be released soon.\r\nThe second point is discussed here.\r\n\r\nSo the official driver is getting close to `rethinkdbdash`.\r\nThe differences then will be mostly about the environment (how you run the tests, etc.), and the code itself (`rethinkdbdash` is written in JavaScript, and the official driver in CoffeeScript).\r\n\r\nFor now, `rethinkdbdash` cannot be the official driver because\r\n- it uses only `node-protobuf` and doesn't work with `protobufjs`\r\n- it doesnt support http connections\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1868 will remove the need for protobuf and I plan to move `rethinkdbdash` to the JSON API.\r\n`rethinkdbdash` will have to support http connections at least to become the main driver.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it may happen at some point, but I don't know when."
