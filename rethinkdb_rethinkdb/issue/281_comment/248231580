      "I'm exploring RethinkDB and would like to settle on the best Node driver. It appears pooling is now the main differentiator between this and `rethinkdbdash`. Although this thread talks about pooling to be in the works for the official driver as well since 2014, there doesn't seem to be a recent update on it. Can somebody please help me choose, depending on what's on the current roadmap?"
