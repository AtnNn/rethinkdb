      "I'm working on https://github.com/hamiltop/exrethinkdb , a driver for Elixir. Due to Elixir's concurrency model, sharing a connection works perfectly fine (it's wrapped in an \"actor\"). Parallel queries and pipelining seem to work perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nAs such, I have a few questions:\r\n\r\n1. Are there performance gains to be had with a connection pool? It's my understanding that rethinkdb distributes the queries throughout the cluster regardless of which node is queried.\r\n2. Is there an api on rethinkdb that will allow a smart client to choose the correct node for the table being queried?"
