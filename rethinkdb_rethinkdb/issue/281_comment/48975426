      "@neumino -- could you write up a connection pool proposal as we discussed? We can then debate it here, settle on a spec, and implement it in all drivers. Please use https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql as inspiration -- it has a familiar, intuitive API, and has a good way of dealing with clusters of multiple nodes in the drivers (not everything there will apply to us, but it's a great template to start with)."
