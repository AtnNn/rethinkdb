      "If we end up having a connection pool, I'd be happy if we didn't have to check in / check out connections from the pool. But connections are not stateless, cursors and asynchronous/noreply requests adds state to the connection. Chances are, we'll have to explicitly get a connection from the pool, and give it back. I'd rather have a thread safe connection. There should be only little benefit from having a connection pool, except perhaps better scheduling reducing the latency (e.g. one thread is in the process of doing a huge bulk insert, and another one wants to do a very simple read)."
