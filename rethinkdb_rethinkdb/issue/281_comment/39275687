      "`run()` should always accept a connection if given one. If I want to connect to two different rethinkdb instances in the same thread (for example to do some data copying), I should be able to do so.\r\nAnd if I wish to have a connection pool for each of the databases, I should be able to do so.\r\nHaving a connection pool is an orthogonal concept from which connection to use by default.\r\n\r\nI don't see what's wrong with `repl`, even if there are connection pools. Maybe the name could be better, for example `default_connection=`."
