      "1. Yes.  We push as much work as possible to the shards, but some work has to be done on the machine that accepted the connection, and you'll also be limited by network bandwidth on that machine if all your clients are connecting to it.  (Also, if you have an unsharded table, you can drastically reduce intracluster traffic by connecting the only node hosting the table.)\r\n2. `r.table('whatever').config()` should tell you what nodes are acting as shards for the table."
