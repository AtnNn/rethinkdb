I see, this is in order to send the read to all *replicas*, not just to all *shards*. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/rdb_protocol/protocol.hpp#L434\r\n\r\nI was really surprised how this code could have worked for range gets, but as it turned out it's not used for range gets. I'll just move the unshard call out of the loop."
