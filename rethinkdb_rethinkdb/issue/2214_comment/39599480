      "That call to `unshard` looks wrong to me, but I think it should be outside the `for` loop rather than taking `i` as a parameter (looking at the code, it seems to expect the size of `responses` as its second argument rather than an offset into `responses`).\r\n\r\nAssigning to @danielmewes since this seems like part of the effee211 change and he presumably sort of understands what this code is supposed to be doing.\r\n\r\n(Also, @atnnn -- this is an example of what I was talking about the other day.  If the polyglot tests ran against sharded tables, we presumably would have caught this before releasing.)"
