      "@timmaxw @coffeemug mentioned you might know something about this code. Any idea why `read.unshard()` is called multiple times here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/immediate_consistency/branch/broadcaster.cc#L665 ? It seems that the implementations of the `rdb_r_unshard_visitor_t` https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/rdb_protocol/protocol.cc#L597 expect the full result set to be available when they are called."
