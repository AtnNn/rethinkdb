      "Hi csaintc,\r\n\r\nYou should only see those particular errors if the proxy node can't talk to one or more of your RethinkDB nodes.  I'm not sure what would cause that in your case.\r\n\r\nIs there any pattern to when the errors occur?  Do they usually last for a while, or is it that a single request fails and then the next request is fine?"
