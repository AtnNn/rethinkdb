      "@analytik With the round-robin IP that Kubernetes creates, I would highly recommend specifying a `canonical-address` explicitly for each proxy. The canonical address must be unique for the particular proxy server, and the other RethinkDB servers should be able to connect to it to reach the proxy.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB relies on being able to reach the same server (including proxies) consistently under their respective canonical addresses.\r\n\r\n(the same holds for the non-proxy servers, in case they have a round-robin IP as well)."
