      "@coffeemug We have to set the new version range that the replica has, in case we later want to backfill to or from the replica. This function serializes the new version range to the superblock.\r\nThe problem is that it iterates over all shards, updates one version range at a time, and re-serializes the whole information onto a blob each time. Hence the O(n^2) runtime in the number of shards."
