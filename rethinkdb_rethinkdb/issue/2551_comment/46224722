      "@coffeemug The change to the superblock is part of the write transaction started for the query and will be subject to whichever durability the query uses.\r\n\r\nIt causes one additional block write for the updated superblock.\r\nAs things are now, it can also cause a pretty high number of unnecessary index writes, which can cause additional writes to the LBA and drive up the LBA garbage ratio."
