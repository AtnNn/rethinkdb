      "I don't think I'll be working on this issue soon, but it may be important enough to schedule for a future sprint. The brew package has a user-contributed startup script and I think the arch package uses systemd, but the default config file and the cluster startup guide on the website only apply to the startup script distributed on ubuntu."
