      "Hello @robert-zaremba, thanks (again) for the feedback.\r\n\r\nI'm a little less sure about this issue. It sounds a little strange to have the name of the conf file as a default path for the data.\r\nI have never done it with a database, but I do switch from one conf file to another with apache (or other things) sometimes to try stuff.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug, @atnnn some thoughts about that?"
