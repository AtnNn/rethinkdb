        "Using the official NodeJS driver and the latest version of RethinkDB, I have a very strange case where my app's tests pass perfectly on all local and production machines, but fail in both Travis CI and Wercker CI environments. I use my own pooling for RethinkDB connections (with a max pool size of 1 for tests), and at some point, all queries begin timing out. At the very end of these failed tests, the following always appears:\n\n```\nPossibly unhandled RqlDriverError: First argument to `run` must be an open connection.\n    at new RqlDriverError (/home/travis/build/mike-marcacci/gandhi/node_modules/rethinkdb/errors.js:14:13)\n    at DbDrop.TermBase.run (/home/travis/build/mike-marcacci/gandhi/node_modules/rethinkdb/ast.js:135:15)\n    at /home/travis/build/mike-marcacci/gandhi/test/init/1.db.js:65:27\n    at TcpConnection.<anonymous> (/home/travis/build/mike-marcacci/gandhi/node_modules/rethinkdb/net.js:77:18)\n    at TcpConnection.g (events.js:180:16)\n    at TcpConnection.emit (events.js:95:17)\n    at Socket.<anonymous> (/home/travis/build/mike-marcacci/gandhi/node_modules/rethinkdb/net.js:541:27)\n    at Socket.emit (events.js:117:20)\n    at net.js:440:14\n    at process._tickCallback (node.js:419:13)\n```\n\n(above comes from https://travis-ci.org/mike-marcacci/gandhi/builds/43440800)\n\nIs there a way to do a health check on a connection before I pass it to `run`? If not, is there a way to catch and handle this error? It doesn't seem to be throwing or rejecting the promise.\n\nThanks in advance!\n"
