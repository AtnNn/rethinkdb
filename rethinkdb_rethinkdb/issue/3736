        "I have had in mind a command that could be used to implement many operations on sequences that are not currently possible. It would behave a little like `concat_map`, but with state. In pseudo-code, it would be something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsequence.scan(state, f, end) \8801\r\n  case f(state, head(sequence)) of\r\n    [state\8242, out] \8594 out.union(tail(sequence).scan(state\8242, f, end))\r\n    null \8594 \8709\r\n\8709.scan(state, f, end) \8801\r\n  end(state)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function `f` would be given the current state and the next input row, and it would produce the next state, and possibly generate output rows. `f` could also return `null` to end the sequence. The optional third argument `end` would be called when the input sequence is exhausted.\r\n\r\nFor example, it could be used to return every third row:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsequence.scan(0, lambda n, row: [n+1, r.branch(n.mod(3) == 0, [row], [])])\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo group rows without loading the whole table in memory:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable.order_by(index='time').scan({'val': null, 'group':[]}, lambda state, row:\r\n  r.branch(state['val'] == row['time'].truncate('seconds'),\r\n    [{'val': state['val'], 'group': state['group'].add([row])}, []],\r\n    [{'val': row['time'].truncate('seconds'), 'group': [row]}), [state['group']]],\r\n  lambda state: [state['group']])\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo count added and deleted rows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchangefeed.scan(0, lambda n, change:\r\n  r.branch(change['new_val'],1,0).add(\r\n    r.branch(change['old_val'],-1,0)).do(\r\n      lambda new_n: [new_n, [new_n]])))\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr to compute the Fibonacci sequence (compare to http://rethinkdb.com/blog/fib/):\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.range().scan(1, lambda a, b: [a + b, [a]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith #3579 it would also open a lot of possibilities for operating on changefeeds.\r\n\r\nI also wonder if better abstractions exists for operating on sequences in order and with state."
