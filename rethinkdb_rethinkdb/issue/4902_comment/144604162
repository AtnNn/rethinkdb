      "A quick clarification ahead: RethinkDB uses one raft cluster per table. That means that for each table, a different server can be the Raft leader.\r\n\r\nHow about exposing a `raft_leader` field in `table_status`, which gets set to the server that's currently the Raft leader (or `null` if there is no known leader)?\r\nI quite like that idea.\r\n\r\nAlso pinging @VeXocide for any thoughts on this."
