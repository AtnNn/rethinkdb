      "Ah yes, that's true for changefeeds. You can just register a changefeed without the `orderBy` and `limit` though, and that should give you the updates whenever a new message matching the filter appears in the logs.\r\n\r\nWhat I recommend doing is something like this:\r\n1. Register a changefeed with the correct filter on the `logs` table (without any `orderBy` or `limit`).\r\n2. Run the query with the `orderBy` and `limit(1)` to get the current raft leader\r\n3. If you have seen any notifications on the changefeed, use the raft leader from the changefeed. If not, use the one from the manual one-time query.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB 2.2 will have an `include_initial` option that allows you to get both the initial value and a changefeed together. We might be able to simplify this a bit once that option is available."
