      "@mbroadst No that's not what I meant. I just meant that since your query uses both the table configuration as well as the `logs` table, it doesn't work with changefeeds at the moment.\r\n\r\nThe changefeed query I mentioned above on the `logs` table works fine for me.\r\nSimilarly, once we have the `raft_leader` in the table configuration, you can listen to changes by simply doing:\r\n```js\r\nr.db('rethinkdb').table('table_status').filter({id: tableId})('raft_leader').changes()\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou just need to retrieve the table ID before.\r\n\r\nEventually you'll also be able to use the more efficient\r\n```js\r\nr.table(...).status()('raft_leader').changes()\r\n```\r\nbut this doesn't yet work because our changefeeds on single documents (rather than sequences) don't allow transformations (here: selecting the 'raft_leader' field) yet. We hope to add that functionality soon."
