      "@cefn I think the biggest issue we need to solve is designing an on-disk format for a document that allows e.g. appending to an embedded array without having to rewrite everything that comes after the array. Basically we will need some sort of per-document allocator I suspect.\r\n\r\nJSON-Patch might play a role for incremental updates over the wire, though I'm not sure about how this would fit in yet. Currently if you perform an `update` in ReQL, we send the update function itself to all replicas, which apply them locally. Nowhere is the full document transmitted over the wire (unless you use the `returnChanges` option http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/update/ )."
