      "@coffeemug:\r\n\r\n* I did not implement `binary_format='raw'` (I didn't see much of a use case), but that's a simple change - opened #2762 for this.\r\n* The thin wrappers in Ruby and Python simply inherit from `String` and `bytes`, respectively, without redefining anything.  They are functionally identical to a normal string, but we can tell if it was the result of `r.binary` in an earlier query."
