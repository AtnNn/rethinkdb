To clarify:\r\n\r\n- We'll use `count` to get the number of bytes and not add a `length` command\r\n- We'll call the type `binary` and the command `r.binary`\r\n- We'll accept both RFC 3548 and RFC 2045, and send back the common subset\r\n- We'll define `count`, `info`, `type_of`, `coerce_to` and the comparison operators to start with\r\n"
