      "The whole point of asking, why should `length` work on arrays, is the question:  What does this accomplish?  What bad things can happen?\r\n\r\nIt's not a question of \"What names make me *feel* good.\"  I can't think of any good things that happen by making `length` also work on arrays.  And it's easy to think of bad things happening."
