      "> The name `count` makes sense on tables because tables are not an ordered linear sequence the way arrays are. They do not have a \"length\".\r\n\r\nThis is off-topic, but tables *are* ordered (by the primary key of the rows), it's just that some operations (like reading from them in batches) ignore that ordering."
