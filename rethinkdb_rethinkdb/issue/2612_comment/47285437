      "@AtnNn Ah ok. I think I see the issue, I misunderstood that we were talking about what to coerce to a blob without the `r.binary()` wrapper. I agree that you can only really do that in Python3, since python2 strings are just overloaded with no way to discern the meaning.\r\n\r\nI was talking more about r.binary() not coercing a unicode string to a byte array."
