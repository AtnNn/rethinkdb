      "I'm fine with either `binary` or `bytes`.  I think that @srh is right that `binary` will be interpreted to mean \"data using the full 8 bits\", not \"a single boolean value\".  I would never interpret it as the second, and it's commonly used to mean the first.  (For example, Wikipedia describes Base64 as a binary-to-text encoding.)"
