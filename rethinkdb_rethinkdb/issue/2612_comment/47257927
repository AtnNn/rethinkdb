      "Python2 `str` is the same as Python3 `bytes`. Neither holds any encoding information. The `bytes()` function and `b\"123\"` syntax are just dummy operations to make migrating to Python3 easier. I'd say only those two respective types should be base64'd in Python. Implicitly converting unicode strings to bytes is probably a bad idea since the user doesn't get to pick the encoding, and when you retrieve it again you need to know that to decode it."
