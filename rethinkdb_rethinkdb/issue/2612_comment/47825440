      "I like this, though I think it's an overkill -- we don't really need comparison operators for the first version, and probably not `length` and `slice` (though those would be really cool). I'd keep those out and only add them if users want them (though I'm not opposed to adding them if we really want to).\r\n\r\nI'm on board with the definition of `coerceTo`, `typeOf`, and `info`."
