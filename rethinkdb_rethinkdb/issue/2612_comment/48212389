      "> OK, I think we should add a command length that works on blobs and arrays\r\n\r\nIf we're going to overload `length` for arrays, making it a synonym of `count`, then we should drop the name \"length\" altogether and just go with `count` for everything.  I don't see what causes you to want to overload `length` for arrays in the first place."
