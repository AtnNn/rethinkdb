      "> The \"raw\" representation: {\"$reql_type$\":\"binary\", \"data\":\"aB_-bc\"}, for example, where the data uses base64url with no padding (and no unrecognized characters). As long as the wire protocol actually uses this \"raw\" representation, any deviation from this precise format should be rejected.\r\n\r\nI think we should use normal base64 with '+' and '/'.  That's what most tools generate.  I think we should accept either padding or no padding and add padding ourself where it doesn't exist (there are several Base64 variants where padding is mandatory, but also at least one popular one where it's optional).\r\n\r\n> length\r\n\r\nI don't think we should introduce a new term for this.  Some other options I would prefer more:\r\n* Overload `count`.\r\n* Add a term `size` which will get the size in bytes of a string or binary data type.  (This is at least useful on multiple things.  Also, arguably `count` should be named `size`.)\r\n* Skip it for the first version."
