      "> > I think at a minimum we should accept both 3548 and 2045 and store them internally as the common subset.\r\n\r\n> I have no idea what you're talking about, but binary datums will surely be stored with a varint length N, followed by N bytes consisting of the binary data.\r\n\r\nTo save space, sure, but from the user's perspective it should be `{\"$reql_type$\": ..., \"data\": SOME_BASE64_STRING}` (if they call run with e.g. `binary_format: 'raw').  I'm saying that string we give them should be in the common subset of 3548 and 2045, so if they have a strict parser it will work with either."
