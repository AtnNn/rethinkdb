      "Please contemplate on how you would retrieve documents without the binary components. That is how would someone perform a query and get all the documents without the binary elements.\r\n\r\nPretend that I have a document with a handful of random metadata entries and 1 to 3 binary entries.  for speed reasons I want to look at all the meta data and my binary elements are 20MiB images.  clearly if I have 100k images I may want to look at all the metadata without the large images.  Excluding a key in the document may not be enough.  Those images might have different keys in each document. Clearly in that scenario exclusion via type would be useful."
