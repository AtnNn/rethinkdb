      "> If we're going to overload `length` for arrays, making it a synonym of `count`, then we should drop the name \"length\" altogether and just go with `count` for everything.\r\n\r\nI'd be ok with that too.\r\n\r\n> I don't see what causes you to want to overload `length` for arrays in the first place.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what @mlucy's rationale is, but I think `count` makes sense for tables since everyone's used to that in SQL, but the naming is a little weird to get the number of bytes in a blob. I think aliasing `length` to `count` makes sense, but I also wouldn't be opposed to just defining `length` on blobs. I basically think anything we do here will be ok."
