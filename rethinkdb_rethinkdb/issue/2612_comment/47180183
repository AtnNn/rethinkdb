      "I agree with this interface (although I might call the pseudotype \"BINARY\" or \"BASE64\" instead of \"BLOB\").\r\n\r\nOne question with this is what native types should be turned into binary pseudotypes.  In Ruby, people generally just put binary data in strings (there's no separate type for it, although strings can have encodings).\r\n\r\nIf we go with turning binary strings in Ruby into binary pseudotypes (and vice-versa), we might also want to offer an `r.binary(...)` command to turn a non-binary string into a blob (e.g. `r.binary(\"abc\")`)."
