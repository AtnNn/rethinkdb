      "> This is complete nonsense and not true at all.\r\n\r\nI apparently was misremembering.  Ruby's behavior with strings is kind of complicated, but it uses `size` to mean `length` and `bytesize` to mean number of bytes.  (Which, IMO, is what `size` should mean.)\r\n\r\nIf other people aren't using that convention, then we probably shouldn't use it.  A command `bytesize` which works on strings and binary blobs would be good.  Once we have Unicode support, a command `length` that works on both (and on arrays) would be good too."
