      "@mlucy pointed out that most languages have a `length` command to get the number of characters, and a `size` command to get the number of bytes. I agree that defining `size` on a string without defining `length` would make it likely people will misunderstand and misuse it. May be we should define `size` on the `bytes` type only, and then define it on a string when we add `length`? (Also `length` should be an alias with `count`).\r\n\r\nAlso, having slept on it, I'm not sure I like `bytes`. Can we call it `binary`?"
