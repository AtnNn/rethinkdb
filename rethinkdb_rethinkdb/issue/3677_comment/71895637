      "What machine was this on? If it was the-shadow, then I bet that it has rebooted since someone last VNC'ed into it, so it has not setup a virtual screen yet. CoreGraphics had a number of bugs in 10.7 when run headless on older hardware (most newer hardware has Intel GPU drivers, which usually avoid this). Most of those problems got fixed for 10.9, but their testing was really bad on this count. Logging in over VNC would solve the issue (you do not need to leave yourself logged in).\r\n\r\nAnd we are probably implicitly using CoreGraphics when creating the icon for the .dmg, possibly also when combining the multiple resolution background images. So those are the things to check."
