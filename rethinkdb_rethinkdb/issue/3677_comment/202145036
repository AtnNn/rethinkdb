      "For what it's worth, I googled for \"fe-accel-cgl.mm:390: fe_cgl_create_context(): Failed to create OpenGL context for accelerator. This may be fatal.\" and this is literally the only result.  I actually ran into it running `sips` to convert CR2(raw) files into jpg.  Maybe it helps...maybe it doesn't, but I figured I'd let you know :).  It also doesn't seem to be fatal in any way to my usage.  Maybe this is just a red herring and you can ignore it."
