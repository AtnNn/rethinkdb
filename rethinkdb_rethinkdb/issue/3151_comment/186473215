      "Since this issue is titled **Simplify setup of encrypted RethinkDB clusters**, it's probably a good idea to cross-post [this gist that I put together](https://gist.github.com/jlhawn/43f84f86579012470dc9) which is now probably *the simplest* guide to setting up an encrypted RethinkDB cluster. It uses an experimental build of my pull request. @kevincox, you should try it out!"
