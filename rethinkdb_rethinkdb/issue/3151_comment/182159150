      "@jlhawn this is amazing!\r\n\r\nAbout the command line arguments:\r\nThose look good to me.\r\n\r\nWe currently have options `--driver-port`, `--cluster-port` and `--http-port`, rather than `--web-port`. \r\nHowever I actually prefer the `web` prefix over the `http` prefix, since `http` makes it sound as if we had an HTTP-based query API.\r\n\r\nI actually think we should deprecate the `--http-port` option and rename it to `--web-port` as well. That will be a separate step though outside the TLS pull request.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus what do you think about these command line option names?"
