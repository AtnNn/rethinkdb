      "I think in general there are two options to approach this\r\n- use an external tool, but simplify setting it up (e.g. auto-generate the necessary config files etc.)\r\n- link with an encryption library to provide encryption out of the box\r\n\r\n@AtnNn pointed out to me that even if we link in an external library, we would likely dynamically load one that's distributed and maintained with the operating system / distribution. So we wouldn't have to be overly concerned about providing security support ourselves (unless we end up using it incorrectly, which can definitely happen).\r\n\r\nIf we go for the second option of using a cryptographic library, it would make sense to use the same one for client connections as well. In that case some TLS/SSL library seems like the obvious choice."
