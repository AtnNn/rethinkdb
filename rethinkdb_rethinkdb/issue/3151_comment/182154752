      "I've spent the past day or so figuring out how to add command line options for TLS (haven't looked into config file stuff yet) and I've come up with the following (this is what it prints out when you run `rethinkdb --help`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nTLS options:\r\n  --web-tls                                   secure the web administration console\r\n                                              with TLS\r\n  --web-tls-key                               private key to use for web\r\n                                              administration console TLS\r\n  --web-tls-cert                              certificate to use for web\r\n                                              administration console TLS\r\n  --driver-tls                                secure client driver connections with\r\n                                              TLS\r\n  --driver-tls-key                            private key to use for client driver\r\n                                              connection TLS\r\n  --driver-tls-cert                           certificate to use for client driver\r\n                                              connection TLS\r\n  --driver-tls-ca                             CA certificate bundle used to verify\r\n                                              client certificates; TLS client\r\n                                              authentication disabled if omitted\r\n  --cluster-tls                               secure intra-cluster connections with\r\n                                              TLS\r\n  --cluster-tls-key                           private key to use for intra-cluster\r\n                                              connection TLS\r\n  --cluster-tls-cert                          certificate to use for intra-cluster\r\n                                              connection TLS\r\n  --cluster-tls-ca                            CA certificate bundle used to verify\r\n                                              cluster peer certificates\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's divided into 3 sections - one each for the Admin Web Interface, client driver connections, and intra-cluster connections. Each has a flag `--{web|driver|cluster}-tls` which if specified enables TLS for those connections. If any of those flags are given, then the rest of the flags in that section must also be specified. Each section has an option for specifying the key and certificate files. The driver section's `--driver-tls-ca` is optional (if you want mutual TLS for client drivers) but the `--cluster-tls-ca` is required as I figured you'd want mutual TLS for intra-cluster connections."
