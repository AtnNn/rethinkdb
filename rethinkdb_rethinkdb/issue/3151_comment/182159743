      "Just a thought: Could there be a use case for binding the TLS listeners to separate ports in addition to the unencrypted ones? Probably this isn't too useful as long as the `--bind` parameters apply to all of them right?\r\n\r\nOne thing to consider is what happens if a non-TLS-enabled client, browser or cluster node connects to a TLS listener. We should at least test this. One thing we could probably do is using a different default port for the TLS listeners, so that it's harder to get mixups by accident.\r\n\r\n(PS @jlhawn to clarify: by \"we should\" I mean the RethinkDB team, and this can happen after the PR)"
