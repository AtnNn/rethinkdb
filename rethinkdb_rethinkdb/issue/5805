        "This isn't really a bug report, I'd like to check whether what I'm seeing is to be expected.\r\n\r\nRunning RethinkDB on Mac OS X, performance drops with time when inserting larger numbers of records \8212 from about 8-10k inserts/s at the beginning down to 1-2k inserts/s after 23M records have been inserted (it's for a table with no indexes, and the data is very homogeneous, records of around 1kB in size). Overall DB size approaches 35GB, and this is the largest table. The machine is a MacBook Pro with an SSD.\r\n\r\nThere are no indexes on the table, the table has soft durability, and I expected a consistent write speed, pretty much regardless of table size. I am surprised by the 8x decrease I'm seeing.\r\n\r\nNothing is CPU-bound, system stats show RethinkDB writing quite a bit (to be expected), and *reading* a lot (which I found puzzling). In fact, the process is reading much, much more than it is writing.\r\n\r\nIf this is to be expected, I think it might be worth considering mentioning it in the documentation, perhaps suggesting configuration changes.\r\n"
