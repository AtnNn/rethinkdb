        "Right now, `r.expr([{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'a': 1, 'b': 3}]).orderBy('a')` can behave non-deterministically because it is sorted with an unstable sorting algorithm.\n\nDifferent versions of libstdc++ or libc++ could give a different sorting order.\n\nWe must use std::stable_sort in many places where we use std::sort.\n\nWe should have order_by, and any other things have sorting behavior, have stable sort as part of their behavior that we keep and test.  (This only means anything when the input sequence has a defined order, i.e. when it's an array value or the result of an order_by query or something.)\n\nIt is not necessary to document this behavior to the end user.\n"
