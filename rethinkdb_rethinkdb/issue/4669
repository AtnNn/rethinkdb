        "After our recent reorganizing of the error classes we have some places where the drivers are over-using `ReqlDriverError`. The primary abuser is the JavaScript driver, but Python and Ruby also have some instances.\r\n\r\nI think that all of these should be `ReqlCompileError`s. The older reasoning was that these were driver-generated errors, rather than passed along from the server. That is not really an important attribute to users, so I think it is better to group them based on how a user need to react to them.\r\n\r\nJavaScript:\r\n- [x] `Expected X argument (not including options) but found Y.`, see `test/rql_test/src/arity.yaml`\r\n- [x] `Anonymous function returned `undefined`. Did you forget a `return`?` see `test/rql_test/src/aggregation.yaml`\r\n- [ ] `Object keys must be strings.` see `test/rql_test/src/datum/object.yaml`\r\n- [x] `Object field 'a' may not be undefined` see `test/rql_test/src/datum/object.yaml`\r\n- [x] `Second argument to `r.expr` must be a number or undefined.` see `test/rql_test/src/datum/object.yaml`\r\n- [x] `Maximum expression depth exceeded (you can override this with `r.expr(X, MAX_DEPTH)`).` see `test/rql_test/src/regression/1133.yaml`\r\n\r\nPython:\r\n- [x] `Object keys must be strings.` see `test/rql_test/src/datum/object.yaml`\r\n- [x] `Second argument to `r.expr` must be a number.` see `test/rql_test/src/datum/object.yaml`\r\n- [x] `Calling '>=' on result of infix bitwise operator:` see `test/rql_test/src/math_logic/logic.yaml`\r\n- [x] `Nesting depth limit exceeded` see `test/rql_test/src/regression/1133.yaml` (this should also have a period a the end of the statement for consistency)\r\n\r\nRuby:\r\n- [x] `Object keys must be strings.` see `test/rql_test/src/datum/object.yaml`\r\n- [x] `Second argument to `r.expr` must be a number.` see `test/rql_test/src/datum/object.yaml`\r\n- [x] `Calling '>=' on result of infix bitwise operator:` see `test/rql_test/src/math_logic/logic.yaml`\r\n- [x] `Nesting depth limit exceeded` see `test/rql_test/src/regression/1133.yaml` (this should also have a period a the end of the statement for consistency)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, once this is cleaned out a number of tests in `connections` will need to have their errors re-done and there will be some work there."
