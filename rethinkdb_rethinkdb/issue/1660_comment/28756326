      "Hum, my guess is that we just create too many backbone views.\r\nWe create one per table and 2 per database. If you have 500 tables, I can imagine it breaking.\r\n\r\nI would tend to think that the current architecture of the code in `admin/static/coffee/namespaces/index.coffee` is just over engineered and create too many views. I can try to a quick/dirty thing to reduce the numbers of view and we can check if it works better."
