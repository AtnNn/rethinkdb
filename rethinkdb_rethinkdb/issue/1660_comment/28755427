      "Also when I click \"Tables\" to get a table listing, my Firefox complains about a JS script that is taking too long, e.g. \"http://magneto:8082/cluster-min.js?v=foo:16246\". The exact line number varies though (foo is the version of my server).\r\n@neumino: At some point, maybe we could have a look at that together?"
