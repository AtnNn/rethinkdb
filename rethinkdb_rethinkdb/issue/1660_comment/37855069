      "@josephglanville -- you could go into a specific path to do monitoring FYI. For example, you can curl `/ajax/directory` to *only* get the contents of the directory.\r\n\r\nOn a different note, the monitoring experience currently leaves *a lot* to be desired. Would you mind writing up your experiences in #1392? I.e. what was it like to set up monitoring, what's good about it, what's bad about it, what could be improved, etc. If you could take a few minutes to do that, it would help immensely (and would make monitoring better for you!)"
