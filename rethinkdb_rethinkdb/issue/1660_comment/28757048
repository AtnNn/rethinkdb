      "The profiler shows most time on the server side being spent in `progress_app_t::handle()`. This is when viewing the dashboard, not the table view.\r\nThe function seems to be so slow because it copies `std::map<peer_id_t, cluster_directory_metadata_t>` a lot, which makes sense. I think I can optimize this quite easily by making use of some of the new functions that I added for improving overall directory scalability. I will give it a try."
