        "Am I correct in saying that object keys do not have any sort of compression or optimization?\n\nFor example, if I inserted `{'my_super_long_key_here': 'jessica'}` 5 times, would this result in 22 bytes being written to disk for every time that key is used? Or is there some sort of compression or pointer/ref used to prevent duplicates?\n\nPossibly related to #1396.\n"
