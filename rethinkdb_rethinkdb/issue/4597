        "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am having some problems while trying to run a Rethinkdb cluster in production using Kubernetes.\r\nI use your docker image from public registry. Once I launch a couple nodes which connect fine to each other, every 5 minutes or so I am having heartbeat timeouts.\r\n It is not usable as is in production as every time the connection timeouts, the connection is lost and the tables become unavailable until the server is connected again...\r\n\r\nUnder Kubernetes the docker version is 1.6, when you say the docker image is officially supported on docker version 1.7, could that cause my problem of heartbeat timeouts ?\r\n\r\nI tried on version 1.16.0-1 and version 2.0.4, same problem on both.\r\n\r\nThanks"
