      "So, the file at /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/rethinkdb is a symbol file, not an executable.  You can specify it in gdb using `-s /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/rethinkdb` on the command-line, or `symbol /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/rethinkdb` inside gdb, if it doesn't load it at startup.  I'm not sure what tells gdb where to look for the symbol file automatically.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty important that this symbol file is the result of the same build of rethinkdb, or none of the symbols will make sense.  I don't think we have a symbol file for the version that the original stack trace in this issue came from, so if you could produce one with the latest released version, that would help.\r\n"
