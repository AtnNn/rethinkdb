      "So, the symbols I'm getting back in the backtrace don't make much sense, but the one at the top of the stack could very well have segfaulted:\r\n```\r\n#0  0x000000000048804a in get_ips () at arch/io/network.cc:900\r\n```\r\nwhere\r\n```c\r\n    int addr_res = getifaddrs(&if_addrs);\r\n    guarantee_err(addr_res == 0, \"getifaddrs failed, could not determine local ip addresses\");\r\n\r\n    for (ifaddrs *p = if_addrs; p != NULL; p = p->ifa_next) {\r\n>>>     if (p->ifa_addr->sa_family == AF_INET) {\r\n            if (!(p->ifa_flags & IFF_LOOPBACK)) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe were assuming that `getifaddrs()` would not return a structure with `ifa_addr = NULL`, but according to the documentation, that's not always true.\r\n\r\nI fixed this in commit f872a0b8fb5bbc49b82b251ff2560fa37e1b40f7, and it should be published soon."
