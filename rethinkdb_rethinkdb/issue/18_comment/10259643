      "I think `apt-get install rethinkdb-dbg` should install the debugging symbols for use with gdb and an unstripped binary at `/usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/rethinkdb`.  \r\n\r\nA backtrace + core file from that unstripped binary would make debugging much easier.  You can run `ulimit -c unlimited` to turn core file generation on if it isn't already."
