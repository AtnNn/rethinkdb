      "Could one cause of this be if the user's home directory is ecryptfs (which is available as a default option on Ubuntu)?  I got a similar error on Ubuntu 11.10 (it printed different output - below - so not sure if it's actually the same error, but it had the same ultimate symptom that the initial `rethinkdb` command failed.  I tried again specifying `-d /var/data/sam/rethinkdb_data` (/var is ext4) and it seems to have worked.\r\n\r\nThe error I got:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rethinkdb create\r\ninfo: Our machine ID: <blah>\r\nerror: Inaccessible database file: \"rethinkdb_data/metadata\": Invalid argument\r\n       Some possible reasons:\r\n       - the database file couldn't be created or opened for reading and writing\r\n       - the database file is located on a filesystem that doesn't support O_DIRECT open flag (e.g. in case when the filesystem is working in journaled mode)\r\n       - user which was used to start the database is not an owner of the file\r\nCrashing while already crashed.
