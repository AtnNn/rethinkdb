        "While testing the MacOS package I found that libidn and libz were not statically linked, but rather were linked dynamically to a path in the build directory.\r\n\r\nThe problem turned out to be multi-layered:\r\n- `mk/support/pkg/curl.sh` has a line to try an fix this, but the `sed` command did not include the `-E` flag which is required for \"extended (modern) regular expressions\" was not included. \r\n- The patterns in the `sed` expression have spaces around them to keep them from matching other things (especially `-lz`), but since these flags were next to each other the spaces/patterns overlap, so `sed` only catches the first item.\r\n- `libidn` has a dependency on `libiconv` which is in `/usr/lib` on all systems, but not automatically picked up on MacOS. So on MacOS this would fail with unknown symbols.\r\n"
