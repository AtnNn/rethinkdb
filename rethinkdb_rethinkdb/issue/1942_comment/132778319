      "A quick test shows that the query is about 10x faster on 2.1 than it used to be. 15ms instead of 150ms without the `limit(0)`.\r\nThe query with `limit(0)` is still faster yet (0.1ms), so it seems that sending the function to the shards is still significant, but much faster than it used to be."
