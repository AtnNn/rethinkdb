        "`test_runner` files can currently specify what interpreter they are good for by adding the appropriate extension before the `.test` (e.g.: `bob.py.test`). However the `asyncio_connection.py` test is the first that is only valid for some versions of Python (3.4+). `test_runner` will need to get smarter about this.\r\n\r\nTrying to extend the extension chain to allow for this (e.g.: `bob.py3_4+.test`) would work, but we are going to see more and more complex versions of this problem, especially when we start to integrate Windows tests.\r\n\r\nInstead I propose that in cases that have more complicated requirements we substitute a `.meta` extension that tells `test-runner` to read the first section of the test file and look for specifically comments that would have this metadata, allowing us to extend this arbitrarily in the future. So for most cases we would only have to read the directory data for most files, but would have a way of putting more information in."
