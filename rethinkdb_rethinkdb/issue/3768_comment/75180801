      "Ran into this as well.\r\n\r\nThe effect is quite nasty since there's a default timeout (20 secs), by default nothing is closed, but after 20 secs the connection just silently stops working (you won't even get errors, promises just won't resolve).\r\n\r\nBasically the JS driver is completely broken by default, but you won't find out in tests because the repro requires 20 seconds of idling."
