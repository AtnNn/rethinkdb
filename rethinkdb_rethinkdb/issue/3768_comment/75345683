      "OK, I believe this is not an issue. This isn't our handshake timeout here, but rather a completely optional inactivity timeout the Node.js net library supports on sockets. Since we don't expose the socket directly, and we never user [socket.setTimeout](http://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_settimeout_timeout_callback), this event should never be raised. Essentially our handling of that event is dead code.\r\n\r\n@avaer I think the issue you're experiencing is actually caused by the recently fixed issue here: #3733 \r\n\r\nI'm closing this as invalid\r\n\r\n"
