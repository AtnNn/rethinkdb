        "As discussed before on many occasions `groupedMapReduce` is confusing, to a large degree because it isn't possible to see intermediary states of things. We should bite the bullet, and introduce a new stream of streams type. Then we can do:\n\n```\nseq.group(...)\nseq.group(...).map(...)\nseq.group(...).map(...).reduce(...)\n```\n\nAnd even `seq.group(...).reduce(...)```\n\nThere are some questions about what `map` and `reduce` actually mean over the stream-of-streams type, but this is workoutable.\n"
