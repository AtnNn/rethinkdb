      "When you created the table and configured it to replicate across the three servers one of the three was configured (probably automatically, but you can specify this) as the primary. When it went away a second was chosen as an interim replacement and between the detection of the first server being killed and the moment of handover is the first availability loss. When you brought back the first master it was now possible for the system to return to it's configure state and so it did, and the handover there caused the second (hopefully brief) loss of availability.\r\n\r\nImplementing #4331 would pave over this gap in the majority of cases. Or you could change the read mode so that the read does not have to go to the master."
