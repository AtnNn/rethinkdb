        "This idea is espoused by [MongoDB] (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mongodb-dev/dN9YwLijZDg/QTy6s72ayKoJ), [Riak] (http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/planning/backends/), [InfluxDB] (http://influxdb.com/docs/v0.8/advanced_topics/sharding_and_storage.html) and probably other databases.\r\n\r\nIt would allow RethinkDB users to choose the most appropriate storage backend for their specific needs (think of a storage backend that emphasizes smaller storage footprint versus another emphasizing increased speed).\r\n\r\nThe current underlying storage engine in RethinkDB could become a project on its own. It could then become an additional storage engine option for other systems, and in turn could get more pull requests in the long run.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, a separate project for the current storage engine would decrease the probability of having circular or unnecessary dependencies between the storage engine and the rest of RethinkDB, thus [lowering its maintenance cost] (http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/cyclic-dependencies/):\r\n\r\n> As John Lakos, the author, put it:\r\n*\"The maintenance cost of a subsystem can be reduced significantly by avoiding unnecessary dependencies among components\"*"
