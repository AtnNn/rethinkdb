      "Ouch, we've inadvertently moved into bad design territory here :cry: \r\n\r\nHere is what I think happened. In the previous versions of RethinkDB (before the clustering refactor), I think we had multiple operations in there -- renaming, and possibly permanently removing the server. Once we refactored and the notion of permanent removal went away, we probably took that out of the menu, but didn't bother to restructure it so that \"Rename\" is a top-level button. So now we have a dropdown menu with one operation in it (which is bad[tm]). (Also your point about the arrow icon is well taken)\r\n\r\nMany users asked for a porcelain \"decommission\" operation that safely divests the server of all its responsibilities. We'll add it eventually, so at least in the long-term this should stay an actual dropdown menu (and should have an arrow)."
