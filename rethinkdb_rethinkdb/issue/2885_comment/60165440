      "@coffeemug, could you make a decision on the format of `table_stats` and `server_stats`?  I think the idea is we want a format that we can grow into when adding more perfmons later, but for the 1.16 release, we would at most add a few perfmons (e.g. queries per second, .query duration, cache size per table)."
