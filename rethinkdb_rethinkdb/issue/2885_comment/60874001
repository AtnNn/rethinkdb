      "> @coffeemug does this look ok to you?\r\n\r\nYes. One option to avoid adding a per-table read/write metric while allowing people not to count dups is to expose info on whether a given table/server stats entry is for a primary replica (e.g. `{ primary_replica: true}`). I like this more since it allows people to slice the data any way they want without us duplicating it in various places. But if people object, I don't feel too strongly about it (I just think it's more elegant)."
