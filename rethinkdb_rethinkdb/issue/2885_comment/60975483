      "I have mixed feelings about that. On the one hand, it reduces duplication; the table was getting rather cluttered. On the other hand, there's no longer a natural way to get read/write stats for a given table; it's such a simple stat that it feels like people shouldn't have to do a complex query to get it. (For reads, they need to sum the stats for all servers; for writes, they have to take the stat on the primary, which should be the same as all the other servers.)"
