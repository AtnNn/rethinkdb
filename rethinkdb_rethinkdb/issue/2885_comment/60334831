      "As to which perfmons we might want to hide from the table:\r\n@wojons and I compiled this table when he was implementing RethinkDB monitoring for ElasticTrace: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RjfX8D9aQVKWQKUHnqY2uymf-kSGapLmQy_sGCxkgVg/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nNote that some perfmons are marked as \"internal metric\" (or their description uses the word obscure or similar). These are likely the ones we want to skip.\r\n\r\nI think @wojons is using most of the remaining ones for his monitoring solution, so we should not remove those unless there's a good reason for doing so."
