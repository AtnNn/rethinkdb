      "I still need to go over the formats but here are some replies that i have so far.\r\n\r\n>@Tryneus:  We can add these back in, I omitted them to avoid giving too much information to users. If we do give these kinds of stats to users, they would probably need to be per-server to avoid the discontinuities mentioned above.\r\n\r\nI think that this should stay on a per table issue its nice to know that this server is doing lots of so and so but when you have hurdeds of tables this can be come a problem.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes\r\n> Having disk writes/s reads/s is not a useful metric in general.\r\n> Instead I think we should have two things:\r\n\r\n> bytes written/s and bytes read/s\r\n> index writes/s\r\n> That would be a per-table property.\r\n\r\nI thnk speed of reads and writes is one thing but that is more of an ssd thing. On ssd lots of small reads and writes are fine but you can kill a spinning disk and it will say 1MB/s I think spead and number of read writes or blocks should be shown\r\n\r\n\r\n> From a technical point of view the primary key should be the pair [server_id, table_id], where table_id can be null for the server entries. I think this might also work reasonably well in practice. What do you think?\r\n\r\nI think this is great if its in a multi index\r\n\r\nI attached some of the photos so you can see how some of the stats that i get are used i have a few more that i am not graphing at the moment but should get the idea around.\r\n\r\n![elastictrace-rethinkdb-serverview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/139396/4836891/d05b2c96-5fcb-11e4-922d-15824dc6b8ef.png)\r\n\r\n![elastictrace-rethinkdb-table-view2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/139396/4836897/d718a00e-5fcb-11e4-9767-2e079bf8a5c8.png)\r\n"
