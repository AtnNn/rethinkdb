      "A few thoughts/questions:\r\n\r\n- What is `network.cluster_latency_ms`? the average latency to other servers in the cluster?\r\n- We used to have disk/cpu/memory stats a long time ago (before 1.2), but we took it out because it was a bit hard to properly implement for all filesystems.\r\n- More stats mean more intra cluster traffic. Last time I talked with @danielmewes (or maybe @Tryneus?) the stats were used only by the web interface, so we may want to not have too much stats to avoid heartbeat timeout.\r\n- https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2078 could make things nicer to compute stats per table.\r\n- Note that getting the number of disk reads/writes for all tables at the same time is a bit cumbersome (but I don't have a good solution).\r\n- Stats can currently timeout, and we report it in `/ajax/machines/timeout`. We should somehow be able to report timeouts. What happens if a server is down? Do we report it with special values, or just drop it?\r\n- Should we keep a short history? The time at which the stats were computed? Let users retrieve the stats for last second/minute/hour/day?"
