      "Thank you for your feedback @wojons.\r\nOur current plan is to leave all the current perfmons in more or less unchanged, but have them only accessible through a special debug table.\r\n\r\nYou will also be able to get the current GC activity from the `jobs` table in the future (#3115, as you know). There won't be a running total, but you could still generate plots from the instantaneous GC \"load\" value.\r\n\r\nI agree that something that's roughly equivalent to \"number of disk seeks\" would be very useful on rotational drives. However we don't currently have anything implemented to measure this. The writes/s that we currently have in `ajax/stat` isn't quite the same as that. `index_writes` is probably the closest we have right now, but even there the relation to disk seeks is not always obvious. That being said, you can also still access that from the debug table until we come up with a better perfmon for this sort of thing."
