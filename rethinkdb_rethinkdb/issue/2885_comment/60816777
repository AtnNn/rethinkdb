      "@coffeemug I think the reads/writes /sec should be computed by accumulating over all tables with a filter on the server. Does that sound reasonable? Otherwise we would just duplicate information in the schema (which is ok if there's a good reason to, but I'm not sure here).\r\n\r\nFrom a technical point of view the primary key should be the pair `[server_id, table_id]`, where `table_id` can be `null` for the server entries. I think this might also work reasonably well in practice. What do you think?"
