        "When selecting and designing with a database it is important to know the cost of what queries in what situations.  For example, it is often reasonable to use a quadratic query, if you know the size of your dataset will be under a certain size.\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful to have the expected time complexities of the queries in the documentation and the cases for which the complexity will be different.  This is something that [Redis does really well](http://redis.io/commands/ltrim) for example."
