        "I'm experiencing a weird issue with using javascript driver's `r.expr`. I'm calling it with an array of \n15323 objects to update the records in a table\n\n``` js\nr.expr(xs).forEach(x => r.table('name').get(x('id')).update({image: x('image')}))\n```\n\nIt seems like `r.expr` has a limit for an array length. The code works for 10000 but not for the full set.\nAny ideas of where to look for a possible solution?\n"
