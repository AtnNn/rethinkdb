      "Hi @YChebotaev, if you haven't done so yet, can you try updating the Python driver and see if that solves the problem?\r\n```\r\nsudo pip install --upgrade rethinkdb\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `rethinkdb dump` command is actually implemented as a part of the Python driver, so if you're using an older version it might not suppport the binary data type yet."
