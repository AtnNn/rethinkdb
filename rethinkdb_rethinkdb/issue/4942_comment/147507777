      "Awesome, thanks for the PR @mbroadst.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned on IRC, changing the serialization of `table_status_response_t` is fine. I think changing `table_raft_state_t` actually isn't an option here, because that's the state that's maintained *through* Raft (i.e. the table configuration etc.).\r\n\r\n@VeXocide Could you review the code please when you have some time?"
