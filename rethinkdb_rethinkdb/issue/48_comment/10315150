      "Its a new breed of task management / bookmarking software.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we are collecting all web browsing activity and events such as opening/selecting tabs.\r\nSecondly, we store a collection of tasks for each user, each with a collection of posts (containing web links/notes/emails/etc.) with comments (like a Facebook post).\r\n\r\nWe're then running analytics over the browsing events in real time to determine which webpages are most useful for which tasks. So kind of like Facebook's old \"recently read articles\" feature, but for private tasks."
