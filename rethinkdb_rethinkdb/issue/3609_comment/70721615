      "First: please separate things into their own issues unless you have reason to believe that they are related.\r\n\r\n- `connections/connection.js` error is #2649\r\n- `connections/http.js` error is a byproduct of #3540\r\n- `connections/http.rb` looks like a bad setup of twisted on your system. Are you using a non-standard Python setup? This is working on stock Pythons on 10.7, 10.9, and 10.10.\r\n- `server_test.rb` error is #3375\r\n- `connections/connection.py` is straightforward, and is a new issue (we need to catch the new errors coming in line 182 of `/drivers/python/rethinkdb/net.py`\r\n\r\nSo the one Issue that actually needs to be written up is: `connections/connection.py`, which is done in #3622.\r\n"
