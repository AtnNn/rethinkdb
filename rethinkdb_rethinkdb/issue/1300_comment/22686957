      "> I think we should store the local timezone in the reql object.\r\n\r\nDo the other drivers do that? I feel like we need a consistent behavior here across all drivers (if possible), I don't think it's sensible to just patch a single driver. Also, I thought we had a discussion about something like this very recently, didn't we?\r\n\r\nMoving to unassigned milestone for now, until we can clear up what we want to do."
