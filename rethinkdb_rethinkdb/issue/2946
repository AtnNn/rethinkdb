        "# 1915 will allow for partial deserialization: we can load a datum from disk as a binary blob, then deserialize it only as we need parts of it. But we could go further than that, and actually load it only as we need parts of it. This would probably improve performance for very large documents. But it would significantly increase the implementation complexity, because the deserialization logic would have to handle lots of awkward corner cases involving deserializing from non-contiguous buffers. Also, we'd have to deal with the fact that a `datum_t` might internally be tied to some buffers in a buffer cache, and that would also increase complexity.\n\nI'm putting this in backlog for now. We can discuss it more if this turns out to still be a performance bottleneck even after #1915 is complete.\n"
