      "I somehow couldn't get the tcp connection to time out after 2 hours (that's the default timeout value on Linux).\r\nMaybe the server is pinging the server? Or node is?\r\n\r\nNow the event is just lost, and the connection object ends up in a inconsistent state (the socket is closed, but we still considered it valid).\r\nSo next time the user tries to send a query, the driver will try to write on it and that will throw an error."
