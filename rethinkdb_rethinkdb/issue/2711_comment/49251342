      "I talked to @neumino about this in person. To clarify this issue, @neumino means that if the user puts a write and then a read on the connection without waiting for the ack, the read shouldn't be guaranteed to see the write. (A user could do this in JS if they don't wait for a callback, or in other drivers by sending queries from multiple threads)"
