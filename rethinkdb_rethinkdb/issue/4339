        "The `./test/run -v changefeeds.basic` test is showing a case where failover is not happening when a primary goes down. The failure is in the `test_primary_falure` subtest and the steps that it goes through:\n1. spin up 3 server instances, joined as a cluster\n2. create a single table with 3 replicas, filled with a 10 records of sample data (like: `{'id':1}`)\n3. figure out the primary for the first/single shard and get the id of a record in that range\n4. create a table changefeed using a replica other than the primary as the server\n5. confirm that the changefeed works (update the record, read the change out)\n6. kill the primary server\n7. try step 5 again, expecting an error when we change from the feed\n\nBut instead we are getting a failure in step 7 when we try to update the record. Specifically the error is:\n\n```\nRqlRuntimeError: Cannot perform write: primary replica for shard [\"\", +inf) not available in:\nr.db('test').table('basic_py2_7_6').get(1).update(r.expr({'update': 1}))\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n```\n"
