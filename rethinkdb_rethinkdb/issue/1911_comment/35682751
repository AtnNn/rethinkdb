      "I'm extremely skeptical of outside paxos libraries.\r\n\r\nlibpaxos3 looks like it was written by some dude (http://atelier.inf.usi.ch/~sciascid/), has like 4 simple tests (https://bitbucket.org/sciascid/libpaxos/src/20414d195443e9fe82973f0a0be8c5a3bd24e954/unit/?at=master), doesn't appear to have a bug tracker, had a super-low-traffic mailing list (http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=libpaxos-general), and has bug reports in said mailing list that don't seem to all be resolved."
