      "I think #1913 is a good idea, and it could even fit into one of the phases I proposed above, but it is also orthogonal to a lot of these features.  It would be really nice if we could use some higher-level constructs for dealing with the goals, blueprints, and even consensus (the libraries available for C/C++ are pretty sparse), but at the same time, it wouldn't necessarily affect the user experience for some time."
