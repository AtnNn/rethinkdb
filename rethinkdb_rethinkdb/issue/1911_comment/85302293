      "The ideas in here have pretty much been translated into the ReQL admin interface that we shipped with 1.16 and the Raft rework that @timmaxw has been working on for the past months.\r\n\r\nThere are some separate issues (query routing, hash sharding etc.) that are already tracked elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI think this thread has outlived its usefulness."
