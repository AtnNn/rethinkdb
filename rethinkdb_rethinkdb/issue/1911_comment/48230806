      "I talked a little with @timmaxw last Monday and asked him a few questions. I don't remember all of them, but here are a few (feel free to open an issue if they are relevant)\r\n\r\n- How are we going to relieve the master of a shard (now it takes all the writes+read) -- slightly related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2119\r\n\r\n- Can we remove the state of each hash shard and instead send back one value (whether the shard is ready or not). That should decreaze the size of the directory roughly by 8.\r\n\r\n- Can we clean the content of `ajax/stat`. They are pretty big, and the web interface filter them with a regex, but from what I know, the whole thing is sent between servers, which probably create a lot of intra-cluster traffic.\r\nAnd actually, same question for the content in `ajax`\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure there was other stuff, but I somehow can't remember. I'll add another comment if something comes up."
