      "Phase 1 sounds like a really good optimization. When removing \"nothing\" from the directory, there is a small complication to watch out for. When the current system is switching between two roles, it temporarily has no directory entry. For example, when it is switching from \"primary\" to \"secondary\", it first removes the \"primary\" entry and then adds the \"secondary\" entry, so it briefly has no entry at all. It's important to distinguish between this case and a true \"nothing\". This should be easy to fix by inserting a placeholder during the switch-over, or perhaps by leaving the old entry until the new entry is ready.\r\n\r\nYour description for Phase 2 is not very clear, and a lot of details are missing. Would you mind writing it up in more detail? Perhaps it should be a separate issue, to keep the discussion organized.\r\n\r\nYou propose to move the web UI into a separate process (presumably Python) in Phase 3. I suggest you consider moving the suggester and auto-failover logic into the separate process as well. Then, if you do Phase 3 before Phase 2, the consensus system could be integrated in Python rather than C++, which might be nicer."
