      "I agree. The advantage of doing it soon is that the longer we wait, the more code we have to write in C++ and later port to Python. The disadvantage is that it will take a lot of time, and there is no direct payoff in terms of user experience or making any particular issue easier to solve. So the correct answer depends on the development schedule, which I don't know very much about. I just wanted to suggest that you keep it in mind. :smiley:"
