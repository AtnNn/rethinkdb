      "> You propose to move the web UI into a separate process (presumably Python) in Phase 3\r\n\r\nI don't think @Tryneus proposed that. I think he meant implementing a ReQL API to conveniently manage the cluster via client drivers, and then switching the WebUI and the Admin UI to use this API instead of writing to semilattices directly. That doesn't require moving the WebUI out."
