      "That's arguably the intended behavior, but I think it's probably worth changing.\r\n\r\n`squash: true` just means \"if you back up changes while waiting for my client to fetch the next batch, feel free to combine them\".  (The clients prefetch batches as you consume your data, which is how we do flow control.)  `squash: n` means \"feel free to combine changes, and I want to reduce bandwidth so try to wait `n` seconds between batches even if my driver requests them faster than that so that more changes can be squashed together\".\r\n\r\nI think that we probably don't want the `squash` timer to delay the `ready` document, though; we should probably special-case that one and send it as soon as possible no matter what `squash` is set to."
