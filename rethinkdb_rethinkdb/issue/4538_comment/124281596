      "@bnosrat The problem for me is that the way the JS Date objet is handled makes using the results as JSON impossible.\r\n\r\n`r.expr({date: r.epochTime(10000)})`\r\n\r\nWhen rendered in the Data Explorer gives:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\"date\": Thu Jan 01 1970 02:46:40 GMT+00:00\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you pass the result through `JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)` you get:\r\n\r\n``` {\"date\":\"1970-01-01T02:46:40.000Z\"}```\r\n\r\nwhich is actually useful.  I understand the need not to confuse people, but I would think that the result being actual usable JSON would be an equal if not bigger priority.  It's so incredibly useful and productive from a user perspective to be able to take the results from the Data Explorer and paste them into other places that can handle JSON.  As it stands, the data shown in the Data Explorer can't be used anywhere else without going through by hand and replacing the dates with proper strings.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, as far as the argument that it's somehow different to render a string, what's being rendered right now is just text, not any form that can immediately be turned into a JS Date objet.  Maybe if it was `new Date(\"1970-01-01T02:46:40.000Z\")`, I'd buy that argument but that isn't valid JSON either."
