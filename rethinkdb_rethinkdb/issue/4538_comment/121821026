      "regarding the formatting, I was even thinking of something where you don't necessarily write a valid query expression like `r.epochTime(123456)` but have the option of printing an ISO8601 format that you could then paste as an argument to `r.ISO8601`.  I could imagine a few options:\r\n\r\n- current rendering, which is the JS Date object's toString() method\r\n- print as ISO8601\r\n- print as epochTime\r\n\r\n"
