      "so, let me update my thoughts... reconsidering the raw view, it's is valid JSON\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"date\": {\r\n        \"$reql_type$\": \"TIME\",\r\n        \"epoch_time\": 10000,\r\n        \"timezone\": \"+00:00\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthinking about the workflow some more, I guess if the Dates were strings, you'd lose the semantic tag of the field being a Date as opposed to an ordinary string. I can see the value of this and in any tooling that takes the data directly, it would just need an interpreting layer to convert `$reql_type$`to a JS Date object.  \r\n\r\nLooking at it from this perspective, I'm not sure my feature request is really a useful one.
