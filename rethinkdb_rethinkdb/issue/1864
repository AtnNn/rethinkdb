        "A lot of people want to use `distinct` on large tables.  We should do two things, I think:\r\n* Make `distinct` less inefficient.  Use an internal map that we update rather than forcing everything into an array.  This will help the case where there's a large input stream but only a few distinct elements.\r\n* Add a version of `distinct` that works on indexes, like `r.table('test').distinct(index:'user_id')` (we can do this efficiently because we can efficiently access a sorted representation).  This will give people an option when they want to do this and their input *and* output streams are too big."
