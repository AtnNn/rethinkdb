      "Insert performance woes will be partially solved in 1.5. The import command has a separate problem with slow inserts that we'll also try to solve ASAP.\r\n\r\nAs for disk space utilization, unfortunately it will have to wait until 1.6 or 1.7. Rethink has a lot of performance issues and the next few releases will be all about that. I can assure you that disk space issues will be solved (in case you're wondering if that's on our radar), but it likely won't be done until mid-late summer."
