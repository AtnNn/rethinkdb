      "@coffeemug I seem to have misplaced the code I used to produce the data I saw, but I do still have some graphs that I generated using the data. I ran the tests a few different times. The [first set of graphs](http://db.tt/7KwY1v0i) started out with just a single table in RethinkDB with a single-indexed (PK) table with the same columns in MySQL. The blue line you see toward the right side of the graphs is when I decided to see how things would change with a slightly more normalized setup in MySQL in addition to the non-normalized table and the RethinkDB table. It's kinda hard to see because it's just a thumbnail of the original that was overwritten by a later test.\r\n\r\nThe [second set of graphs](http://db.tt/LXgKzqO3) is a bit easier to read and illustrates more information. However, the test started to fail toward the end due to dropped connections that I didn't properly reconnect.\r\n\r\nThe data for the test were simply messages that I received in weechat. I wrote a plugin that sent any messages I received in a slew of IRC channels to both RethinkDB and MySQL. I was able to get grow my datasets quickly by joining a bunch of channels at once. I wasn't storing a whole lot of information for each message. I think the columns were something like: channel name, sender name, message, timestamp, and maybe a few other columns to indicate whether or not the message should be highlighted or whatever.\r\n\r\nI can try to dig up the code/schema I used if that would be of use to you."
