      "Hi @thoughtpolice. As a general policy we don't like to rename the issues in our issue tracker because it breaks email threads. Even it cases like this where the new name better reflects what the issues is about we've found it's just better to stick with the old name and avoid the confusion for people following via email. Thanks in advance for your cooperation and hopefully we can get this issue resolved ASAP."
