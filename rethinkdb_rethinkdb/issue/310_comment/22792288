      "@srh -- I know there has been a fix put in so data uses 8x less space (which is awesome!) However, for workloads where data is temporary in nature, does the closure of this bug mean that data files no longer have unbounded growth?\r\n\r\nThis is important to me because I will often load a whole database, temporarily process it and drop it. It'd be nice if I wasn't continually ratcheting up my disk usage."
