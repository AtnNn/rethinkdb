      "@codekoala -- could you describe more precisely what the test looks like? RethinkDB is a bit greedy with disk, but typically isn't 32x as greedy. Having a bit more info about the precise workload would help a lot. (FYI -- we'll be starting a lot of optimization work in the next week or so, so as much info as possible would help tremendously)"
