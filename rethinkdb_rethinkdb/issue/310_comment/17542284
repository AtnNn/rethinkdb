      "@coffeemug I performed my tests using the latest version of RethinkDB in the middle of February 2013. The graph images were produced on the 19th of February, after I had been running different variations of the test for a few days. Based on that, it seems that I would have been running either 1.3.1 or 1.3.2.\r\n\r\nI look forward to seeing how this turns out! Thanks!"
