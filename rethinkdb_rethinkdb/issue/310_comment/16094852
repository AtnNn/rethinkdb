      "@thoughtpolice, thanks so much for the detailed report on how to reproduce this! Phenomenally documented-- this makes our job that much easier.\r\n\r\nRegarding the insert performance, we're in the midst of working on 1.5 (which is adding secondary indexes), but the following release (1.6) will target performance bottlenecks. You can also track #457, which is specifically about an insert performance regression introduced in 1.4.\r\n\r\nWe'll get to work on replicating this and tracking disk usage / space utilization. Assigning this to @Tryneus to replicate this when he gets a chance (@coffemug, please confirm)."
