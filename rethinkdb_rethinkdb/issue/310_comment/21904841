      "#939 is done.  Garbage collector settings are generally equivalent, we still don't do compression, and file sizes are truncated, but our garbage collection code does not yet aggressively collect extents near the end of a largely empty file.  An extent that's completely used which sits at the end of the file, or perhaps a long-lived LBA extent, will sit by uncollected for quite some time, keeping the file size artificially high.  It remains to be seen whether that happens \"in practice\"."
