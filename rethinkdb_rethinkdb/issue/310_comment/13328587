      "I see; this makes much more sense. I was shooting in the dark because the data merely compressed so well. If it was so simple you probably would have done it earlier. :)\r\n\r\nI'm a wee bit tired now but I'll attempt to fully replicate my environment again tomorrow and have a good bug report for you. I also noticed some performance characteristics on OS X I thought were odd. I also have a moderately beefy linux machine with 16GB of RAM, so I can try and replicate the issue there too."
