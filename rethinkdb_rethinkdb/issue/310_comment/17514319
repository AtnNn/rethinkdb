      "Ah, I see, so this was an insert-only workload.\r\n\r\nI think there are two things going on here. The first, is that RethinkDB on-disk compactor was poorly tuned, which was fixed. I'm not sure if you ran the tests before or after that happened -- do you remember the version of Rethink you ran the tests on?\r\n\r\nThe second issue is that the GC currently doesn't ever lower the file size. So, if there is a sustained write-only workload, the file grows in an unbounded way while most of it is empty. This clearly needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nI'm moving this to 1.6 -- we'll deal with it as part of the optimization work (though compression still won't make it in, the size explosion issue will be fixed)."
