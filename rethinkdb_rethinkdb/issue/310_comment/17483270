      "I am looking forward to seeing this, as size-on-disk my biggest pain point with the handful of nosql datastores I've used. I recently ran a comparison of RethinkDB vs MySQL as a sort of logging server. Rethink's size on disk was consistently 32x what MySQL used for the same data in a non-normalized, single-index MyISAM table."
