      "Whoah whoah whoah.  I didn't look at this before, but that on-disk numeric format is incorrect.  The format for numbers is supposed to be:\r\n\r\n`N<a hex representation that sorts correctly>#<a printed representation>`\r\n\r\nIt looks like you changed a `%lx` to a `PRIi64`.  Now that it's printing as a signed decimal rather than a hex number, the on-disk sorting no longer matches the JSON internal sorting.\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/packaging3/src/http/json.cc#L65\r\n\r\n"
