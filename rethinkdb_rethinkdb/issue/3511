        "If you run `r.expr(true).all()` in the data explorer instead of throwing, the query appears to be evaluated as  `r.expr(true).and()` and returns `true`. So the issue is two-fold:\r\n\r\n1. I would expect to get `TypeError: undefined is not a function`\r\n1. I think calling `and/or` with no arguments should throw something like `RqlDriverError: Expected at least 1 argument but found 0.`\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, I tried doing the same thing with a few other terms that are used internally but not exposed like `FUNC`, but it seems to only apply to `ANY/ALL`."
