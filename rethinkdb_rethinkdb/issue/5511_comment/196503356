      "This is normal. Even in a completely empty table, there will still be some metadata and index structures in the file. The way RethinkDB's storage format works, that metadata can be placed at any location within the file. If it was placed let's say around the 75 MB mark while the table was full, that would stop RethinkDB from being able to shrink the file below 75 MB until that piece of metadata is no longer used.\r\nIf you keep writing to the table, it will eventually get moved towards the beginning of the file and the space will be freed. This can however take a while."
