      "Ping @Tryneus. Would we use a single session for this sequence of requests?\r\n\r\nIt seems that the way to enable the cookie engine in libcurl without having to specify a path for permanently storying them is through the CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE flag:\r\nhttp://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE.html\r\n> Given an empty or non-existing file or by passing the empty string (\"\") to this option, you can enable the cookie engine without reading any initial cookies.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be enough to set that option?"
