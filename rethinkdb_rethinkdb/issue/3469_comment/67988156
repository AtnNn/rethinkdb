      "@danielmewes, it would be pretty easy to enable this, but at the moment we do not share cURL sessions across requests.  For example, when performing depagination, each subsequent request will be sent to an arbitrary worker process, authenticate using a new `CURL*` handle, and thus have its own set of cookies.\r\n\r\nThis is still probably better than what we do now, considering some servers may require cookies."
