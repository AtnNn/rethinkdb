      "I'm not familiar with node domains myself, but I'm a bit wary of modifying the code if there isn't an identifiable error. I can look into it more deeply later and make a more informed decision on it. For now I'm going to put it in the backlog, but if you are able to reproduce the error with the driver let me know and we can bump up the priority.\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting @svarogg "
