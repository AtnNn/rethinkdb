      "@deontologician I have initially encountered this problem when using the loopback rethinkdb connector. I have opened a ticket in the connector's repository: https://github.com/fuwaneko/loopback-connector-rethinkdb/issues/7 but after some investigation I have seen that the fix could be in the driver (all details in the link).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when writing a shorter example to demonstrate this issue, I have seen that without the connector things work:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/perfectedTech/12e8156e9e882057ca0a\r\n\r\nI must admit that I no longer fully understand the problem, and nodejs domains are new to me, but the the conjunction of loopback and rethinkdb definitely creates a problem.\r\n\r\nPlease advise. If you believe this is not a driver problem, this can probably be fixed inside the connector.\r\nThanks."
