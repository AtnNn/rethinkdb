        "We might come to 2 cases when we set superblock metainfo:\r\n- key is already exist\r\n- key is not exist\r\n\r\nFor the first case, we might simply read all metainfo out into a buffer,\r\nand modify to update new value, and then write the modified buffer back.\r\n\r\nHowever, for the second case, there is no need to write whole buffer\r\nback; instead, we can just append new <key, value> at tail to avoid\r\nunnecessary write.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Liu Aleaxander <Aleaxander@gmail.com>"
