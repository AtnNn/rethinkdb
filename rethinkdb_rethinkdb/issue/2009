In the web ui table view, the array is collapsed by default.\n\nThis needs a lot of careful love. For example, for small array elements we should present them on one line in the tree view, and show them inline (potentially with a `...`) in the table view. Also, there should be expand all/collapse all buttons.\n\nThere might be some 80/20 solution here, but we need think about it carefully and make some improvements.\n"
