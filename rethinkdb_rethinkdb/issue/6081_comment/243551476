      "The current behavior makes sense insofar as that a `date()` actually describes a different time range in different time zones. August 28th in UTC+2 is not the same as August 28th in UTC (though they do intersect).\r\n\r\nA more robust version of the example would be:\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"users\").filter(lambda user:\r\n    user[\"birthdate\"].during(r.now().date(), r.now.date() + 24*60*60)\r\n).run(conn)\r\n```\r\n\r\n"
