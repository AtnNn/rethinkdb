        "The \"alt\" cache is in branch sam_97_alt.\n\nThe current status is that the \"alt\" cache is finished enough to be integrated with the rest of the codebase.  The following parts have been changed to use the alt cache:\n- The disk backed queue.\n- blob_t (in a separate type, alt::blob_t)\n- _update_: most btree code and memcache code.\n- _update_: all of the code, modulo some aspects and features of the alt cache that aren't supported yet, such as soft durability, subtree snapshotting, perfmons, order tokens.\n\nAfter migrating the rest of the codebase to the cache is done, some other changes to the cache will need to be made (perfmons, integration with issue #97, throttling?, soft durability support, etc).\n"
