      "I'm actually really confused by this code here. It seems that we construct a COW ptr using a shared reference to a local variable and then just assert that it has an entry in the namespace map and that it isn't deleted. Why are we making a cow ptr at all? This is probably besides the point of this particular issue it seems as if this might be racing with semilattice propagation."
