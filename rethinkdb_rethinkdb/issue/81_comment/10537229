      "Ok, so it looks like you're right about the issue being a race with semilattice propagation, and I believe it should only happen with import, not with client drivers.  The problem is that since import is a temporary member of the cluster, we want to do the metadata change through another peer, so we use `metadata_change_handler_t`.  This object returns as soon as it sends the update to the remote peer, but it seems that it should either wait for the metadata change to propagate back, or we should have import `sync_from()` that peer before waiting for table readiness."
