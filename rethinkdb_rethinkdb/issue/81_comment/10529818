      "This is the import process crashing.  It's using the wait_for_table_readiness function from rdb_protocol/query_language.cc, though, which other places use.  So if there's a race there, it could affect table creation elsewhere.  I suppose it's possible that import does something wrong before the call, though, I'll check out this issue next."
