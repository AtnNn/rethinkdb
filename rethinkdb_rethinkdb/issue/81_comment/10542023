      "Ok, this was tough to reproduce without modifications to the code.  But, once I added a `nap(1000)` in the `metadata_change_handler_t` on the `SERVER_PEER` side before it actually commits the metadata change, this became consistently reproducible.\r\n\r\nI have a change in code review at the moment that fixes this."
