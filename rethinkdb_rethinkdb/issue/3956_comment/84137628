      "@mlucy -- those changes weren't merged to the `v1.16.x` branch.\r\n\r\nHere's my suspicion, currently `ql::datum_t` doesn't have a move constructor, but does have a user-defined destructor which means a move constructor won't be automatically added. There's a `ql::datum_t http_opts_t::url_params` which probably means that `http_opts_t` isn't movable either.\r\n\r\nHowever, I wasn't able to reproduce this error using GCC 4.9."
