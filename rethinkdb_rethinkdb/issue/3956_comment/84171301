      "@orthecreedence we saw Slackware 14.1 had a much newer version of GCC, which will likely work fine. Not sure if upgrading is an option for you?\r\n\r\nWe could theoretically work around this issue in our code, but it would require some testing and wouldn't make it into 2.0. I think it's not worth doing at the moment."
