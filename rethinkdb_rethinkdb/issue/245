        "I'm not satisfied with the output of `rethinkdb --help`:\n\n```\ndr-manhattan:~ michael$ rethinkdb --help\n'rethinkdb' is divided into a number of subcommands:\n\n    'rethinkdb create': prepare files on disk\n    'rethinkdb serve': serve queries and host data\n    'rethinkdb proxy': serve queries but don't host data\n    'rethinkdb admin': access and modify cluster metadata\n    'rethinkdb import': import data from from a file\n\nFor more information, run 'rethinkdb help [subcommand]'.\n```\n\nMy expectation for most command-line tools is that typing `--help` will show all available flags separated by each category. For examples, see `wget --help`, `rsync --help` or `ack --help`.\n\nAlternatively, some tools at least show a usage statement that shows available options concisely. For examples, see `grep --help` or `find --help`.\n\nWe don't have that many command-line flags that we need to require the user to guess which category a particular flag is located in. Guessing games are annoying, and I usually go for Google right away instead. For example, when we chose to restrict network access to localhost by default (requiring the use of `--bind [interface]` or `--bind all`), I ended up finding the appropriate flag from the [cluster setup guide](http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guides/startup/). In fact, many of them are replicated between help topics on subcommands (e.g. `rethinkdb help serve`, `rethinkdb help proxy` and `rethinkdb help import` all have the `--join` flag listed).\n\nI would also note that `rethinkdb help admin` doesn't return anything at all.\n"
