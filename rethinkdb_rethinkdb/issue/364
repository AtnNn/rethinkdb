        "Pros:\r\n\r\n1. Distribution query code goes away\r\n2. CLI split/merge commands go away\r\n3. Shard suggestor code goes away (the user just consistently types a number of shards in every UI)\r\n4. The shards are automagically perfectly balanced without any work\r\n5. The unsharding/region code is a lot simpler (no RxR space nonsense)\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n1. OrderBy is potentially worse (but not by much -- we just merge sort bits from every shard -- considering that secondary indexes require access to every shard, this isn't a biggie)\r\n2. It's a bit of work"
