        "Since a good number of bugs involve specific versions of our clients and server it we generally want people to report those things, along with others, we should make it as easy to do as possible. We already have a bug in this general direction (#41), but that is focused on reporting from the server side, and does not really connect to the github method of reporting (but does not strictly exclude it).\r\n\r\nWhat I am looking for here is something client-side that would give us the following:\r\n- client and server version/build information\r\n- interpeter version\r\n- client and server os versions\r\n\r\nAn example implementation for Python could look like this:\r\n```python\r\npython -m rethinkdb --bug-info --host localhost --port 1234\r\n```\r\nWhich might return:\r\n```\r\nInformation to report when filing a bug on https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/new:\r\nPython driver version: 2.2.0-1\r\nPython version: 2.7.10 (default, Oct 23 2015, 19:19:21) \\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.59.5)]\r\nClient OS: Darwin Kernel Version 15.4.0: Sun Jan  3 21:35:22 PST 2016; root:xnu-3248.40.155~11/RELEASE_X86_64\r\nServer version: rethinkdb 2.2.1-493-g92d8bb (debug) (CLANG 7.0.2 (clang-700.1.81))\r\nServer OS: #129-Ubuntu SMP Wed Sep 9 10:56:06 UTC 2015\r\n```"
