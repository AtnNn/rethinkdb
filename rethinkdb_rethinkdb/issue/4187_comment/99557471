      "That makes sense, thank you for the proposal @marshall007 !\r\n\r\nI wonder\r\na) how much work this would be to implement (do we already have a way to get the length of a given month or year?)\r\nb) if we could find a more general interface for this type of operation. It's like integrating within the given date boundaries over a function that has a peak whenever a day/month/year changes (like a sum of shifted Dirac functions). That's probably not a useful abstraction for ReQL though, not sure.\r\n\r\nPutting into `subsequent` for now for discussion in one of the upcoming release cycles.\r\nHowever I can't promise how quickly we'll have time for it since it seems like a relatively specialized functionality. Might move to `backlog` if it turns out to be difficult."
