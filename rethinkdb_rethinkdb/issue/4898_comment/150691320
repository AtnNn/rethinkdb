      "@mlucy That's a valid point, but I still think it's a lot better to not generate table conflicts in connected clusters.\r\nIf you use a single client you already have these semantics. Only when using multiple clients (to multiple servers I think?) you'll get conflicts at the moment.\r\nI think it's only reasonable to make our \"best effort\" at avoiding table conflicts a little better."
