      "This sounds like it would work well for healthy clusters.  The only concern would be that if you have something weird going on (e.g. a server occasionally disconnecting from some but not all other servers, maybe because it's under load), then programs which automatically create tables would suddenly start getting a lot of table conflicts.  Worse, they probably won't handle these table conflicts well because this edge case would never have showed up in testing when their cluster was healthy, and they may not even know it can happen -- it would be perfectly reasonable for a new user to expect that table creation either succeeds or fails.\r\n"
