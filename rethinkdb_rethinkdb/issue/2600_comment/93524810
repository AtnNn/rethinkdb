      "@xkxx Not yet, sorry.\r\nTo give a bit of background: I think in practice the performance difference will be less than one might expect. A lot of processing time is actually needed for things like query parsing, converting results into JSON responses etc.  While all of that is O(1) for a constant-size point get, the O(log n) btree lookup  as of now is usually not the primary bottleneck. We could maybe get 10-20% more performance out of a hash index, but our main focus for now is on the other 80%."
