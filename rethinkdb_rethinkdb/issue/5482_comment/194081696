      "Thanks for the outputs @artdude543 .\r\n\r\nThis was helpful. The string from `ajax/me` is usually the ID of a server, which should be appearing in `server_status`. However proxies do not appear in `server_status`, and that breaks the web UI.\r\n\r\nI can actually reproduce this now. I'm not quite sure why we haven't noticed this issue before.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, this is working fine on `next`.\r\n\r\nWe'll try try to fix this for the next RethinkDB bug fix release (2.2.6). The work-around is to connect the web UI to one of the non-proxy servers, where it should work fine."
