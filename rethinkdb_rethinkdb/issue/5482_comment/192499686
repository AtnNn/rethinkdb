      "Yeah the data explorer works fine. Just the other pages don't work. I.E. The `Tables` page never loads the databases / tables listing. The Server listing takes around 5/10mins to show anything and then more time to view details about a server. But the main page shows the active graph working fine but the stats take a while to load and sometimes don't load at all.\r\n\r\nHere are the outputs as requested.\r\n\r\n- Table Config: [Output](https://gist.github.com/artdude543/ef7458c8cb86a3540b8c)\r\n- Server Config: [Output](https://gist.github.com/artdude543/2215a1d8de573d835eb1)\r\n- Current Issues: `[]` (No results found)"
