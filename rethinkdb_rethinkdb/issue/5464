        "While it can be useful to e.g. import data as a normal user (or export data with a read-only user), I suggest that we only allow logging in as the `admin` user at first to keep things as simple as possible.\n\nThat would mean that these scripts will need to accept a `password` argument of some sort, or ask for it interactively (probably both should be possible).\nPassing in passwords as command line arguments is problematic on Linux because the password is going to be readable by all connected users (e.g. it will show up in `ps ax`). I've seen some tools who accept a file path instead that they read the password from.\n\nI propose:\n- If none of the below options is given, the scripts try to connect as the `admin` user without a password. If this fails, the script fails (i.e. we don't automatically fall back to `--password`).\n- `--password | -p` Makes the script ask for the admin password interactively.\n- `--password-file <file path>` Loads the admin password from the specified file.\n"
