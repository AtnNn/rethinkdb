        "Using coffeescript for the admin interface limits the amount of contributions you get to the admin interface\r\n\r\nFor example if I wanted to hack on the admin GUI to add some features I would be put off by having to write or read coffeescript. The group of people that work with JavaScript and are willing to contribute to it is simply larger.\r\n\r\nYou may want to consider the trade-off of barrier to contribution vs benefit of coffeescript."
