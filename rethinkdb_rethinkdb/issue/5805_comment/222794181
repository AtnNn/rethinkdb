      "May I ask how you're doing the inserts? Specifically:\r\n* Are you using soft or hard durability (hard durability is the default)?\r\n* Are you calling `insert` with a single document, or are you passing it an array of documents?\r\n* Are you running more than one `insert` at a time, or do you wait for the previous one to complete before issuing the next one?\r\n\r\nI think we know why the drop-off happens at this point, but 1K inserts/s sounds relatively low considering the fast SSD.\r\n\r\nDepending on how you run the inserts (e.g. whether you insert one document at a time vs. multiple, and whether you do it in series or in parallel), the added latency of a disk read - even if it's from a fast SSD - can make a tremendous difference. Even if overall throughput for a higher number of concurrent clients would still be pretty good."
