      "Thanks for the answer. As for other DBMSs, I would normally expect reasonably flat append-only performance when inserting tons of data into a table with no indexes. But then, RethinkDB tables always have a primary index, so perhaps I should not have expected that.\r\n\r\nAs for cache size, I do understand that it's great to keep all data in RAM :-) But is that really the recommended cache size? Again, perhaps my expectations are completely off, but I would have expected to be able to hold indexes and structures in the cache, with most data sitting on disk, which would mean good append-only performance even when not everything fits into the cache.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks, and additional hints in the documentation would be very much appreciated.\r\n"
