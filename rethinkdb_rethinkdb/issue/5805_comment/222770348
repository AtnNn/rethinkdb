      "@jwr The 26 bytes are used in addition to the cache, and can't be configured. The cache comes on top of all other memory requirements, and is used to reduce disk access. This is common in all database management systems. Some rely on the operating system's page cache instead of implementing their own, but it's basically the same thing.\r\n\r\nYou get the best performance as long as the complete data fits into cache. The amount of cache RethinkDB needs to accommodate the whole database is typically somewhere between the raw JSON size of the stored data and the on-disk size.\r\n\r\nIf RethinkDB is the only major thing running on the computer, you can try to maximize it while making sure that you don't exceed your machine's total RAM when including any other components that use the system's memory. For example if you expect everything else on your system to use at most 4 GB, you could set the cache size to 10 GB.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure yet where in our documentation the best place for explaining this would be. I'll think about it. The Architecture FAQ ( http://rethinkdb.com/docs/architecture/ ) might be the obvious location for explaining RethinkDB's cache architecture."
