      "Thank you. I verified again and indeed the huge performance drop happens when the cache fills up \8212\160at 99% I'm getting 1k instead of 10k inserts/s. I'm very glad we know why this happens!\r\n\r\nBut, I didn't expect this and this has important implications \8212 so I now went back and re-read the manual section titled \"Understanding RethinkDB memory requirements\" \8212 and I still don't quite understand what cache size I should reserve. I tried multiplying 26 bytes per block times the number of records (24M), which gives ~600MB. I have 16GB of RAM, so the cache size is likely just under 8GB and I should not be seeing these problems.\r\n\r\nHow can I calculate the required cache size?\r\n"
