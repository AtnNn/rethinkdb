      "Apart from generally reducing RethinkDB's memory footprint, I don't think there is anything specific left in this issue.\r\nFor general memory consumption of a running RethinkDB server, https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2402 is similar and I have more data there. Closing this in favor of #2402."
