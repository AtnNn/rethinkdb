      "@coffeemug, I think what is left in this issue is a different scenario.  The primary concern would be why simply creating a table consumes 16 MB of RAM, but starting a server with the table already created does not.  Some of the stuff described in this issue is probably related to those others, but I don't see anything in those related to this specific problem."
