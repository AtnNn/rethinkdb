      "@Tryneus: Actually that could be a problem in some scenarios. The sindex queues have to be able to absorb every write that goes to the main tree, or they will become the limiting factor (though their writes are a little more efficient, and modify roughly 1/3 of the blocks that the corresponding main btree writes modify).\r\nTo be a bit saver, we could just increase their cache sizes to 2 MB. That would be 16 MB per post-constructing secondary index.\r\nEventually, https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2134 will get rid of those queues altogether."
