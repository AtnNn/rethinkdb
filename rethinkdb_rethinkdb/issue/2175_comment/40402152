      "@coffeemug I didn't test table creation specifically, though I would expect that it does reduce the memory overhead of that.\r\nIt very significantly improves the memory footprint once there's some data in the table and queries are being run.\r\n\r\nThat change is already in 1.12.2 by the way."
