      "Actually, yeah, that would be a side-effect of this change, but it shouldn't be that bad.  `dummy_cache_balancer_t`s are created with a 1 MB cache size, so this change would limit them to about 128 soft-durability blocks (512K) in the throttler - much lower than the previous 4000 (~16 MB), but this would also conserve a lot of memory."
