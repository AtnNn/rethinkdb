      "@pilwon -- unfortunately there is no stability guarantee (beyond testing). Once we implement #1375 users on low memory systems will see improved stability because the server will abort queries that use too much memory, but for now the only way to ensure stability is to increate the amount of memory and test.\r\n\r\nSorry you're running into this . We're working hard on making continuous improvements, but for now please move to a machine with more RAM as a workaround."
