      "12 of the 16 MB are consumed by allocating the two_level_nevershrink_array_t `snapshot_nodes_by_block_id_` in the `cache_t` (1.5 MB per cache_t instance). We could probably reduce its chunk size a bit.\r\nI think this memory is allocated the first time you run either a snapshotted read or a write (as happens during table creation). So if you restart the server and don't run any of those queries, the memory will not be allocated."
