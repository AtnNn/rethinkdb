      "Ok, so after talking about his, here is the plan:\r\n\r\n> The 128MB soft durability buffer limit\r\n\r\nWe should have the soft durability transaction semaphore scale based on cache size.\r\n\r\nI will also modify the import script to use hard durability as an option.\r\n\r\n> Using half of available RAM is too much on systems with less than 2-4GB of space\r\n\r\nWe should change the method for choosing default `--cache-size` to leave at least some amount of RAM (2 GB?) instead of taking half the available.  This should allow for server and query overhead.  There should be a minimum cache size (100 MB?).\r\n\r\nIn addition, we should print a warning if the amount of free memory or the cache size is particularly low.\r\n\r\n> The allocation issue\r\n\r\nThis will require a lot of debugging and possibly re-architecting to address properly.  Unfortunately, this is probably what @pilwon ran into, and it requires the most effort to fix.  For the moment all I can suggest is lowering the `--cache-size` and lowering the number of clients during import.\r\n\r\nAs @coffeemug mentioned, I will take care of the first two points immediately for the 1.12.1 release, the last point will happen later."
