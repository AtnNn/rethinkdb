      "I've been using Mike's rethinkdb-websocket-client for over a year in 2 different production projects and it's been pretty great. \r\n\r\nThere are some issues, like keeping a connection alive and reconnecting after a connection drops, and those are really, _really_ hard to do right, and I feel like eventually Horizon will solve them much better OOTB. For now however, websocket-client/server are much more powerful than Horizon. But as soon as HZ supports plugins and custom commands (and I gather that should be soon), I'm switching, and not looking back :)\r\n\r\n@babakness You might also like to look into https://github.com/tjmehta/rethinkdb-primus which is based on websocket-client/server, but protocol independent."
