      "I just submitted a PR to address object key quoting. Is there an appropriate place for me to add a unit test for this change?\r\n\r\nI think it might be tricky to keep track of `r.expr()` wrapping, since I don't think there's a corresponding protocol term for it. We could always wrap it, but then `.filter({\"year\": 2015}).toString()` becomes an unnecessarily verbose `.filter(r.expr({\"year\": 2015}))`. I'm guessing the right solution is to only wrap a term with `r.expr()` if it's going to be transformed by something else like `r.expr({year: 2015}).merge({\"month\": 10})`."
