      "Ok, just spun up a Rackspace instance.  `r.js` performance seems to be fine in some cases, but I can reproduce the error now.  I am also seeing `error: worker process failed to resynchronize with main process` being logged by the server, which is a pretty big clue.  Will keep investigating."
