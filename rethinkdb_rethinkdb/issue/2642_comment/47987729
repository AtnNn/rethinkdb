      "I've tried just about everything I can think of to try to see if there is something specific about my documents that might cause this. I tried reducing the length of categories from 2 to 1, only having half of the documents have any items inside categories, and I even timed the query with increments of 10 additional documents, ranging from 10 to 100. Here are the results (count of documents, duration of query in data explorer in seconds):\r\n\r\n```\r\n  10 - 1.31\r\n  20 - 1.61\r\n  30 - 2.74\r\n  40 - 4.74\r\n  50 - 6.07\r\n  60 - 12.02\r\n  70 - 17.41\r\n  80 - 15.77\r\n  90 - 15.66\r\n  100 - 20.57\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also removed all other properties from the documents. Let me know if there is anything else I can provide you."
