      "Just tested on `gantz` (OSX 10.9.3), and server time for a similar query was around 300ms.  @brettgriffin, are these machines VMs?  Are you running on rotational drives with a `--cache-size` of 0?  How many cores are they running with?  I don't know enough about your setup to explain a performance difference of 100x.\r\n\r\nI tried this with debug and release mode, even with `--cache-size 0`, and the time was consistently between 200ms and 300ms.  I'll keep running more tests.\r\n\r\n"
