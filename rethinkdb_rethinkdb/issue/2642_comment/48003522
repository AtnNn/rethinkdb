      "Update on what I've found so far:\r\n\r\nThe VM I'm running on runs with `--cores 2` by default.  I'm not sure how tied into the problem this is, but when I run with `--cores 8`, I get much better performance on these queries (by a factor of about 4).\r\n\r\nI am not convinced the `error: worker process failed to resynchronize with main process` is a real problem aside from just a side-effect of poor performance.\r\n\r\nAn individual `r.js` call with a row is taking about 30ms, which means we should be able to complete this query on the order of 3 seconds on this hardware (not stellar performance, there may be more things to look into).  Instead, tests with `--cores 1` and `--cores 2` were taking ~30 and ~25 seconds, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe `r.js` source, which in an ideal world would only be compiled 8 times (once per hash-shard), is in fact being compiled between 250 and 300 times.  This may be due to batching combined with recent changes regarding `env_t` construction with streams, I will look into it tomorrow."
