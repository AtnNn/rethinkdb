      "Got the numbers for how many times `r.js` is compiled in each of the tests I ran, and updated the previous tables with those values.  There appears to be a direct correlation between time taken and number of times compiled.  At the moment, it seems the batch configuration is responsible for this.  I am not sure why having a smaller `max_dur` results in better behavior.\r\n\r\nAlso, I evaluated occurrences of `error: worker process failed to resynchronize with main process`.  This error seems to occur with some probability whenever an extproc is used in this environment (probably things run just slow enough to trip the timeout).  There may be a slight preference for this happening when many extprocs are being waited for (such as in the slower circumstances above)."
