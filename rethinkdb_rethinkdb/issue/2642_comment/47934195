      "@Tryneus The two ubuntu boxes I tested with are Rackspace Cloud Standard VMs with quad core (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 0 @ 2.60GHz with HDDs. One box has 2GB DDR3, another box has 4GB DDR3.\r\n\r\nThe two MacBooks that I test with are not VMs and are quad core Intel Core i7 2.4GHz with SSD and 16GB DDR3.\r\n\r\nLooking through my logs it appears this is logged when I start my rethinkdb service: \r\n\r\n```\r\ninfo: Using cache size of 100 MB\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I would assume that's the cache size you are asking for.\r\n\r\n"
