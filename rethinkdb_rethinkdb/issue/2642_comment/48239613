      "@Tryneus -- I had some trouble parsing that comment, could you paste examples of queries that are and are not fast here?\r\n\r\nIt's odd that the `.coerce_to('array')` after the filter cuts it down.  That suggests that it's actually the batch size itself affecting the speed.  We re-compile the JS function every time it's sent over the network, so if the batch size is really small than we'd be re-compiling the JS function every few rows.  But then the question is why the batch size is usually so small."
