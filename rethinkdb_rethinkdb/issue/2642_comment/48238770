      "Ok, a couple more experiments are pointing to batching.  If I add an `orderBy` before the `filter`, or a `coerceTo('array')` after the filter, it cuts the query time dramatically (approx a factor of 10).\r\n\r\nThis means that if we perform all the `r.js` calls on one core, or if we have an eager aggregator running on the server, something makes it go much faster.  I think this may boil down to the excessive compilation of the `r.js` functions, so I will try to find a way to reduce how often the source gets compiled.\r\n\r\n@mlucy, you're more familiar with the batching code, any comments?"
