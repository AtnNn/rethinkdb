      "Sorry about that, was just adding a placeholder so we don't assign the same TermType value multiple times (like happened thrice in 1.13), and avoid merge conflicts later.  Forgot that we had these errors enabled and I should have tested the build.\r\n\r\nFixed in `next` in commit 64b5b9a, review was 1769."
