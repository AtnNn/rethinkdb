      Just
        "This PR allows you to pass `RegExp` objects to `.match()` instead of strings. Example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.expr(\"abcdefg\").match(\"(?i)a(b.e)|B(c.e)\")\r\nr.expr(\"abcdefg\").match(/a(b.e)|B(c.e)/i)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI realize the `RE2` and JS implementations differ slightly so while this may not work in all cases I think it's a nice convenience for the majority of expressions users are likely to write."
