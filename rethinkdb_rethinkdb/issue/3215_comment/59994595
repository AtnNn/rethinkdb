      "I think it would be fine to rework our `initial_joiner_t` to handle this sort of situation better, and we wouldn't have to modify any existing command-line options.\r\n\r\n#### Existing Behavior\r\n* Evaluate each `--join` directive separately and resolve it to one or many IP addresses - store it as a `peer_address_t`\r\n* Drop any `peer_address_t` that we determine to be ourself\r\n* Attempt connections to all of the resolved IP addresses for each peer\r\n* Wait until we are connected to at least one peer, then wait up to 5 more seconds for connections to other peers\r\n* Log a warning about any `--join` directives that did not succeed\r\n* Continue with initialization\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Behavior\r\n* Construct a set of IP addresses from all of the `--join` directives\r\n* Attempt connections to each IP address in the set\r\n* Drop any IP addresses for which the connection fails because:\r\n  * We are already connected to that peer\r\n  * The connection looped back to ourself\r\n* Wait until we are connected to at least one peer, then wait up to 5 more seconds for connections to other peers\r\n* Log a warning about any IP addresses we could not reach (and the associated `--join` directive, if it was a hostname)\r\n* Continue with initialization\r\n\r\nThis should allow for more network shenanigans than we currently support, as well as simplifying our existing `initial_joiner_t`.  We may need to do some work on the clustering interface to communicate specific errors, though.  Also, we should reword the existing log statement on startup `Attempting connections to %zu peer%s...`."
