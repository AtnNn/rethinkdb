      "Oh, and it would be cool if an implementation of `--join-all` elegantly handled responses containing its own `--canonical-address`. According to my conversation with @AtnNn this morning, the current implementation of `--join` would actually work for my use-case were it not for the fact that it rejects all IPs from a resolved hostname if one of them is `--canonical-address` (logs \"warn: Attempted to join self, peer ignored\" and then discards the entire set of IPs)."
