      "Hmm generally I would expect RethinkDB to resolve a single domain to only a single IP.\r\nIn fact a commonly used technique for load balancing relies on applications behaving that way (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS), and it's pretty standard.\r\n\r\nI generally wouldn't object a special `--join-all`.\r\nThere have however been some concerns lately about the increasing number of command line arguments that we accept.\r\nI might be wrong, but this seems to be a relatively special use case? I think we should keep this in mind in case it comes up more frequently. Since there is a work-around, I would like to put this a little back on our list of priorities though.\r\n\r\nOne thing we have been considering in general is better integration with etcd. I just opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3217 to track that specific aspect in its own issue. Going through DNS as an intermediate step is probably not going to be required anymore once we can use etcd directly."
