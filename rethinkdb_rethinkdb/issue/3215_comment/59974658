      "I think supprting SRV records would be awesome. Thanks for that hint. Especially the fact that they expose port information sounds like it would be the right solution.\r\n\r\nInterpreting multiple host records as multiple independent servers feels a little \"ad hoc\" if that makes sense. (For example it's also not uncommon to have multiple IP addresses for the same machine, in which case one would also have multiple records in the DNS entry but with a very different meaning.) I could be convinced otherwise."
