      "I think this proposal fits well with round-robin dns: a single hostname allows `rethinkdb admin` and client drivers to connect to an instance, and the same hostname can be used to allow the instances to connect to each other.\r\n\r\nI agree that this is a special case and not a priority. However I think having many command line options is a good thing as long as they are consistent. What are the concerns about increasing their number?"
