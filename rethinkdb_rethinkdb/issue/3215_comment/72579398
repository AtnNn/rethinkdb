      "I know this is an old thread, but I'd love to throw in my :+1: bump. \r\n\r\nI use consul.io, and CoreOS -- which means I don't know a priori what my port will be -- but I do know what my DNS resolveable service name is (e.g. rethinkdb-cluster.service.consul). Being able to say \r\n```sh\r\nrethinkdb --canonical-address rethinkdb-cluster.service.consul --join rethinkdb-cluster.service.consul\r\n```\r\nor even (mythically) `--join-all`, would be really awesome!"
