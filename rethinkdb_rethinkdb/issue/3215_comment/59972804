      "Per #3217, I don't think integration with etcd or any such service is the way to go. That whole ecosystem seems to be totally up in the air. Better, IMO, to support SRV records in `--join`. But that too is unnecessary, because the issue is actually really simple: if the domain resolves to multiple IPs, and one of the IPs is the current host, just drop that IP and use the others. Currently the host just drops all the IPs.\r\n\r\nRound robin DNS, in my experience, usually returns multiple IPs, and the round-robinness of it is that the IPs are re-ordered. A round-robin system like this leads to the problem mentioned above: the IPs include the current host, and so none of the IPs get used."
