        "The current algorithm has a flaw; it will sometimes distribute replicas unevenly. For example, suppose that we have three servers, `A`, `B`, and `C`; three shards; and we want to place a director and another replica for each shard. We assign directors as follows:\r\n\r\n`A` | `B` | `C`\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\nShard 1 | Shard 2 | Shard 3\r\n\r\nNow, it's time to assign replicas. We start assigning replicas as follows:\r\n\r\n`A` | `B` | `C`\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\nShard 1 | Shard 2 | Shard 3\r\nShard 2 | Shard 1 |\r\n\r\nWhen it comes time to place the replica for shard 3, we cannot place it on server `C` because server `C` is already the director for shard 3. So we have to place it on server `A` or `B`. So we end up with a server with 3 replicas and a server with only 1 replica, instead of having two replicas on each server."
