      "Hi @mlucy.  This the same documentation I'm reading.\r\n\r\nIt describes how to send a magic number version.  After that, it says \"send [Query] protobufs\", but it does not describe *how* to send them (with a leading size in a little-endian int32).  Then it says \"wait for [Response] protobufs\", but it does not describe how to read them (with a leading size in a little-ending int32).\r\n"
