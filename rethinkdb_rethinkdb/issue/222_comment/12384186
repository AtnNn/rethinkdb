      "`var r = require(\"rethinkdb\")` vs. `var r = require(\"rethinkdb-debug\")`\r\n\r\nOne thing we could do is make the debug version the default for node and have a minified version be the default for distrubtion on the web. And, of course, no matter the default, we can use the minified version ourselves in the web UI."
