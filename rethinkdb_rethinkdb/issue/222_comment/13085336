      "If the maintained version of the driver is CoffeeScript, make `coffee` a devDependency in package.json, add a predeploy script that runs coffee on the source. and include both in the distribution. That way everyone can get at the original source, but there's no runtime dependencee on `coffee` bloating up the deploy.\r\n\r\nIf I were going to do anything with source maps, I'd concentrate on getting them working with the web version of the driver. The CS transpiler on its own generates pretty readable JS."
