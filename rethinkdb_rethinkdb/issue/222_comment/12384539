      "I think debug needs to be default. E.g.:\r\n\r\n`r = require(\"rethinkdb\")` vs `r = require(\"rethinkdb-minified\")`\r\n\r\nAlso, I think shipping a minified version to node is unnecessary. People don't ship minified Python code for example, it's implied that it's the job of a Python compiler to do proper optimizations. I don't see why the same shouldn't hold true for node."
