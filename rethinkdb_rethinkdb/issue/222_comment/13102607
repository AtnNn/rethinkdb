      "Thanks @Raynos, that was a brain fart on my part -- I meant prepublish, not predeploy. Predeploy scripts are almost always a bad idea.\r\n\r\nI disagree that's necessarily a good idea to include the transpiled JS in the package if you want to maintain a single source of truth. Both should be in the published module on npm, but having both JS and CS on github leads to weird issues with PRs being made against the transpiled target rather than the source, and just generally complicates maintenance."
