      "The current plan is to distribute release and debug versions side by side. Mostly I like using the compiler for the purposes of dead code elimination given the amount of library code we pull in. While less important in Node I'd like to remain conscious of page weight, especially considering that this is something loaded by rethinkdb web UI every time even simple administrative tasks need to be performed. Hopefully the debug version will make it easy to develop and debug an application before switching to the release version before deployment."
