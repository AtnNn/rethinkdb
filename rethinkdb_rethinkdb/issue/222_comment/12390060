      "@neumino \"I don't see the point of shipping a non minified version of the driver. The problem now is just that the driver doesn't catch all the errors.\" --> This is an open-source project. Having introspection into the driver is critical for community participation but also critical for anyone that would potentially use this in a production environment. If rethink is ever going to make it at scale, I need to be able to see bottlenecks at the line-level. We can't do that with a minified driver which obfuscates and separates the driver from implementation.\r\n\r\n:+1: on @coffeemug and @raynos comments directly above."
