      "@wmrowan Ideally you have two seperate entry points for node and browser.\r\n\r\nBrowser needs a single script tag that does the correct thing (presumably export a global token)\r\n\r\nFor node you need an entry point that's commonJS compliant and then `require` should just load all the other files.\r\n\r\nDon't make node weird by trying to serve the same file to both node and browsers."
