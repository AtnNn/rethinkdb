      "If you think you want to extend the random function to have continuity-jumps in meaning that are inconsistent with its own behavior and also that of other range-based reql functions, you could just have it error instead of guessing which continuity-jump the user wants.  Also, at some point we're going to want to optimize queries more ruthlessly and could benefit from the guarantee that if r.random(a, b) doesn't error, it won't return a value less than a or greater than or equal to b.  You can't do that if nonsense inputs are handled."
