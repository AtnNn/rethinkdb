      "I think `r.random(x,y)` should work even if `x` is bigger.  It's useful in the (admittedly rare) cases where you don't know which argument is bigger, and it isn't going to be confusing in any other cases.  In general I think that if a syntax is useful and there's only one reasonable interpretation, we should implement that interpretation.  (See also: `str.split(\"\")`.)"
