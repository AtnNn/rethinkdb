      "> As for the semantics, I went with what had been agreed on earlier:\r\n\r\nI don't think we agreed on anything earlier (which is the source of the confusion), but I was definitely proposing integer behavior with arguments:\r\n\r\n> I think that r.random with no arguments should return a random double in the range [0, 1), or r.random with a single integer argument n should generate a random integer in the range [0, n). This is an interface I've seen in other places (e.g. Ruby's rand) which is very useful and intuitive."
