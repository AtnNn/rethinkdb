      "> The second one seems more consistent.\r\n\r\nThere's no strong case between either.\r\n\r\n> Also, why is it so bad to have random(5, 3) work in the integer case?\r\n\r\nThe same reason why you don't want map or filter to do sudden special control flow based on the values they get -- supporting behavior for edge cases makes other stuff complicated.  I already explained one reason, making potential future query optimization simpler or possible.  The other reason is that random(3, 5) works.  Reversed ranges having meaning is usually only desired and desirable when the ranges are closed, not half-open."
