      "I sort of like this interface less than the original one I proposed.  It's more standard for `random(5)` to generate a random integer than a random floating point number.  Also, if you want that behavior you can just write `random()*5`.\r\n\r\nFor example, Ruby's `rand` does this:\r\n```ruby\r\nirb(main):2880:0> rand()\r\n0.9355718335092442\r\nirb(main):2881:0> rand(5)\r\n1\r\nirb(main):2882:0> rand(10...20)\r\n12\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython apparently has separate functions for all three purposes, and Javascript appears to only offer `Math.random`.  I think we should use Ruby's behavior.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug, do you have an opinion on this?"
