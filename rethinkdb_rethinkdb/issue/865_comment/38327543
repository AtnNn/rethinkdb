      "@srh -- what do you think the semantics should be?\r\n\r\nI think not supporting `r.random(n)` is silly; that's how I use random most of the time (and most of the rest of the time I use `r.random()`).  I'd rather drop the two-argument version, but I see no reason to.  The behavior isn't unintuitive at all.\r\n\r\nI can see why switching to a closed right-bound for `random(2, 2)` is confusing; I'd be happy with making that case error.\r\n\r\nMaking `r.random(double:false)` error seems fine to me too.  It's easier to change errors to non-error behavior in the future than the opposite anyway."
