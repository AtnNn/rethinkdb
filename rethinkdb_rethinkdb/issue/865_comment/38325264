      "Unmarking this as settled because this is not settled, you people haven't addressed the problem of how `r.random(2, 2)` should behave without giving an absurd response with no thought put into it.  You can't make the interval change from half-open to closed suddenly on that edge case.  It is simply an error for the user to want to call it that way.  Having `r.random(LIMIT)` pick a number from `[LIMIT, 0)` is also ridiculous.  When the user makes an error, they should get an error, not surprise behavior.  Nobody is going to be inconvenienced by having the left argument go to the left.\r\n\r\n> Errorring would make sense in other languages, but not in ReQL IMO, where people run commands on data they don't necessarily control.\r\n\r\nUh, no, that's exactly where you want to error, where the data is clearly outside the user's expectations."
