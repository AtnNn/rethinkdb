      "I agree with @srh that the order of the arguments matters. I would find it very unexpected to encounter the proposed behaviour, especially if you fix the first argument such as in `r.random(0, x)`. If asked, I would never guess that the result could be negative. It is also weird that that query might return 0 if x is positive, but will never return 0 if x is negative."
