      "I have a couple of thoughts.\r\n\r\nFirstly this review gives me oddly conflicting, cognitive-dissonancy feelings. On the one hand, it's absolutely wonderful to open a github notification and discover that we now have a new delightful command that wasn't planned. On the other hand, I feel a slight combination of irritation and guilt -- irritation because the API didn't go through our regular proposal process, and guilt because the code is already in place and I'd feel guilty asking for a change.\r\n\r\nWith all that being said, @Tryneus (and others) -- please follow the regular proposal process for ReQL changes. Finding new commands is delightful, but having an API review prior to the implementation is really important.\r\n\r\nNow my opinion on the command. I like it a lot. I always hated the whole multiplication thing, I think saying `random(x, y)` and getting a double is a perfectly reasonable, delightful interpretation. That's what I always wanted, and it irritates me to no end when languages/libraries don't do it.\r\n\r\nI don't like the `integer` flag, and I think we should take it out. I'd much prefer `floor`/`ceil`/`round` commands, so the user could say `r.random().round()` and get an integer. I think adding a special integer flag is increasing the sloppiness of the language, and isn't any shorter."
