Sorry about that, this issue was somewhat of a special case.\r\n\r\n@mlucy -- it's your call, you're welcome to incorporate as much or as little of @srh's feedback as you like. Please tell us what you'd like to do, and mark as settled again. Personally, I like the API we agreed on and I think it's very convenient for users."
