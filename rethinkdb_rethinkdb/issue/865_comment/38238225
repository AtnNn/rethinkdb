      "My problem with that is it complicates certain use cases in ReQL.  Say a user has two values in a row that they want a random number between:\r\n`{ a: 1.3, b: 2.5 }`\r\n\r\nIn order to generate the number, they would have to do:\r\n`r.random().mul(r.row(b) - r.row(a)).add(r.row(a))`\r\nInstead of:\r\n`r.random(r.row(a), r.row(b))`\r\n\r\nI don't think we should tie ourselves to the semantics of certain languages, we should do what fits best with ReQL.  This interface is very simple and explicit."
