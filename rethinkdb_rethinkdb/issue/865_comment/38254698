      "Well, it was rather vague on details, so I made the interface more explicit.  In my opinion, explicitness is good both for readability and safety.  If you just want floats all the time, it's a simple matter of dropping the `integer` optarg.  We will then need `floor` and `ceil` to make it usable, though, and push the rounding errors into user space."
