      "@neumino's addition seems reasonable to me. \r\n\r\nI'd hold off on considering this proposal for the time being because I think this is a pretty low priority issue. We've had people ask for random sampling but not for random number generation AFAIK and there's a whole bunch of different random number generation schemes we can add so I think this is going to be a pretty long discussion."
