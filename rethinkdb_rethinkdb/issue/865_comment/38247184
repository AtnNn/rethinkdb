      "The root of the problem is that we don't distinguish integer and floating point types.  Otherwise `random(5)` could give a random integer and `random(5.0)` could give a random float.  (This is what Common Lisp's `random` does.)\r\n\r\nIt's debatable whether expressing `[random_int(5), random_float(5)]` as `[random(5).floor, random(5)]` or `[random()*5, random(5)]` is uglier, but since we don't have `floor` and we do have `*`, I'd prefer the second.  (I'd probably prefer it anyway; generating random integers is much more common than generating random floats in my experience.  You can use them to index into things or skip over a certain number of things or get a random id.  The only times I ever want to generate random floating-point numbers, I want them between 0 and 1.)"
