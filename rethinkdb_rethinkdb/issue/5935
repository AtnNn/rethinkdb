        "One of our nodes repeatedly uses all of it's swap space (~2G) despite having 256G of RAM (200 of which is for rethink cache). Rethink is the only large app running on this box.    A restart of the node releases the swap, but within hours it will happen again.   It does not happen gradually.   It happens during some event and then goes away, but never releases the swap.   e.g.  Currently the server is using 164G out of 252G with 1.8G in swap.\r\n\r\nusing `swapoff -a` does work; but causes the server to be extremely slow while it's happening\r\n\r\nRethink 2.3.4 built from source as per instructions in docs.\r\nUbuntu 14.04.01 on raw hardware (no virtualization)\r\n\r\nWe believe this is related to the index bloat issue we've seen with multi-indexes.  \r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5923\r\n"
