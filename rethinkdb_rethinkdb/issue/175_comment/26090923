      "> What is a step? If I have N steps, does that mean that data went back to the machine in question N times?\r\n\r\nSteps are just things that happen sequentially, they don't correspond to jumps between physical machines. So in the example above each of the `expr` evaluations is a separate step.\r\n\r\n> I think the API should include a bit more metadata. At least a node id for each task, and table name. Without that it would be really hard to tell what's going on.\r\n\r\nI definitely a agree about this. I've engineered things such that it will be a very easy to add fields to profile nodes. And all you have to do is change the function that renders it as a datum to propagate that information back up. Machine and shard information are obvious things to include. Thread might make sense as well. These will be easy to add as they're needed I just haven't gotten around to adding anything more than a simple string.\r\n\r\nThe above applies to the TYPE suggestion as well. I'd have to think a bit more about what TYPE would actually be but we'll definitely have something of that ilk."
