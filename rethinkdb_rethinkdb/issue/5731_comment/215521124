      "The per-table (and per-server) disk usage is currently available through the `r.db('rethinkdb').table('stats')` table. Displaying this information for example on the table and server pages in the web UI sounds like a good idea to me.\r\nWe'll probably also display some other statistics that we are not currently showing in the UI.\r\n\r\nPer-shard disk usage can't be efficiently measured with the way RethinkDB stores shards. Multiple shards for a given table on the same server share the same file and same internal data structures. We could \"fake\" a per-shard usage by dividing the total size of the file proportional to the estimated number of documents in each shard, but I don't think that's a good idea."
