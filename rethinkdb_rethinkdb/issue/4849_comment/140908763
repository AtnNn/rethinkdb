      "We can't do this directly for `get_all`, because your keys might be arrays and we couldn't distinguish a get for a single key `get_all([component1, component2, ...])` from a get for multiple keys `get_all([key1, key2, ...])`.\r\n\r\nApart from `*`, you can use `r.args` for this:\r\n`get_all(r.args([key1, key2, ...]))`\r\n\r\nIn the PHP driver I have a separate `getMultiple([key1, key2, ...])` method, but that's primarily because I'm not using variadic methods in the driver in general. I think adding that to our official drivers would be overkill."
