      "I hadn't thought of how to specify the return type, but perhaps the most general solution would allow the user to define an ```encoder``` and a ```decoder``` to perform arbitrary mappings prior to being parsed/returned by RethinkDB (this could probably stand alone in the client code, but I think it's a common enough recipe that you may want to provide first-class support similar to the encoder/decoder options in Python's JSON module)."
