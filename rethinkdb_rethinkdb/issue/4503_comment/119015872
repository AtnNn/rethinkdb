      "Thanks for the suggestion @brianjpetersen !\r\n\r\nOne problem with this is what to return -- we only have one ReQL time type, so if someone inserted a time using one of these other types and then retrieved the row they'd get back the Python datetime type instead.  Maybe we could solve that by having an optarg to `run` that specifies which Python type to give back for ReQL types?\r\n\r\n@Tryneus, any thoughts?"
