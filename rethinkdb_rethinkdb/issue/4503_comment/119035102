      "I typically use [`moment`](https://github.com/moment/moment/) for date manipulation, so I'd like to see this in the JS driver as well.\r\n\r\nI think I'd prefer to override the serialization/deserialization functions for any pseudo type (similar to what @brianjpetersen suggested) rather than an optarg specific to datetimes."
