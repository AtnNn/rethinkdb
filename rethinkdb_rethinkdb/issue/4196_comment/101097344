      "OK. I think should display whichever state is earliest in the following list: `backfilling`, `waiting_for_quorum`, `waiting_for_primary`, `transitioning`, `ready`, `nothing`. If a replica would display the `nothing` state then we'll simply hide it instead. There's one more state (`disconnected`) but it can never occur in conjunction with any other state, so it doesn't have a meaningful position in the list.\r\n\r\nRationale: `backfilling` has a performance impact so we should display it whenever it's happening. `waiting_for_quorum` can cause another machine to be `waiting_for_primary`, so we should prioritize displaying `waiting_for_quorum` to make it clear why the primary is stuck. `transitioning` is the least informative error condition, so we shouldn't display it at all unless it's the only thing keeping us from being `ready`."
