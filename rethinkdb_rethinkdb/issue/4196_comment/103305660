      "I realize this is an issue about parts of a shard being in multiple states and not wanting to show that as an array because it's confusing, but it might be reasonable to use an array for the state to allow things like `state: [\"backfilling\", \"ready\"]` where we indicate it's ready but may have degraded performance due to backfilling.\r\n\r\nThis allows clients to just look for the presence of the \"ready\" state, rather than have to mirror the logic of the state ordering to determine if a shard is ready. It also means if we add new possible states in the future, the client logic wouldn't need to be updated (i.e. looser coupling to exactly which states we use internally and their ordering)."
