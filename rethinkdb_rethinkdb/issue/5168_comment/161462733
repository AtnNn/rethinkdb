      "The reason it's in a different directory than package is that it's not an autogenerated file, and the gen/ folders are only for autogenerated files (so you can blow them away and know they'll be regenerated). Unfortunately, this clashes with the canonical java folder scheme, and I decided it was more useful for the gen folder to be composed only of generated files than it was useful to have the packages and folders line up 100%.\r\n\r\nIt's possible there's a junit configuration option that would allow it to be moved out of the gen package, I didn't dig too deeply into it. If you manage to separate them cleanly, I'd definitely welcome a PR for it."
