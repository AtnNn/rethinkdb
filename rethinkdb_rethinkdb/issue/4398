        "Some options for a policy:\r\n\r\n1. Pick some minimum versions of major browsers, things may work in other browsers but no guarantees.\r\n  - pros: simple to decide whether to use a feature. Simple to explain the policy to users\r\n  - cons: May be too coarse-grained, d\r\n2. Polyfill and css-prefix where necessary, and avoid features that can't be polyfilled/prefixed\r\n  - pros: some more support than a pure browser version floor\r\n  - cons: this policy has no real hard definition, it's a best-effort kind of thing. Any feature may become a problem and there's nothing to point to to say \"We don't intend to support this\". So it's hard to explain to users.\r\n3. Specify a minimum \"global support\" percentage from caniuse.com for features\r\n  - pros: sort-of empirical, provides a better measurement of impact than browser version\r\n  - cons: Some things have a lot of support on caniuse, but are still in experimental phase and may change\r\n4. Rely on jQuery/less and coffeescript for cross-browser compatibility, and don't use browser features that these tools don't handle themselves.\r\n  - pros: takes some of the burden off of us to think about incompatibilities\r\n  - cons: takes some tools out of our toolbox even if they're eminently reasonable\r\n5. \"Squeaky wheel gets the grease\". This is our default policy at the moment.\r\n  - pros: Doesn't spend time fixing issues no one has complained about yet\r\n  - cons: If the user base ramps up very quickly, we may end up with a large population of of enterprise users locked to older browsers, and have a very large backlog of compatibility issues all at once.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'm guessing we'll go with 5. It might be nice to have a general rule for new features along the lines of 3, so we know we aren't going completely off the rails. I've been roughly going with >90% support on caniuse.com, but it's probably good to have a discussion on it.\r\n\r\nping @mglukhovsky @AtnNn @danielmewes "
