      "Could this be enabled in version 5 per query by sending a magic value for length? Or could a new set of flags in the handshake negotiate format on a per connection basis?\r\n\r\nI was thinking about this from a receiving side if it gets implemented for query responses. The current format has the nice property that I can decode the buffer asynchronously and get the next token without waiting.\r\n\r\nAlso my understanding of the JSON standard is that there could be white space before or after the query representation. That would cause problems if a poorly written encoder gets used and whitespace gets treated as the next token."
