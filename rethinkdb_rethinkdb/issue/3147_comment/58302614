      "`funcall` with no underscores is the name of the function in Common Lisp that the term is mimicking.  (In the future this will go away; we ended up swapping the argument order and calling it `do` in the drivers, and at some point the protobuf file will lose `FUNCALL` and get `DO` in order to reflect that.)  I don't have a strong feeling on what it's called since it's not exposed to users in the official drivers right now.\r\n\r\nRuby currently supports both the protobuf and API forms (e.g. `table.foreach` and `table.for_each` both work).  That was arguably a bad choice, but people may have code using `table.foreach` and we don't want to break it if we can help it."
