      "I think the gained consistency is worth renaming CONCATMAP, ORDERBY, TYPEOF and FOREACH.\r\n\r\nAs @grandquista pointed out driver developers only have to do anything at all if they want to upgrade to a newer version of ql2.proto.\r\n\r\nA quick check of the drivers that we list on http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/ shows that they all explicitly specify the term type for each command, so the required change is also going to be really easy. What I mean by that is that they are not using some automated magic like the Ruby driver where developers would have have to deal with adding/changing aliasing rules to maintain the same API to the outside."
