      "> eojson and to_geojson seem to be the canonical names in the API documentation.\r\n\r\nI will update Lua-ReQL and this PR with those names.\r\n\r\n>  funcall isn't in the API docs, but I would leave it as one word as well.\r\n\r\n`Funcall` looks weird as a class name. I will special case this in my generation code if it can't be changed here.\r\n\r\n>The Ruby driver auto-generates commands based on the protobuf, so people may have code using e.g. r.foreach. We should support all of the old names in the Ruby driver before merging this in. (This can be done by updating @@method_aliases in func.rb.)\r\n\r\nI figured out some of the auto generation on Ruby. However the Ruby documentation uses `r.for_each` and `r.order_by`. I didn't look at other terms or try them in irb. I assumed Ruby was doing something I couldn't understand."
