      "`geojson` and `to_geojson` seem to be the canonical names in the API documentation.  `funcall` isn't in the API docs, but I would leave it as one word as well.\r\n\r\nThe Ruby driver auto-generates commands based on the protobuf, so people may have code using e.g. `r.foreach`.  We should support all of the old names in the Ruby driver before merging this in.  (This can be done by updating `@@method_aliases` in `func.rb`.)"
