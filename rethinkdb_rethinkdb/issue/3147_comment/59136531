      "> This makes more work for the other driver developers. We shouldn't give them more work to do for no reason -- there should be a material benefit to them.\r\n\r\nThis change reduces the number of special cases in a system that generates the ast classes. There is an issue and a small project that indicates a yaml file will be used as a base for future ast generation.\r\n\r\nAs there is no change in numbers mapped to the constants, any project that is being manually updated for new terms shouldn't have to do anything about this change."
