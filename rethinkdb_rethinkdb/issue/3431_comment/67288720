      "I talked to @mdmdmdmd on IRC and we got a bit further. I believe that the version of clang used was likely broken: it was not able to find standard headers such as `map`. \r\n\r\nBuilding with clang should work, but the recommended way to build on Centos is with GCC. @larkost shows how here: https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/499#issuecomment-55141192\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue in favour of that one. We'll update the docs on the website."
