      "@mdmdmdmd have you tried doing the `configure` without the `--static none` flag?\r\nI'm not sure how it interacts with fetched libraries (@AtnNn should that work?).\r\n\r\nAlso: Which branch are you building? `next` or `v1.15.x`? (Edit: never mind, must be one of the 1.15 branches judging from the configure output)"
