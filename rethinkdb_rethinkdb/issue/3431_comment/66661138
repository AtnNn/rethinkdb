      "protobuf 2.3 is too old for RethinkDB. That must have been the cause of your original build error.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to solve the `undefined reference` errors passing the `CXX=clang++` option to `./configure`.\r\n\r\nI will attempt to fix the configure script to make it use the correct CXX and check for the required version of protobuf."
