      "I'm a little confused by the point about JSON.  Our objects only allow strings as keys, for exactly that reason, but since we let people group by numbers and arrays as well (which is really useful) our grouped data format can't be a JSON object.  We instead make it a pseudotype, and it seems reasonable for the Java implementation of the `GROUPED_DATA` pseudotype to be a `HashMap<Object, Object>` -- the driver developer can pick any pseudotype representation they think is useful."
