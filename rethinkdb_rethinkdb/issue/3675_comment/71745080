      "(Also, I think it's false to say that all static languages have this problem.  To represent JSON data in a static language, you already need a type that can be a number, a string, an array, an object, or nil, because otherwise you couldn't represent a list of disparate types (like `[1, 'a'])`).  If you already have this type defined, many static languages will let you use it as a key.  C++ certainly will, as long as you've defined an ordering on it.)"
