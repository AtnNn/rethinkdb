      "A general compression mechanism for field names would take care of this. We should consider that at some point.\r\n\r\nWe could use the information from secondary indexes for generating an implicit \"schema\" (more precisely: A list of field names that exist in many / most of the documents). Once we can compress field names, we can probably do something that works independently of secondary indexes easily though, so that shouldn't be necessary."
