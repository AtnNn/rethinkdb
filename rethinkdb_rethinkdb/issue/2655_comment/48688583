      "1.13.3 has been released.\r\n\r\n1.13.2 failed to compile on certain platforms. @larkost merged a patch. I then scrapped 1.13.2 and released 1.13.3 instead, because some of the packaging scripts assume there are no duplicate versions.\r\n\r\nLet's keep the fixes coming! I'm going to try to have a one click release for 1.14.0"
