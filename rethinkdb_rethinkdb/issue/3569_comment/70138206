      "The current code works in two cases: `uncaughtException` and `SIGINT` (not exit). In all other cases the handlers are either never called, or do not work because that mode only supports synchronous methods.\r\n\r\nHowever, Node.js has added a `beforeExit` handler to their in-development next version (joyent/node/pull/6316 will be v0.12). This does exactly what we want for normal exits. This should hit sometime in the next month or so, so I will be adding that to the current handlers, and when it does I will update our servers to use it. In the mean time we are not losing anything (that does not already not work) by having it in there."
