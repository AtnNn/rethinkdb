      "The code example is https://gist.github.com/al3xandru/68468af57ce108543083\r\n\r\nIndeed I should have checked for the result to see if it is an error prior to returning it. But this makes me wonder if this is not just a limitation of the current API which takes callbacks with a single argument, while the future version will follow the Node.js convention of using `callback(err, result)`."
