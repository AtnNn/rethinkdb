      "Hi @YChebotaev, thank you for the detailed proposal!\r\n\r\nWe were already discussing a similar idea in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2975 .\r\nA big problem with `ensureTable` is that table creation in RethinkDB is not an atomic operation, and as a consequence you can end up with multiple tables of the same name if the term is used on multiple servers in the cluster at the same time.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this as a duplicate, but please feel free to comment more about this in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2975"
