      "Gif of the problem for y'all (easily reproducible by going to the website in the iOS simulator using iPhone 6S+)\r\n\r\n![bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/44855/10713342/5536e456-7a6e-11e5-85b3-cfb7e274a04b.gif)\r\n\r\nI don't think the website repo is open source, so a PR is not possible, but definitely media query related.\r\n\r\nEdit: actually, this happens on the docs site too, which is open source. Therefore, this issue might best live in https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs"
