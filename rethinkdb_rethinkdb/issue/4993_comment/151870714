      "Fantastic. Sorry for no update on this, I was busy trying to track this down and reproduce it. Some notes:\r\n\r\n- This is a bug that _only_ appears on Webkit mobile. No other browser (including Safari 9) will reproduce this, as far as I can tell.\r\n- This is also _not_ due to conflicting media query breakpoints, as far as I can tell. Our breakpoints are automatically generated using [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/).\r\n- The unanswered question is why the site width would cause it to flicker -- the site width would have to be altered in some way for it to flip back and forth. I spent a few hours digging into it, but don't have a minimally reproducible test case yet.\r\n- This flickering was observed by expanding the breakpoint across 5-7 pixels in either direction.\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution was to just move the breakpoint until it stopped flickering on all platforms. \r\n\r\nI'll close this issue for now, but if it appears on any other browser, we'll dig into this. Thanks for your help, everyone."
