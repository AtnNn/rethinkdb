      "@barkerja: could you tell me how? I'm running exactly the same setup (Safari 9.0.1 on OS X 10.11.1), and in responsive design mode (iPhone 6 Plus at 414x736) was unable to see any flickering.\r\n\r\nThe font-size jump makes sense if it's flipping across breakpoints. However, as far as I can tell, the browser should just pick one of breakpoints (the last one defined).\r\n\r\nThe only other thing I could think of was that some UI element (perhaps added via JavaScript) was forcing the browser to recalculate the site width, causing it to move back and forth across the breakpoint. Unfortunately, without the full developer tools on the desktop, it's hard to dig into it further."
