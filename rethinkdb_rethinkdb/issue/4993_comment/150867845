      "chriscates [1:46 AM] \r\nWhat a shame @williamstein The rethinkdb docs look great on my Android (Galaxy S4).\r\nSo maybe it's something wrong with your phone.\r\n\r\nchriscates [1:46 AM]\r\nIf I had an iPhone I'd test it and I would try to fork the code and debug it.\r\n\r\nwilliamstein [2:01 AM] \r\nI'm not sure how to debug it.  Since it happens on both Chrome \8203*and*\8203 Safari on my phone, I doubt it is just my phone.   Also, I just now tested on my wife's iphone 6+ and saw the same behavior.  So it's an issue with iPhone 6 plus (at least).\r\n\r\nbarkerja [2:06 AM] \r\nIt\8217s an issue with the 6+\8217s resolution; probably a media query issue. Media queries that target \8203_normal_\8203 iphone resolutions, will fail on the 6+.\r\n\r\nbarkerja [2:07 AM]\r\nMaybe I\8217ll take a look tonight/tomorrow and provide a PR if I can figure it out (I too have a 6+ and occasionally read the docs/blog on my phone, and it is frustrating).
