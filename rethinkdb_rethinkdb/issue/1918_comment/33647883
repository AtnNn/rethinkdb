      "Hey so it did work, Happy with my upgraded cluster! \r\n\r\nThe only problem I've run into so far is that I'm having problems binding to all ports. Binding to 127.0.0.1 works, but I get a socket-can't-be-created error (and stack dump) when I try and bind to all. \r\n\r\nThat's fine though, safer anyway.\r\n\r\nOh and it's fine, I happen to be using an almost prehistory version of glibc (2.3) -- so I'm not surprised this happened. Was surprised that was the only real requirement from glibc 2.7+ -- I didn't get errors anywhere else"
