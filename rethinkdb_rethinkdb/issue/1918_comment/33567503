      "So I found a workaround (I'm also very unsure if I have done something I really shouldn't):\r\n\r\nthe code that uses pread (which works for me) was guarded by the Mac check... so in pool.hpp I commented out those lines and forced it to define USE_WRITEV as 0...\r\n\r\nFrom what I could tell looking around the codebase, this causes use of a mutex instead of a spinlock? I'm assuming a small performance hit, if I didn't just break everything.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// #ifdef __MACH__\r\n#define USE_WRITEV 0\r\n// #else\r\n// #define USE_WRITEV 1\r\n// #endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild completes without so much as a hiccup if I do this."
