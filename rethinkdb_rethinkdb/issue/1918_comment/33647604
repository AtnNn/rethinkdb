      "@srh will setting `USE_WRITEV` to 0 work on Linux?\r\n\r\n@t3hmrman thanks for the report. I think the best solution would be to check the version of glibc in the configure script, or even better check for the presence of `preadv` and use that to define `USE_WRITEV`. I will not have time to do that myself soon."
