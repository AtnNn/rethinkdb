      "Your proposal doesn't actually work. You can't know what the groups are\r\nwithout exhausting the stream you're grouping. Furthermore how are you\r\nplanning to let people consume these streams? Suppose the stream for group\r\n\"a\" contains the last element of the grouped stream. And the user decides\r\nto consume stream \"a\" first. Do we store the rest of the grouped stream in\r\nmemory during this time?\r\n\r\nI do generally approve of the idea of pushing streams in to the query\r\nlanguage. But it really doesn't help you much here.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, November 26, 2013, Michael Lucy wrote:\r\n\r\n> Also, I think that we should spend longer than the normal 3 day discussion\r\n> period on this.
