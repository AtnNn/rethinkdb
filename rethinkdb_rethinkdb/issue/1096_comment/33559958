      "A brief update:\r\n* Work is proceeding, albeit slowly.\r\n* I think I'm going to try to get rid of the shard/unshard_visitor/eager code duplication vis-a-vis reduce, count, and map.  It will make this issue easier in other ways.\r\n* I think the only way this is going to be done by the release is if I drop support for non-lazy terminal-like terms (e.g. `sample`, `limit`) on grouped streams.  (In other words, you will only be able to get grouped atoms back from the shards.)  This is sort of inconvenient, but I think we'll live."
