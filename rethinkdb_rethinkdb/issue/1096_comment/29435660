      "* I could see that being cool.  Any objections to adding a `multi` optarg?\r\n* In the spec as-written, that would coerce each stream to an array, not the grouped_streams.  So you'd end up with `{group1 => array, group2 => array, ...}`.\r\n* `grouped_atoms` is a mapping from groups to atoms.  Things of the form `{group1 => 1, group2 => \"abc\", ...}`.  (In relation to the above, `grouped_streams.coerce_to(\"array\") -> grouped_atoms`."
