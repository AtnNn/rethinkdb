      "@neumino brought up a couple of independent concerns about the GMR API. Here are two we discussed today:\r\n\r\n* Returning different formats by default in different drivers\r\n* Having to call `ungroup` (or whatever we call it) to operate on the grouped object\r\n\r\nI disagree with both of these concerns. I think the API is really good as is, the alternative would be worse, and good documentation will take care of any remaining questions or issues. I think users will love it.\r\n\r\nI'm prepared to be proven wrong, of course. If people don't like the API, we'll fix it. I would ask to refrain from reopening this discussion so close to the release. We settled on these issues earlier, so now isn't a good time to debate them or reopen closed questions. Let's ship this, see the response, and then decide whether we need to make any course corrections."
