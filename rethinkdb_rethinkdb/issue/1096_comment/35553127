      "I'd like to hear what @coffeemug thinks of this, but I agree that returning a different type in different languages is acceptable -- otherwise more expressive languages end up being dragged down by the common denominator.\r\n\r\nThe API docs / guides should all specify the language being used, and allow switching between languages to provide different code samples to help avoid confusion."
