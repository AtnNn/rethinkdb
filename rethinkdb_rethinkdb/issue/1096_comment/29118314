      "@jdoliner yes, that is what I meant to type.\r\n\r\nMy example with gmr was wrong too, but what I was trying to express is that it is very weird that `x.reduce(f).foo()` means something completely different if `x` is a `grouped_sequence`. When reading and writing `x.reduce(f).foo()` it seems that foo is applied to the result of the reduce, but with the type you are suggesting it will be applied to the result of the gmr. This is similar to the `fimally` argument that rethinkdb's gmr used to have."
