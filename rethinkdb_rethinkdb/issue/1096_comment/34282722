      "This is going slower than I want it to be.  The lazy/eager/sharded code duplication that we left in there for so long is making things more difficult, to the point where I'm seriously considering just ripping it out.\r\n\r\nThe release date is feeling iffy, which if history is any guide means I'm not actually going to make it (or maybe I'll make it but need to spend another week debugging).  I'll see if there's anything else that could be cut to make it go faster.\r\n\r\n@srh, where are you on the cache?  Am I going to be holding up the release?"
