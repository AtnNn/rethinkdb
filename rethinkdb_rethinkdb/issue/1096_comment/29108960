      "Your example with insert makes sense, but it is very unexpected because the sequence isn't the first argument of insert.\r\n\r\nThis makes sense: `(sequence -> sequence) -> grouped_sequence -> grouped_sequence`\r\n\r\nFor your other example, did you mean `(sequence -> T) -> grouped_sequence -> {group: T, ...}` ? It seems very ambiguous to me.\r\n\r\nFor example, `r.group(g).map(m).reduce(r)['group']`. Should that be `gmr(g, m, lambda a b: r(a,b)['group'])` or `gmr(g, m, r)['group']` ?"
