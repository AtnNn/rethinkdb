      "The `multi_group` option sounds cool, I'm strongly in favor of that (though I'd like to sleep on it and think about it a bit more).\r\n\r\nHowever, what do you mean by \"opposed to using `concatMap` for that\"? It's just a query a user can write:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('articles').concatMap(r.row('text').tokenize(...)).group(...).map(...).reduce(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe wouldn't have to implementing anything new for this query to work."
