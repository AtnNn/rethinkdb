      "> I was imagining rather than having `'reduction1' : ..., 'reduction2' : ...` you'd just have `{'reduction' : [reduction_val_1, ...]}` that seems like the cleanest to me.\r\n\r\nThat would be cleaner, but offers the following problem. If we do support naming reductions as described, it would mean that the resulting object would have a different structure depending on whether the reductions are named or not (and what if some reductions are named and some aren't?) SQL dbs do a good job automagically naming grouping/reduction columns, which is really useful in practice. A few people have asked about naming these columns, so I think it's pretty important to figure out a way to do it if we can. (Alternatively, we can drop it from this proposal, implement the rest, and then come back to this question later)\r\n\r\n> Also this is nitpicky but I'd prefer to say that `GROUPEDSTREAM` is an unprintable type rather than an opaque type\r\n\r\nI think we use the term \"opaque type\" elsewhere in the server to describe types that can't be printed, so I just used the same terminology.\r\n\r\n> Also as a side note, the following is valid [...]\r\n\r\nDo you mean you'd like it to be valid or that it follows from the proposal? I think we should disable all coercing of the `GROUPEDSTREAM` type for now. When we implement proper array size limiting, we can allow coercing it to arrays."
