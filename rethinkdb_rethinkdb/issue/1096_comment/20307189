      "The current proposal makes aggregators be opaque, builtin types that cannot be combined or defined by the users. I agree that it's a limitation, but I feel like it's orthogonal to this proposal (i.e. we could always give aggregators a type and make them be composable and user-definable later, and the current proposal would still stand)."
