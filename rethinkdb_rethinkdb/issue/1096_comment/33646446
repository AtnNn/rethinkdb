      "* Probably a lot.  Doing that efficiently would require some re-architecting.  Right now we have non-lazy terminal functions that are passed a stream, and then consume that stream while keeping track of things.  But grouped streams need to be consumed in parallel to be efficient (imagine you start consuming the stream for group `A` but the next million rows you get from the shards are for group `B`).  So we'd need to change some interfaces around so that non-lazy terminal functions are expressed more like the transformations on the shards, and add some logic to consume the grouped streams intelligently in parallel.\r\n* I think we'd step on each other's toes more than anything until the lazy work is done."
