      "@jdoliner -- If we want to return `{group_1: ..., group_2: ...}` from `.group.map.reduce` queries, then returning a stream of objects instead when you group by an index would be a weird API behavior.  If we instead returned an array of groups from `.group.map.reduce` queries, returning a stream of groups would be a very natural analogue.\r\n\r\nI don't want to waste too much time on it, but I think we should talk about it in this issue because it might affect what we want the default return-type of .group.map.reduce to be."
