      "Oh, is `grouped_atoms` just to be able for Python and Ruby to convert them to object like this one?\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  group1: reduction1,\r\n  group2: reduction2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat if the group is an array or an object? I believe Python cannot hash such types (I haven't check ruby).\r\nI would be in favor of just returning\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  group: <group>\r\n  reduction: <reduction>\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHaving the result of a group().map().reduce() return different things in JavaScript/Python/Ruby is a bad idea I think.\r\nIt would make things tricky to translate.\r\n\r\nI'll try to think of another solution."
