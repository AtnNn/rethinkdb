      "I think we should take a serious look at what we can do with the representations of the `grouped_atoms` I think it's actually kinda rare that people will have objects as their grouping elements. And this feature is just so much better when you can look up the reductions using the grouping keys. Letting people rename the reductions is nice and all. But I really think it pales in comparison to getting something like this back:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n> table.group(\"district\").sum(\"points\")\r\n{0: 56, 1: 100, 2: 85}\r\n> table.group(\"district\").sum(\"points\")[0]\r\n56\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that's really a much cleaner solution and being able to access groups using the bracket operator would be so cool. Also @mlucy I believe there's a way we can get this working in python."
