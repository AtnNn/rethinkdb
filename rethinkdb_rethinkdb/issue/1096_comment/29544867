      "A few more thoughts. I think `members`/`group_members` should also accept `true` which would return as many elements as possible (unless they trip the array limit, in which case the query would be aborted). It's nice to let people use the function safely, but many people will think \"man, I'll never have too many elements here but I don't know what a good number should be, why don't they just give me a good default I could use?\"\r\n\r\nAlso, we already have `return_vals` elsewhere, so may be `return_members` is a good name."
