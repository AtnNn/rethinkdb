      "I was imagining rather than having `'reduction1' : ..., 'reduction2' : ...` you'd just have `{'reduction' : [reduction_val_1, ...]}` that seems like the cleanest to me.\r\n\r\nAlso this is nitpicky but I'd prefer to say that `GROUPEDSTREAM` is an unprintable type rather than an opaque type. I'd be mostly in favor of calling it an unspeakable type for the lulz.\r\n\r\nAlso as a side note, the following is valid:\r\n```Python\r\nr.table('foo').group('a', 'b').coerce_to(\"OBJECT\")\r\n```"
