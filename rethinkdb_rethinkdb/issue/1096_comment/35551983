      "@neumino: I think returning different types in different drivers is ok. We already have that problem with times. Some languages don't have a special Time type, and there is no way around having inconsistencies between clients.\r\nWe have been able to avoid this issue in the official drivers so far, but I don't think it's worth maintaining that property at all costs. Eventually we have to accept that different languages just have different capabilities and may require different representations I think."
