      "@jdoliner -- there's actually a reasonable argument to be made that if you do `r.table('posts').groupby(index:'date').avg('score')`, that you should get a stream of `{group:..., reduction:...}` objects rather than an array, because we're grouping by an index and no longer need to scan the whole table before returning the result for the first group.  Maybe we should think about offering that?  It would probably require not doing native coercion by default."
