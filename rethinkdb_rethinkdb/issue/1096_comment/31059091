      "> Having `merge` be polymorphic on array makes the syntax shorter, but not so nicer.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, I know. I just wanted to mention it in case you didn't know about the change.\r\n\r\n> Can we use `group` to aggregate lot of data (like in the case of time series data).\r\n\r\nIf you want to get everything for a given day, you don't want `group`, you want `filter` (or `getAll` if you have an index). The `group` function isn't designed to get every event that happened on a given day, it's designed to let you run an aggregator on every event that happened for a set of given days."
