      "It seems to me that Postgres schemas serve a very different use case than bundles. Schemes are for namespacing and permissions. Bundles would be completely unrelated to namespacing; it would be illegal to have two tables with the same name in two separate bundles, and bundles would be orthogonal to databases. RethinkDB doesn't currently support permissions, but I don't think permissions would be related in any way to bundles either. But I've never worked with Postgres schemas, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something."
