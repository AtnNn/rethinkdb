      "I opened an issue in the docs to add this use case to the cookbook (https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/182).\r\n\r\nI feel like there ought to be a ReQL primitive to make this a lot terser. One solution is described in #375. I'd like to move this to backlog and come back to it when we can spend some time on second-order ReQL polish."
