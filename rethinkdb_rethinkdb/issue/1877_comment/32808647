      "I think @coffeemug's answer is the right way to handle it.  A primitive would be a lot less convoluted, esp. since I don't think it's a particularly rare use case for nosql databases.  That said, like @neumino said, it does quite a lot more than typical `append` commands, but having more richness in ReQL is a good thing.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be better in terms of debugging/maintenance.  It's not immediately obvious that the branch/merge syntax is inserting a new doc, whereas a primitive would make that obvious."
