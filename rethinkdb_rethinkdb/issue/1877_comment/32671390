      "Thanks for the explanation - one quick question:\r\n\r\nIf `add` and `append` take different types, that suggests you need to check the type beforehand.  Which, as I'm sure you can appreciate, is somewhat of a pain when you are writing global code to handle a variety of inputs, particularly since a lot of modern languages are dynamically typed. \r\n\r\nGranted, it's not much work, but it's yet another place where errors can occur.  And we all know that error handling is one place where developers can be, er, extremely lazy...\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be better to have a single command ( say `append` ) that handled both cases internally?  I'm sure there are structural reasons why you are handling things this way, but still....\r\n\r\nPS did figure out the PHP for `merge`, I'll make that more clear."
