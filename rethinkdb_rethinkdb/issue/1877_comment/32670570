      "I leave @danielmewes for the equivalent in PHP for `merge({ doc(\"results\").add(newDoc(\"results\")) })`, I didn't have time to play a lot with the PHP driver.\r\n\r\n`add` and `append` do something similar but take a different type. `add` is basically a `concat` method and take an array as argument while `append` take a value as argument.\r\n\r\nYou can't really merge both because you could have an array of arrays and append an array (not add it).\r\nLike in JavaScript you have `push` and `concat`.\r\n\r\nMongo's `push` is what we call `append` in ReQL and when they use `push` with `each`, it's basically our `add` method."
