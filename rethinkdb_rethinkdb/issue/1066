        "Using RethinkDB fully involves three separate environments, the admin CLI (most management operations), ReQL (most read operations), and the web ui (auto sharding et. al.).\n\nTo reduce this fragmentation we should add a ReQL interpreter to the admin CLI. When we fold the remaining management operations into ReQL we might even replace the admin CLI fully with a ReQL shell. A similar proposal to this would add a wrapper for the JS driver to the admin CLI (#189). This proposal instead proposes an interpreter for \"native\" ReQL code which would have to be defined.\n\nA native ReQL shell would have many advantages:\n- All RethinkDB features would be available in one place. This makes using RethinkDB easier and reduces the fragmentation of our code base.\n- User can manage / play with ReQL without setting up the required environment for a driver or the web ui.\n- ReQL based cluster management scripting would be simpler and more powerful than what admins have to do now. For example, you could trigger  a cluster management operation with ReQL events (see #997).\n- The interpreter would define a canonical ReQL syntax. This:\n  - sets a standard for the \"embedded ReQL\" implementers\n  - provides a uniform way to talk about ReQL code with each other and users\n  - would be beautiful\n- Native ReQL scripting could also help support the future development of ReQL libraries.\n"
