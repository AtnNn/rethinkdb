      "Thanks for the bug report @eden .\r\n\r\nI think we didn't consider the scenario of having a non-deterministic function to sort on when implementing `orderBy`. We make use of the standard library's `std::stable_sort`, and I think that gets into trouble when the comparison isn't behaving consistently, depending on its implementation (which explains why it crashes on Linux and not on Mac).\r\n\r\nAs a work-around, you can do something like this:\r\n```py\r\nr.db('test').table('random').map(r.row.merge({\"rand_ind\": r.random()})).order_by(\"rand_ind\").limit(1).without(\"rand_ind\").run(conn)\r\n```"
