      "@soplakanets it seems like the recommendation would be to merge in the random value in your map then sort on its value in the orderBy making the result of the sort predicate deterministic.\r\n\r\nI think the RethinkDB documentation should be updated to at least call out the degenerate behavior with non-deterministic functions."
