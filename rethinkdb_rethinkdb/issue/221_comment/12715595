      "@wmrowan the easy answer is don't allow early termination of `.each`. If people want early termination they should call `.next` recursively\r\n\r\n`.next` is a pull model, `.each` is a push model. You want to support some kind of pause / resume / early close mechanism for the push model. I say don't, simplify the push model to simply not have that feature.\r\n\r\nIf you want pause / resume / early close use `.next`. Of course with the pull model you will need a `tbl.close()` to indicate releasing resources and \"i am finished\""
