      "@coffeemug \r\n\r\nthe batched pull cursor model can be implemented really nicely using [isaacs/readable-stream][1] which allows you to set high / low level watermarks and pre-emptively pull another batch when you have less then the low watermark number of rows and ensure that you don't buffer more rows then the high watermark in memory.\r\n\r\n@thisandagain thankfully turning pull streams into push streams is trivial to do in userland.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/isaacs/readable-stream"
