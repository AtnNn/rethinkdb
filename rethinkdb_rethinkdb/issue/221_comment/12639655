      "> I suppose contrary to some of @coffeemug 's feedback above I highly prefer having a connection object upon which all subsequent queries are performed.\r\n\r\nI'm probably misunderstanding what you're referring to because I thought we're in agreement on this (dropping an implicit module connection object in the core API). Could you point out specific examples that you dislike?\r\n\r\n> I can't say that I agree with the assertion that the Node.js module should be compromised for the sake of single-line-REPL-y-ness [...] I want to try to suss out the core issue here.\r\n\r\nI talked to @wmrowan about this a few hours ago, and I think we're all in agreement on this. If we do do something for the REPL, it will be an enhancement on top of the API, and won't degrade the quality of the API itself. The browser stuff is crucial to the RethinkDB product (because of the baked in web ui and some more upcoming features), but we will always find a way not to compromise the quality of the node driver because of browser requirements.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for all the help on nailing this down! We'd like to close this issue so we can move on to more interesting things, so we're looking to freeze the API by end of this week. Any more last-minute feedback on specific API decisions above would be really great!\r\n\r\n"
