      "@Raynos -- your feedback on what's confusing is incredibly useful -- we're going to work very hard to overhaul the docs to make all of this much more obvious. If there are other confusing aspects, please please please do share them. We found that when people are confused, they often erroneously assume it's their fault, so we don't always get the information we need to make things more clear."
