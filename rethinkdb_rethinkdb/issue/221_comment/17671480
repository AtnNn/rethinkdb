      "@srh -- I would really appreciate if you didn't reopen this discussion. It's a controversy magnet, and it took *a lot* of effort to settle on an API. Now it's done, it's good enough, it follows de facto conventions, and we have much more important things to focus our energy on (things that are actually showstoppers for people). Entertaining this discussion, even as a matter of intellectual curiosity, would be a major distraction, would get us and our users no tangible benefits, and would be nothing but an exercise in bikeshedding.\r\n\r\nPlease, let the sleeping dogs lie.
