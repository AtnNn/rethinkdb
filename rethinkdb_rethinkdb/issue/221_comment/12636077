      "@wmrowan hij1nx wrote a seperate driver for leveldb ( https://github.com/hij1nx/lev ) designed specifically for REPLs\r\n\r\nYou may want to consider giving up on having one API for both environments. The reasoning for this is because I talked with @hij1nx about lev and he has a whole bunch of hacks for making the REPL be nice to use."
