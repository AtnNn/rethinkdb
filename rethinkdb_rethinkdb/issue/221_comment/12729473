      "@othiym23 has a good point. Using the 0.8 streams API for the push cursor model is a good idea.\r\n\r\nof course if your going to do a 0.8 streams API you need to ensure your lazy. So intercept `.on` and only start pushing values if a `'data'` or `'end'` handler is added. Alternatively support `.resume()` and `.pause()` methods."
