      "@seanhess Sorry... I was just trying my best to be terse in my example. The example you provided is precisely what I'd like to avoid. Providing a single callback makes sense only when you are buffering and returning the entirety of the result set as an array (see the `collect` method).\r\n\r\n@Raynos After looking through the code (and reinforced by @coffeemug 's note) the existing query objects are pull cursors. Thus, it seemed a bit excessive to specify as introducing push cursors would be a major architectural revision rather than simply semantic discussion."
