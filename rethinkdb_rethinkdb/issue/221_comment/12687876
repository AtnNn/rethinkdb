      "I have the following comments:\r\n\r\n1. I don't like `tbl.iter`. It's just a slightly different way to do `tbl.each`. Could we just stick with `tbl.each` style?\r\n2. I don't understand how synchronous `hasNext` works? Could you explain the implementation/interaction between server and client in more detail for this?\r\n3. Using contexts for `query.run()` is really clever, but I'd drop `with` altogether. There's no use case for it -- if someone wants to use a different connection within some context (which is a really rare thing), they can just do `query.run(conn)` (or `conn.run(query)`, depending on what we decide in #256).\r\n4. I'd like to hear what @al3xandru and @neumino think about the context trick. Yay or nay?"
