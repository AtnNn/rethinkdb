      "FYI, in Rethink query objects are batched pull cursors. That is, when you request a row, the driver pulls some constant number of rows from the server, that you can iterate over on the client entirely. As you keep iterating and the client runs out of rows, it pulls more rows from the server. So you as a user don't have to do anything (other than perhaps tune the number of rows being pulled in some advanced scenarios)."
