      "I love the example @thisandagain gave, except for the very last part. Maybe you were suggesting this too, but I don't think you should ONLY support the event pattern for cursors. \r\n\r\nI would much prefer to run most queries callback style. It could easily be optional and also return an EventEmitter. \r\n\r\n    var query = table.filter(lambda).run(function(err, rows) {\r\n \r\n    })\r\n"
