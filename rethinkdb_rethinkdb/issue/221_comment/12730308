      "In real code there never should be an `if (err) throw` there should always be a pass along to parent and either have the error be logged or thrown.\r\n\r\nSomething that's definitely needed is conn proxying.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar conn = r.connect({ host: \"localhost\", port: 28015 })\r\n\r\nconn.table(\"tbl\").run(function (err, cursor) {\r\n  cursor.next(function (err, row) {\r\n    // do stuff\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above would simply return a `conn` object immediately and queue all queries that are being run until it opens. If the connection doesn't open cleanly then `conn.emit(\"error\", err)` and return the `Connect failed to open` error to all queries that are being `.run()`"
