      "Agreed.  I don't have any experience with thinkDB, but unless you want to use nanomsg/SP as a transport for your own application traffic, it would seem instead that you could (or someone could) offer up an interface (say query over REQ/REP or perhaps subscribe to values in the DB over PUB/SUB) using the nanomsg protocols.  This has some advantages over HTTP/REST, but I'm not convinced that they are compelling enough in the general case; definitely probably a lower priority item for this project unless there are some specific consumers needing it."
