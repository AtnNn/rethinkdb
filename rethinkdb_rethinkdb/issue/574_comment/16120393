      "Awesome!\r\n\r\nOn a purely mechanical note, could we stick with ccollab instead of github pull requests?  It sucks to have our code-reviews split between two systems, and github pull requests can't display side-by-side diffs.  (They also have a tendency to blow away comments when you update, which is a cardinal sin for a code-review system as far as I'm concerned.  They also also put the responsibility for the merge (and subsequent post-merge testing) on the reviewer, which I think is backward since the reviewer often knows less about what to test than the author.)"
