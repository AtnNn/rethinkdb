      "What behavior do you think we should have here?\r\n\r\nI think that we should keep the failed assertions in debug mode, because they're incredibly useful.  I could see an argument for not doubling them up when we catch and rethrow, if that's what you're objecting to, but it might be easier to just change the tests to strip out all the failed assertion messages."
