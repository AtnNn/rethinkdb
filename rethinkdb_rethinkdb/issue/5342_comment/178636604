      "We use RethinkDB with Scala. We have an `Id` class:\r\n```case class Id[+T](id: UUID, klass: String)```\r\n`+T`  is covariant type. For example, if we have:\r\n```\r\nclass A\r\nclass B extends A\r\nclass C extennds A\r\n```\r\nSo, `Id[A]` could be `Id[B]` or `Id[C]`.\r\n\r\nIn some of our tables we store `Id` of base type, not concrete. And sometimes we need to understand, what is concrete type of this `Id`. That's why we use this prefixes. For my example above, ids would looks like this:\r\n```\r\nB:082a7808-16cf-4f56-bf07-e2c2f8e248ca\r\nC:bddef1af-2546-4a53-8817-da5199cd3e65\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works perfectly for our needs. But I tested sharding and noticed, that documents distibution across shards is not uniform. `rebalance()` solve this problem, but it's not suitable solution for production."
