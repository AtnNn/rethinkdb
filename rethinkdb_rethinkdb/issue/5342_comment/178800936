      "Another alternative could be using a suffix instead of a prefix:\r\n`86d6444e-c3e6-4131-9a35-dac2a1780af8:User`\r\n\r\nThat way you avoid an impact on the shard distribution.\r\n\r\nAs long as the ratios in how frequent the different prefixes are remains approximately the same over time, I think the issue isn't that big in the first place though. You should run `rebalance` once after inserting a representative sample of these documents, but after that shards should remain approximately balanced."
