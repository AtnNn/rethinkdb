        "We should add back the `durability` opt arg to `tableCreate`. There's no real reason to remove it, and it's strictly better to keep it in terms of backwards compatiblity and convenience I think.\n\nIt was previously removed as part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2876 , but without any special reason as far as I can see. Note that `table_config` still has the durability field (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3066#issuecomment-62468938), so it should be consistent to allow it for `tableCreate` as well.\n\nI know this is super last-minute, and I apologize for not noticing this earlier.\n"
