      "I agree. It's probably not so much of a problem on a production system, where you can easily setup a firewall. But it is a problem on developer machines. Having to set up and administer a firewall on a personal computer is a pain, and really shouldn't be required.\r\n\r\nFor example I must be careful to not have it running on my private notebook when I'm at university, or using my 3G to connect to the Internet etc.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure if this could be a problem for inclusion into e.g. Debian, which have a \"secure by default configuration\" policy. I haven't checked how strongly this is enforced though."
