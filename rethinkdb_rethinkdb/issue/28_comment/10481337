      "So, I currently have it logging which ip addresses it's listening on at startup:\r\n\r\nBy default:\r\n```\r\ninfo: Listening on addresses: 127.0.0.1, 127.0.1.1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr with `--bind all`:\r\n```\r\ninfo: Listening on addresses: 127.0.0.1, 127.0.1.1, 192.168.0.7, 192.168.1.7.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose I could have it reference the `--bind` option, how about this:\r\n```\r\ninfo: Listening on addresses (add more using '--bind'): 127.0.0.1, 127.0.1.1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for closing this, I've taken care of all the code review comments, but it isn't in `next` yet.  I'd like to wait until the revamped heartbeat gets pushed before pushing this, as they touched some of the same code, and I would like not to have to do the same work over again.  In either case, I think we should have both of them taken care of sometime Monday."
