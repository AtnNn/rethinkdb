      "I'll chime in too. I think \"listen\" is pretty clear, and \"bind\" even more so. I strongly suggest that this flag is optional and defaults to localhost, as that's where other services bind (redis, postgres, etc) by default. It would be unexpected to bind to anything other than localhost, at least for me.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps."
