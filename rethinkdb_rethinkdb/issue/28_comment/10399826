      "Ok, so here's how it stands at the moment:\r\n\r\n- The new option is `[--bind (all | <ip address>)]`\r\n- This applies only to `rethinkdb serve` and `rethinkdb proxy`\r\n- `rethinkdb admin` and `rethinkdb import` will only listen on loopback addresses\r\n- This option can be used multiple times\r\n- All loopback addresses are listened on by default.\r\n- Any addresses specified in a `--bind` option must be found, or rethinkdb prints an error and exits.  This applies even if `--bind all` is used\r\n\r\nThe code is done and working in my branch, just awaiting code review now."
