        "In the old Java driver if you could go:\r\n`` \r\n  Object[] keys = { \"a\", \"b\" };\r\n  r.array(keys); \r\n``\r\nyou'd get a list with two elements \"a\" and \"b\".  In the new driver you get a list with a single element, the array containing \"a\" and \"b\".  We were using this for example to generate the argument to table.getAll() which results in our searches not working.  A workaround is to just use Arrays.asList(keys) instead of r.array(keys).  \r\n\r\nThe change if it was intended is fine, but it'd be nice to call it out in the release notes as it's slightly mysterious when things just don't quite work."
