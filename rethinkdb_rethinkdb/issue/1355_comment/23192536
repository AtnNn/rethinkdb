It also fixes one of the issues mentioned in #1349 \r\n\r\nBefore we can merge this, I have to make two additional changes:\r\n\r\n- [x] drop the backup scripts from the rethinkdb server package and from `make install`\r\n- [x] change the error returned by the rethinkdb cli when it can't find the scripts."
