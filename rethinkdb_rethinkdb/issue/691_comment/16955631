      "The docs aren't currently the basis of examples. They just share a similar yaml format, and we run a validator on doc examples (which merely checks that the query compiles). We still have to do a lot of work to actually _run_ the examples, which will take some time. @atnnn -- can you confirm that doc validation is part of the Travis build?"
