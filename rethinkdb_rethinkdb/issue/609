        "`_send_query` currently has two problems:\n1. The first `recv` call tries to get four bytes, but there is no guarantee the network buffer has four bytes. We need to do it in a loop.\n2. The end of the function has a set of `if` statements testing response type. That should be a switch statement, and if it falls through, we should throw an error saying \"unknown response type\" with (hopefully) enough debug information to diagnose the issue.\n\nAssigning to @wmrowan.\n"
