      "The `convert_tests.py` script can output individual lines of code, which is what @chipotle is using to translate a lot of the existing docs examples to java. It's a good point that some of the tests attempt to use several different syntaxes to generate the same underlying query, but I think that's rare enough it could be pulled into a specialized driver test. There are thousands of polyglot tests at this point and hand-translating them is quite a job.\r\n\r\nI don't see a point to auto-translating a test and then putting it back into the yaml file. The polyglot file isn't the final test output, it gets translated again. Ideally there would be one specification for a test intended for all drivers (with language specific tests separated out), and you could use whatever method to generate the specific code for your specific driver (probably with some kind of helper to make the translation easier).\r\n\r\n>  It is significantly tougher to back-track test failures, since we are not going through a computer-generated intermediary.\r\n\r\nIn the java test translation, I output the filename/line number from the yaml file provided by the processPolyglot parser so you can find the original specification. Originally I had the test number with the old yaml parser, which was much less helpful. I also dump out the python version of the test that it was translated from into a comment above the test. That makes it pretty easy to figure out what was wrong and where the issue came from."
