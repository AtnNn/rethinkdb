      "It's about the same amount of work to add the java specializations as it is to just rewrite these entries, and it's more scalable long-term since manipulating python asts is more robust than the translation heuristics used now in the polyglot tests for `cd` entries. Theoretically, this could be used to remove a lot of the ruby specializations as well, since that driver doesn't have r.row either."
