      "This is one of the reasons we have the ability to have different implementations for different languages in the polyglot tests, rather than forcing everything to be auto-translated. Those tests should simply have a `java` entry in the polyglot files. Auto-translating sounds nice, but I don't think it should be hamstringing existing tests."
