      "@neil-rubens -- thanks for the pull request! Could you sign the CLA if you haven't already so we can review the commit? (http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/)\r\n\r\n@Tryneus -- could you please review?\r\n\r\nHere are my overall opinions based on a cursory look:\r\n\r\n- I think having this option is valuable\r\n- Should we make it a default for import/export tools if everyone else already doing it this way? (It sounds like we should)\r\n- If we do make it a default, it makes sense to allow the current behavior with a command line switch. I'd call it `--array`, I think it's a short and clear name.\r\n- If we don't make it a default, I think we should find a better name than `json_doc_per_line` (though nothing comes to mind now)."
