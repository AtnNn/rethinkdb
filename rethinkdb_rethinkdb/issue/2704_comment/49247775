      "@Tryneus thanks for the suggestions (I revised the code accordingly).\r\n\r\n> Technically it isn't a JSON file without being nested in an array (and separated by commas)\r\n\r\nGood point.  I do cringe at this as well; but it seems to be a commonly used format for variety of practical reasons.  \r\n\r\nAfter thinking about it a little bit more, I would prefer not to make it `default` option for json format; since it is not a proper json file.  Moreover json allows for `newline` for the string types; as well as for its own formatting.\r\n\r\nSome options are to make it a new format e.g. `json-rows`, or just make it a `non-default` sub-option of json format.  \r\n\r\n"
