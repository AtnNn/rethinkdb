      "We could possibly do this without adding the option.  As @neil-rubens ran into when implementing this, we currently read a file as a single JSON object when the first non-whitespace character is a `{`.  If any non-whitespace characters come after the closing `}`, we error.\r\n\r\nIt would only be a little more complicated to continue handling single JSON objects until an error occurs.  Technically it isn't a JSON file without being nested in an array (and separated by commas), but I think we can support this without harming anything.  This wouldn't actually enforce one row per line, but I don't see a problem with that.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug, @neil-rubens, opinions?"
