      "> If we don't make it a default, I think we should find a better name than `json_doc_per_line` (though nothing comes to mind now).\r\n\r\nI agree that `json_doc_per_line` is not the best name; but couldn't come up with anything shorter yet sufficiently descriptive.  Another alternative might be `json-rows`.\r\n\r\n> If we do make it a default, it makes sense to allow the current behavior with a command line switch. I'd call it `--array`, I think it's a short and clear name.\r\n\r\n`--array` might be confusing (to the users of mongo) since a similar sounding option `--jsonArray` of \r\n`mongoimport` does somewhat opposite thing [ref](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/program/mongoimport/):\r\n>> `--jsonArray` Accepts the import of data expressed with multiple MongoDB documents within a single JSON array.  \r\n\r\n\r\njust signed the CLA"
