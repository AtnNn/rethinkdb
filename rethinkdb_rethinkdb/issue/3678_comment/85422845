      "EM tends to be of the `EM::Protocols::BlahBlahBlah.connect` mold, which doesn't fit the structure here (It's more like the Tornado driver with a special `.connect` and an otherwise ordinary `.run`).  Celluloid is entirely different and appears to use `.async.whatever`.\r\n\r\nBasically, it's Ruby.  No two groups or projects can agree on any one style ;)"
