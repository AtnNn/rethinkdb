      "> I think `StreamHandler` should definitely work for both streams and cursors.\r\n\r\n:+1: \r\n\r\n> I would be OK with making `StreamHandler` iterate over arrays but evaluate only once on all other atoms.\r\n\r\n:+1: People definitely don't want to write different code to deal with arrays and streams, so I think the StreamHandler should iterate over arrays in the same way as it iterates over streams. I might consider calling it `SequenceHandler` to avoid confusion."
