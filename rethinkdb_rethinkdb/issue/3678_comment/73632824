      "In an offline discussion with @larkost , @coffeemug , @timmaxw and @mlucy , we decided to provide an event-loop integration in 2.0.\r\n\r\nSince EventMachine is the most common one, we should implement support for that first.\r\n\r\n@gchpaco described in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3678#issuecomment-72129095 that we could implement a fiber-based interface and then very easily put an EventMachine API on top of that. If we can re-use the fiber implementation for EventMachine I have no objections to that.\r\n\r\nSo now we just have to come up with the details of our EventMachine (and possibly fiber) API.\r\n\r\n@mlucy since you had recently used some EventMachine framework, maybe you can describe what you think a natural EventMachine API for cursors would look like?"
