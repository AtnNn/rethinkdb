      "I think `StreamHandler` should definitely work for both streams and cursors.  Let's call `ChangeHandler` polish; I think it's really useful but we can always add it later, and it depends on the `note_state` proposal getting done first.\r\n\r\nIf we make `StreamHandler` work for atoms, we have to decide what to do if the atom is an array.  I think most people would expect `r.table('test').order_by(index: 'id')` and `r.table('test').order_by('id')` to be treated the same way even though one returns a stream and one returns an array.  I would be OK with making `StreamHandler` iterate over arrays but evaluate only once on all other atoms."
