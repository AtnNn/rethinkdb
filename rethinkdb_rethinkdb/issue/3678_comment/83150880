      "I'm excited about this :clap: .\r\n\r\n@gchpaco you mentioned earlier that it's customary in the EM world to prefix asynchronous functions with an `a`. Do you think `em_run` is fine or do you think we should rename it to `arun`?\r\n\r\nAs an outsider, I'd prefer `em_run` because it's more explicit about which framework is being used, but for users already familiar with EM things could be different."
