      "Also, while I was working on this I discovered a few problems with the interface we talked about earlier (no way to get errors with the simple interface, the difference between `StreamHandler` and `ChangeHandler` stopped making since once changes worked on both, etc.).  I'm making a few small changes (supporting both arity-1 and arity-2 callbacks so that you can receive an error like in JS for the simple case, have `StreamHandler` and `ChangeHandler` be just `Handler` where the behavior is determined by what functions you define in the subclass, etc.).\r\n\r\nI'm going to write up a short tutorial/guide when I'm done; if after reading it people don't like the changes I'm making to the interface I'd be happy to roll them back (they aren't really the hard part at all)."
