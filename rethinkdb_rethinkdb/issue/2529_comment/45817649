      "Got it boiled down to a case where the throughput is either 5k/s or ~40k/s.\r\nThe setup is as follows:\r\n  2 nodes, let's call them electro and magneto\r\n  A table T on magneto\r\n  A single client, connecting to electro\r\n\r\nThe RethinkDB instance on magneto was started with `-j electro`.\r\n\r\nTo get 5k/s:\r\nKeep the instance on magneto running.\r\n(Re)Start the instance on electro without any argument. magneto will connect to electro after a while.\r\n\r\nTo get 40k/s:\r\nKeep the instance on magneto running.\r\n(Re)Start the instance on electro with the argument `-j magneto`. electro will connect to magneto.\r\n\r\nFor a totally mysterious reason, it appears to matter a lot which node initiates the intra-cluster connection."
