      "> When you measure in the clients, do you ever see the behavior where things hold steady at 6k/s instead of 20k/s?\r\n\r\nYes just got it now. It's very stable between 5000 and 5200 qps (with an occasional 49xx and sometimes higher values < 6000 qps in there).\r\n\r\n![5k ips](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/505365/3238694/2abff480-f0fc-11e3-9c17-b3e41ee0a93f.png)\r\n(the web UI plot matches the measurements of the client)"
