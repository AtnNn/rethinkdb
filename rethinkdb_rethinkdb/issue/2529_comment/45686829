      "The differences are real and can be measured in the client. Just now I had the following:\r\nIt was happily inserting at ~20k inserts/s.\r\nI stopped the client. After a few seconds started it again. The average insertion rate after that was ~2k for about 15 seconds (in the web UI plot I could see that it oscillated between 0k and 5k at a frequency of roughly 1 Hz). Then it suddenly returned to a rate of close to 20k and remained there.\r\n\r\nI've restarted the client three more times after that and it immediately went up to the high rate each time."
