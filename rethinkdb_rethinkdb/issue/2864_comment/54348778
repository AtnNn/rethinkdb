      "> Can we actually tell the difference between \"server down\" and \"server unknown\"? (Presumably a server is unknown if we've never seen it, and down if we've seen it before. Is this future proof?)\r\n\r\nUnder the current system, you would get a \"server down\" issue if there was a server with an entry in the server-semilattices that wasn't connected to the cluster, and a \"server unknown\" issue if there is a table config that refers to a server name that doesn't map to any server. If we get rid of \"permanently removing\" then this would change, but I'm not sure exactly how."
