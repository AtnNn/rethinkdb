      "@neumino -- @timmaxw is still working out the ghosts issue, but if he can implement my API proposal on time, the concept of ghosts will go away entirely. Ghosts appear if you permanently remove a machine and then it reconnects to the cluster, but I think we should drop the notion of permanently removing, and simply do that if you remove a machine from the config. If it then comes back up, it would just silently delete the data (since the user told it not to be responsible for the table anymore). So the whole concept of ghosts would go away.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we can do that on time, though; if we can't, ghost issue will have to stick around for a bit longer."
