      "Here's a rough and incomplete list of issues I can think of off the top of my head:\r\n* A server hasn't been permanently removed, but it isn't accessible either. `type` is `server_inaccessible`, as described above.\r\n* A row in `table_config` mentions a server name for which we can't find a corresponding server. `type` is `table_config_bad_server`. There are additional fields `table_name` (in format `db.table`), `table_uuid`, `server_name`.\r\n* A table doesn't have an accessible director. `type` is `need_director`. (Is this too similar to `server_inaccessible`?)"
