      "@mlucy: I considered that at first. But it's a bit awkward. Currently issues don't have persistent identifiers. So what would we use as the primary key? One option is to generate a primary key from the issue description; i.e. `[\"server_down\", \"foobar\"]`. But this looks a little weird and we would have to be careful to never have two issues with the same primary key."
