      "Could we unmerge it from next and merge into reql_admin?\r\n\r\nThe next release will not include any of this functionality, and I don't think we should delay it, particularly because the web ui changes are currently an engineering bottleneck. In general, we shouldn't merge anything in the reql_admin milestone into next, but into the reql_admin branch."
