      "Overall, I really like the proposal. I'm a bit concerned about the `critical` field. Here was my gut reaction when I first read about it:\r\n\r\n- The world \"critical\" doesn't quite explain what the field means. What's critical? What isn't? As a user, I can't easily tell. Perhaps a more explicit name (e.g. \"availability_loss\") would be better?\r\n- Most importantly, if the field is set to true, we should add information about how/why/where availability is lost, otherwise the field isn't very useful. For example, if server is down, could we add a list of affected tables?\r\n- Can we actually tell the difference between \"server down\" and \"server unknown\"? (Presumably a server is unknown if we've never seen it, and down if we've seen it before. Is this future proof?)"
