      "This has been approved and merged to `reql_admin` as of commit 35101d2.  We still need the Web UI hooked-up, so leaving this issue open.\r\n\r\nNotable changes since the proposal:\r\n\r\n* `time` has been dropped - may be re-added when changefeeds are supported - and we need to build issues as soon as they are detectable rather than on-demand.\r\n* local issue aggregation has been refactored, and local issues will now be combined into one issue (if the errors are the same)\r\n  * `outdated_index` issues are now local issues and will always be combined - there should never be more than one of these\r\n  * `server_down` and `server_ghost` issues are now local issues and will indicate which servers have the connectivity problem (in the `info` fields `affected_servers` and `affected_server_ids`)\r\n  * `log_write` issues are local and will indicate which servers have the same error\r\n* the proposal didn't include `log_write` issues, which will look like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    id: <UUID>,\r\n    type: 'log_write',\r\n    critical: false,\r\n    description: 'The following servers encountered an error ('<STRING>') while writing log statements: <NAMES>.',\r\n    info: {\r\n        servers: [ <STRING>, ... ],\r\n        server_ids: [ <UUID>, ... ],\r\n        message: <STRING>\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* several description strings have been tweaked"
