      "Hi @FransBouma, thanks for the writeup.\r\n\r\nI'm not too familiar with inheritance in schemaless NoSQL databases. When I looked at some of the examples for other DBs, a common thing that they were doing was to query by type. But that sounds like it would be possible by simply storing the inheritance \"path\" in an array, and filtering by that, am I wrong?\r\n\r\nThe other part is of course to properly deserialize objects of various types on the client. This seems like the domain of an ORM. Though when we add native support for https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1016 , we could probably make it support a type hierarchy as well to allow for type-based querying.\r\n\r\nMay I ask which language you are using? My impression is that this is a common practice in C# (and possibly Java?). Is this a common thing in other languages as well?"
