      "> The other part is of course to properly deserialize objects of various types on the client. This seems like the domain of an ORM. \r\n\r\nYou can store whatever document you want as an embedded document of a field Foo in a document of type T, so type information is important _if_ the client supports types (and even JS does these days). Inheritance is but one of the applications of that. \r\n\r\nAnd ORM isn't the domain for this, the client is, I think, but if RethinkDB supports e.g. type queries, the clients can simply build on that. \r\n\r\nI use .NET.
