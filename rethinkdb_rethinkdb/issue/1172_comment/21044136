      "@coffeemug  Driver is working for me, but the only way to get it to install was to install libprotobuf and the dependencies needed for it to work:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get install g++ protobuf-compiler protobuf-c-compiler libprotobuf-dev libv8-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev make libprotoc-dev default-jre libboost-dev\r\n```\r\nIn my case, the driver didn't install at all... I should have kept a log, sorry about that..\r\n\r\n"
