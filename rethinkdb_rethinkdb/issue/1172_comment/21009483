      "@coffeemug No the driver completely failed to install with a fatal error without falling back. The only way for me to get the driver to install was to manually install libprotobuf then npm install rethinkdb again. Ideally, the installation should've printed an error message about missing libprotobuf with a notice about optional fallback.\r\n\r\n@neumino This happens regardless of node >= 0.10.0"
