      "@1N50MN14 -- I think even if you don't install the protobuf dependencies, the driver will work, it just gives a confusing error message during installation.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if you could uninstall the protobuf libraries, rethinkdb driver, and then tried to reinstall it and see if it works despite the error message. (If not, that's ok)\r\n\r\nI'll talk to @atnnn about this tomorrow when he gets back and see what we can do about improving the error message."
