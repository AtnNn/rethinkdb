      "@coffeemug's message was accidentally deleted.\r\n\r\nHere's what we decided to do.\r\n\r\n* npm install rethinkdb will not try to install the optimized protobuf backend. This way new users will never encounter this error.\r\n* For people that want the optimized backend, we'll have separate instructions on installing protobuf-js in a way that works with the rethinkdb driver.\r\n\r\n"
