      "@srh -- I'm a little confused by that section.  It says:\r\n```\r\nBranches that do not have a history in the BTB (see Section 3.4.1, \8220Branch Prediction Optimization\8221) are \r\npredicted using a static prediction algorithm:\r\n\8226 predict unconditional branches to be taken\r\n\8226 predict indirect branches to be NOT taken\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen at the end says:\r\n```\r\nThe Intel Core microarchitecture does not use the static prediction heuristic.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs the \"static prediction heuristic\" the \"static prediction algorithm\" from the first quote?  If not, does that mean that modern Intel CPUs *do* predict that indirect branches are not taken?  If so, then `builtin_expect` would let gcc layout the code so as to cause the correct branch prediction."
