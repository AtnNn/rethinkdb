      "Hmm there's probably still a default about whether a CPU assumes that a conditional jmp is taken if the branch prediction table doesn't have an entry for that jump yet, isn't there?\r\n\r\nI guess `__builtin_expect` might be a bad idea then. Maybe just rewriting the code such that the `crash` is in the `else` case would work? Assuming the guy here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3702903/portable-branch-prediction-hints/3702965#3702965 is right."
