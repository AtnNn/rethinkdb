      "@v3ss0n had you run rethinkdb from a development branch before on that data directory (e.g. one compiled from `next`)?\r\nDoing so can sometimes put the version information and file format in the data in an inconsistent state.\r\nIf this is the case, it should work again if you start with a new data directory as @AtnNn suggested."
