      "@danielmewes and @AtnNn \r\n\r\nI was wrong , it happens on all the versions. (both next and stable) . It happens when it uses  /home/v3ss/rethinkdb_data folder\r\n\r\nafter i deleted /home/v3ss/rethinkdb_data all versions works.\r\n\r\n>@v3ss0n had you run rethinkdb from a development branch before on that data directory (e.g. one compiled from next)?\r\n\r\nyes , i think its the problem.\r\nSo different version of database file format caused it?"
