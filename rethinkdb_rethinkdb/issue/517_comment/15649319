      "All tests except three work. A third of them are unstable, mostly due to timeouts, but some due to possible bugs in rethinkdb. I'll keep fixing what I can and prepare a detailed report of the remaining failures.\r\n\r\nI am also making the integration tests easier to run both locally and on Jenkins. I'll coordinate with @mglukhovsky to get them up on the dashboard."
