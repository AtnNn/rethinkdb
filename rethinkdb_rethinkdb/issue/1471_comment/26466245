      "I took the few hours to implement this because it will simplify the new cache, and because I was curious how well it would work to solve write scalability issues on rotational drives. See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1080#issuecomment-26463195 for the results.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, in my experiments this change improves both latency and throughput even on SSDs (by about 15% for 10 concurrent clients).\r\n\r\nThis is in branch daniel_1471. Code review 982."
