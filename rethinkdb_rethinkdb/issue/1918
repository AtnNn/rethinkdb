        "preadv calls in versions >1.7.3 require glibc 2.7+, unsupported on linux kernel 2.6.16...\r\n\r\nA while back I installed RethinkDB (1.5 and subsequently 1.7.3)... I might as well be the crazy-build-guy at this point, since it seems like most of my problems come from the simple fact that I can't freely update the kernel/packages on the box that I am on freely (so I'm stuck doing user-space installs on 2.6.16 kernel). -- but anyway:\r\n\r\nI found that the preadv/pwritev calls src/arch/io/disk/pool.cc caused my build to fail (glibc version too old). It might be nice to have this noted somewhere, in case someone tries to build with a similarly old version of the kernel/libc.\r\n\r\n(also, I tried the LEGACY_LINUX=1 line in config.mk, did not try to modify the source code to use older versions though -- I will just keep using 1.7.3)\r\n"
