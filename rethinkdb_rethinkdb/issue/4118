        "This came up in the discussion over in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1032#issuecomment-95987309 .\r\n\r\nCurrently we silently swallow errors that occur while evaluating secondary index functions. We should consider adding a `index_errors` field to the return object of write operations. It could have the following format:\r\n```\r\nindex_errors: [{index: \"index_name_a\", error: \"error message\"}, {index: \"index_name_b\", error: \"error message\"}, ...]\r\n````\r\n\r\nI think it should only contain errors that occurred while evaluating the index functions for the *new* value of the changed document, not the ones for the old value (for example doing a `delete` would never have anything in this field)."
