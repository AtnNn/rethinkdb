      "I second this request.\r\n\r\nI've already given a lot of thought to how this might be done. There are a few options, but, at least for prototyping purposes, it should be possible to support purely client side macros. Server support will eventually be needed for proper backtraces and to avoid the need to resend the macro definition over and over.\r\n\r\nWhen we have server support for macros I'd like also like to replace our existing query rewrite system with them and move as many commands as possible to it."
