      "To be clear, I meant ~20 minutes EACH, not for all of the RQL changes put together.  And obviously some of them would take longer, but they all look pretty easy.\r\n\r\nI think that a macro system would be wonderful from the user's perspective, but I'm not sure how much it would help with us writing terms -- as @jdoliner noted, we already basically do this with rewrite rules.\r\n\r\nI think we should do this, but I think:\r\n* We should wait to do it until we're ready to support user-defined macros, since that's where most of the benefit comes from.\r\n* We should do it after the critical RQL improvements we've identified."
