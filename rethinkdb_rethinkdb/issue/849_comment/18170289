      "In the long term, I complete agree that we should implement this system, but the idea of doing it in the short term really worries me. It seems like a project with significant technical risk -- it will probably take 2-4 weeks to get this right, which is 2-4 weeks our users don't get improvements.\r\n\r\nP.S. On second reading, I'm not sure if you guys are suggesting doing the macro system *before* doing critical reql improvements, but in the short term the macro system seems a lot less important to me than fixing many of the reql gotchas people run into."
