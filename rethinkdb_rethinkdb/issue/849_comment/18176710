      "So this issue might really come down to cleaning up cruft. I feel like one of the biggest problems with the query language code is that nobody can understand and modify it except for @mlucy. If we made this system not so hacky then all of our engineers could add features and we could parallelize all of these changes rather than being dependent on a single person. It's generally a really bad idea to have large sections of code that only one person understands but doing with code as critical as the query language just seems to be downright suicidal. This is also creating a really bad feedback loop. @mlucy is the only one who can modify this code, so all of us just ask him to do it which creates more code which is even less understandable to the rest of our engineers."
