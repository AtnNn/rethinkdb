      "Hi @skizzerz , that's a very well written proposal, thank you.\r\nWhat you propose is very similar to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3740 . I'll copy your proposal over to that thread, so we can have everything in one place.\r\n\r\n(also I think I'll close this issue, since rewriting how we internally write ReQL terms is not really on the table at the moment)"
