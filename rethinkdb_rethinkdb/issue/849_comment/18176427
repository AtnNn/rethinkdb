      "I agree with @mlucy on the timing. Until we debut the user facing feature I feel like this mostly falls under the category of hygiene in replacing the current query rewrite system. While not critical, I'd would prefer to clean up the cruft sooner rather than later. There are also enough technical questions outstanding about any user facing macro system that it would be helpful to work out the kinks within an internal prototype first."
