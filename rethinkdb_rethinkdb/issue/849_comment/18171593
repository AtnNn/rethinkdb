      "I can believe that, I just have an knee-jerk (possibly uninformed) negative reaction to this. We've been making architectural changes in hopes of making ReQL improvements for months now, so doing it one more time now worries me. @mlucy says that once the API is decided, he can make most ReQL changes within ~20 minutes, so however much easier things get, from a purely product perspective it doesn't seem worth implementing a macro system before we fix ReQL showstoppers.\r\n\r\nWe should ask @mlucy what he thinks, but if this delays making ReQL fixes by a week or two, I don't think it's worth doing now considering how critical the next few releases will be."
