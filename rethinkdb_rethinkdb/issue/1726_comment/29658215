      "There are other dependencies that can not be `--fetch`ed, such as boost.\r\n\r\nI also believe that the termcap library is available everywhere (often as part of ncurses) and that it is platform-dependent.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to close the issue unless you have a compelling reason to teach the build system how to fetch and build termcap."
