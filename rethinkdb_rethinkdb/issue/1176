        "This is a meta issue to keep track of changes we need to make to the blob code. So far the github issues appear independent, but the design decisions will affect each other and I think we need to think of them together (hence this issue).\n\nHere are the changes I think we'll have to make:\n- Have the blob code cooperate with the buffer cache to not use 4KB of memory for smaller blocks\n- Have the blob code support (if it doesn't already -- @srh, could you comment?) random access without loading the whole blob into memory (for eventually dealing with binary values)\n- Consider a storage format that allows manipulation and access of JSON documents without loading the full blob/document into memory.\n\nWe'll discuss this when the time comes to do #1173, and dropping cJSON.\n"
