      "This is the option that sets the local port used when connecting to a remote peer.  Normally this is assigned by the operating system, and without this option, we can't predict which local port will be used in the tcp connection.  We added this option so we could very precisely block certain paths using `iptables` rules to simulate netsplits for certain tests.\r\n\r\nAs for changing this in the server, it's very easy and will actually simplify code.  I still think we shouldn't expose this option in help printouts, because it's a fairly confusing behavior unless you know stuff about the IP layer, and I'm not sure many users would actually have a use for it."
