      "We're currently implementing `r.map` in such a way that when it is passed a single stream it's evaluated lazily as before. However, when it's passed multiple streams we have to evaluate them in an eager fashion, which is slightly less efficient.\r\n\r\nSince we can't trivially check the arity of a JS function the only option was to always pass the extra index stream, and JS will happily ignore it when it's superfluous. This would mean that every `r.map` which is passed a JS function would be evaluated eagerly though, and we're not willing to accept this performance hit at the moment.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, adding this functionality at a later date won't break backwards compatibility thus we're holding off on it for the moment."
