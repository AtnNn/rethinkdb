      "I think map over multiple sequences pushes too much into map. As stated in the older part of this discussion, this is the usual domain of zip.  If we had zip then you can add optargs for longest sequence, shortest sequence etc and you can accept a variable number of sequences.\r\n\r\nWe should either do Slava's suggestion of implementing collapse and fixing zip, or create some new function with traditional zip's semantics (zap?). I think the former is nicer, since it doesn't double down on using existing terms for surprising things."
