      "Since #3032 is about zipping arrays, is this issue just about iterating over an array?\r\n\r\nIf yes, could we just make map takes a function with two arguments - element and index.\r\nIf you want to enforce order on an array, and want to filter this array while keeping the information about ordering, this is pretty useful (like when you want to filter shards on `table_status` and still want what shards you get back).\r\n\r\nThe current work around with `query.do(function(sequence) { return sequence.indexesOf(function() { return true}).map(function(position) { return sequence(position) )` is quite heavy."
