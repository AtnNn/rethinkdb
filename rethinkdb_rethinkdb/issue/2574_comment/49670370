      "Here is what I think a full proper solution to this would be:\r\n\r\n- Implement `collapse` (#1855) and drop `zip`\r\n- Redefine `zip` to mean what people expect (i.e. take two sequences and zip them into a single sequence)\r\n- Implement a `range` operator (#875)\r\n- At this point one could do this via `seq.zip(r.range(0)).map(...)` (assuming omitting the second argument to `range` gives a lazy infinite range)\r\n- Add a porcelain command (either as an optarg to `map` or a new command `mapWithIndex`) to make this easier for users.\r\n\r\nOf course we don't have to wait for the early steps to do the last step. I'll see if we can get this into the next release."
