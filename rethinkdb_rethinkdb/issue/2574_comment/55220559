      "Err, missed a comment. I wouldn't mind `r.map(tbl1, tbl2){|row1, row2, idx| ...}` too much, but I'd prefer implementing `r.range()` instead (so the equivalent would be `r.map(tbl1, tbl2, r.range()){|row1, row2, idx| ...}`).\r\n\r\nI would be happy with either solution, but I have a slight preference for not allowing an extra index argument like that, and instead implementing `r.range()`. It's not much harder to type, and it seems clearer and cleaner to me. Allowing an extra `idx` argument is a bit too much magic for my taste."
