      "Just as another data point, python has `itertools.starmap` which takes a sequence of tuples and expands them as arguments to the map function (so a sequence of 3-tuples would become 3 arguments to the map function).\r\n\r\nPython also has `enumerate` which takes any sequence and returns a sequence of (index,value) tuples. So `enumerate(['a', 'b'])` becomes `[(0, 'a'), (1, 'b')]`\r\n\r\nI think starmap or enumerate would be kind of special purpose, and having a proper zip would be more generally useful."
