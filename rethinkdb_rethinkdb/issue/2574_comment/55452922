      "> How are you going to figure out a function's arity\r\n\r\nWe need to be able to figure out a function's arity in order to send it to the server correctly anyway.  Otherwise we don't know how many bookkeeping objects to pass to it when generating the ReQL query.\r\n\r\nIn languages where you can't do this, drivers will have to have multiple versions of the function, but those languages tend to already have multiple versions of `map` for this same purpose.  (e.g. OCAML has `map`, `map2`, and `mapi`, so those are the obvious choices that driver would make.)"
