      "Alright.  I can see the appeal of all of the options, and I went back and forth on adding another function vs. making `map` more powerful.  I think we should just make `map` more powerful because it's discoverable enough (people who want to \"map with an index\" will google for that or go to the documentation page on `map` and find it), and because we already have too many commands.  I think collapsing similar commands into one (like what we're trying to do with joins) is usually a good thing.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's easier to add a new command later than to remove one, so if this decision turns out to be wrong it will be easier to fix.\r\n\r\nBasically, I think we should do https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2574#issuecomment-55051269 .\r\n\r\nMarking as settled."
