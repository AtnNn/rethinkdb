      "Alright, an update: since `r.range` is already in and it's not totally trivial to check the arity of a JS function, we're leaving out the version where people pass a function of arity one higher than the number of streams.  If people complain a lot about adding `r.range`, we can put that version back in but since we were on the fence to begin with I would guess we won't."
