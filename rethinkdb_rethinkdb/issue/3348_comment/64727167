      "Indeed I can about double the write query and disk throughput by using a single common file i/o account across all hash shards.\r\nThis sounds like something definitely worth changing. As far as I can see there's no reason for individual write accounts for each cache.\r\n\r\nI think it's still not merging block writes, which would need some additional work (e.g. an extension of the merger serializer to also merge block writes in addition to index writes?)."
