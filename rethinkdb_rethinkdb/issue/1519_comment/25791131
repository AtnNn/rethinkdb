      "@kamilion -- thanks for reporting this (I think we spoke about this on IRC). We're working exclusively on performance and stability now, so this issue will have to wait a little longer, but I agree it doesn't mirror the elegance found elsewhere and should be fixed. Moving to subsequent for now, but will try to resolve soon."
