        "- [x] I have read and agreed to the RethinkDB Contributor License Agreement http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/\n\nThis is a _bunch_ of changes.  You might want to pick and choose between them -- each commit is a stand-alone change, though maybe a couple depend on the previous one.  Some of the commits merely shuffle deck chairs (like pulling stuff out of utils.hpp).  I recommend viewing this pull request commit-by-commit.\n\n(I'm not inclined to do the work to separate this into a bunch of commits and separate pull requests which then get merged together in an arbitrary order, sorry.)\n\nI tested that all the commits compile on Windows.\n\nThis obviates pull request #6162, because it includes that commit.\n\nReal questionable commits:\n- Update OpenSSL version.\n\nI don't know what the deal is there -- is that necessary?  Is it right?  It was necessary to get things compiling on Windows, and seems like the right thing.  (Is it the case that we don't fetch OpenSSL on other platforms?)\n- Forked <blah> off utils.hpp.\n\nHarmless changes, but not very useful in terms of build times.\n- Added home-grown optional, removed boost::optional.\n\nI'm confident in the quality of the code here, but it didn't affect build times much.  (Not compared to a boost::variant removal branch I made.)  Only about 2%.\n- Fragmented datum_stream.hpp\n\nJust touches a lot of lines and kills git blame history.  You might not want this one.  IIRC it made some stuff a lot less necessary to include in everything.\n"
