      "Hi there, Charlie.\r\n\r\nYou can certainly remove this line when compiling for local installation, but we added it to our sources in preparation for making our package dependencies smarter.\r\n\r\nRight now we include libv8-dev as a package dependency since there is not a generically named libv8 package, presumably because something linked against version 3.1.8.22 would not work with a library from version 3.1.9.something.\r\n\r\nThere are other more urgent problems at the moment, but we plan to have automatic build-time generation of the non-dev libv8 dependency in the near future.\r\n\r\nIn the more distant future, we plan to address the more general problem of the Makefile being messy and incomprehensible. I would recommend against putting much effort into patching the existing Makefile since we are likely to rewrite it almost entirely by the 1.3 release.\r\n"
