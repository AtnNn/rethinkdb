      "@jmgao made some formulas to build node, protobuf, and v8, linking against libc++, at https://github.com/jmgao/homebrew-rethinkdb\r\n\r\nEdit: its v8 is out of date.  Use https://github.com/srh/homebrew-rethinkdb instead.\r\n\r\nOne way to get RethinkDB working on OS X is therefore to replace your node, protobuf, and v8 with these respective libraries.  I'm going to make it do this and then link libc++11."
