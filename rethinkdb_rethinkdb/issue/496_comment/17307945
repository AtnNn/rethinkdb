      "Making our own recipes that install to differently-named locations seems like the easiest and best fix.  Then putting those in a ... tap or just having a raw URL in the instructions would do the trick.  (Note that I don't actually know what a tap is.)\r\n\r\nlibc++'s subtly different behavior in its implementations has been helpful by exposing bugs (two so far), and I'd really rather not strip it out of the reference-counting branch -- there's no technical difficulties in the code, but it would take less time to just make working homebrew recipes."
