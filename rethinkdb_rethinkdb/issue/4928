        "For any major analytics system, the [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog) is the best and easiest way to count cardinality. Redis added this feature in version 2.8.9 and has come with a lot of fanfare and use. Personally, that is one of my favorite features of Redis and why I bring it in to the tech stack when building analytics systems. It would be fantastic to have first class support of this algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
