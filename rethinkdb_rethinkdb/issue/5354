        "Looking at [PEP 0492](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#asynchronous-iterators-and-async-for) I'm adding `__aiter__` and `__anext__` to support the following syntax in Python 3.5. \n\nTalked with @Tryneus about the timeout and felt that an infinite timeout would be the best default for both changefeeds and normal queries. Users can use `._get_next(...)` if they want to explicitly set a timeout. \n\n``` python\nconn = await r.connect(\"localhost\", 28015)\nchanges = await r.db(\"python\").table(\"python\").changes()[\"new_val\"].run(conn)\n\n# The changes allow for this async for syntax.\nasync for change in changes:\n    # Work with change\n```\n\nAlso related to rethinkdb/docs#949.\n"
