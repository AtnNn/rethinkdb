All that it does is make writes less sequential, which hurts performance (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3348).\n\nindex_writes are already only ever using one file account (the one from the merger serializer). We should just remove the file account parameter to the index_write and block_writes serializer methods.\n"
