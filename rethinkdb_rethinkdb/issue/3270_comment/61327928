      "More comments from #3064:\r\n\r\n@timmaxw:\r\n> The resources sub-document in server_status seems odd to me. In particular, cache_size_mb feels like it doesn't fit with the others. I suggest that cache_size_mb should be an immutable field on server_config. I also think resources should be renamed. Without cache_size_mb, it's really more like a set of identifiers.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug:\r\n> I agree that the format of server_status could be a lot better. I'll think about it a bit and update that part of the proposal.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug:\r\n> I'd like to leave this up to you, having thought about it more I don't think I have any brilliant insights. (I'll watch this issue, so if red flags come up on whatever proposal we end up on, I'll comment)"
