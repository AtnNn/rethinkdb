      "I forgot to mention: Currently the way we fetch `cache_size_mb` internally is by reading from the directory. So if the server is disconnected, we can't display `cache_size_mb`. This is inconsistent with the other things currently stored in `server_config`. So, even though `cache_size_mb` belongs in `server_config` from a UI point of view, it doesn't work so well implementation-wise."
