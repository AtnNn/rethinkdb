      "Keep in mind that for the Raft release, all server configuration (names, tags, cache size, etc.) will be managed locally on the server. So we'll probably change the behavior of `server_config` at that time. Also we currently implement changes to a server's name and tags by sending a message to the server, which then updates the semilattice."
