      "I would be OK with that. But it might be better to rename the `availability` document, because the `status` field is so important that it's nice to have it at the top level. @coffeemug suggested `connectivity` for the `availability` document, but that seems odd to me because it contains `start_time` and because `connectivity` sounds too much like `network`. Maybe we could come up with a better name; perhaps `uptime`. @coffeemug, what do you think?"
