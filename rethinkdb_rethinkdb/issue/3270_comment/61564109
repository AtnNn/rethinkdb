      "I actually wonder if we should move the `start_time` out of the sub document. We could maybe have a `process` sub document with both `start_time` and `pid` inside?\r\n\r\nOn a different note, I'm also not so sure about the `start_time`, `connect_time`, `disconnect_time` field names. `time_started` was very clear to me, but when I read `start_time` I could believe that it meant the duration the server took to start up.\r\nI know `time_started` seems to be contrary to our general scheme of having the unit at the end, but then again \"time\" isn't actually a unit."
