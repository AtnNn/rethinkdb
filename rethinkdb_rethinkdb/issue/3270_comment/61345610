      "> I suggest that cache_size_mb should be an immutable field on server_config.\r\n\r\nThat would be nice because we could later expose https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3166 through that.\r\n\r\nHow about we put `pid` on the top level and rename the object containing the remaining fields (`host` and the various ports) to `network`?"
