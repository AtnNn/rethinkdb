      "@unit3 -- does `r.table('test').nth(0)` hang?\r\n\r\nIt might be that Web UI is re-using a query token that's already in the stream cache somehow, which would cause stream queries but not datum queries to hang.\r\n\r\nAlso, @neumino -- what happens right now when an HTTP connection times out while a request is outstanding?  Also, when do we time out these days?"
