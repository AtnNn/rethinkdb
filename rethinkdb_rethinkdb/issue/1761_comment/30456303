      "@unit3 -- thanks for submitting this bug report! We're working on performance and stability now, so it's a very opportune time. We have our hands full right now, and will work to reproduce and fix this issue as soon as we can.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, could you connect to the offending node via a client driver (instead of the web UI) and run the limit query? This would help figure out if it's a web UI issue or the issue with the node."
