      "Update on this, feels related but isn't exactly the same: after doing a bunch of resharding up and down, now I can't run table('test').delete() and have it complete immediately, it stalls for hours before it actually runs and deletes rows. As before, it works from Python to that host, or from other hosts in the cluster.\r\n\r\nAlso, when reloading the hung dataexplorer page, I got an ajax overlay window saying\r\n\r\n\"You have been disconnected from the server\r\n\r\nThe connection to the server has been lost. The server may be under heavy load.\r\n\r\nTrying to reconnect ..\"\r\n"
