      "Update: since I created the new \"test2\" table, queries have started working again against test, including r.table('test').nth(0). So maybe there was something cached about table states on this system that was incorrect, and changing table information sorted it out? Not really sure, but thankfully not a super severe bug.\r\n\r\nI'm going to re-insert data into this table, and attempt to reproduce the problem via the full table delete statement again."
