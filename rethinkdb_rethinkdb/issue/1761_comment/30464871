      "Hum, so a HTTP connection shouldn't time out with the data explorer.\r\nWe open the connection, and then run `r.expr(1)` every five minutes.\r\n\r\nBut if somehow the HTTP connection still times out, I don't really know what the server is going to do. I think it's going to abort the query -- but that's just a vague souvenir from a talk I had with Bill.\r\n"
