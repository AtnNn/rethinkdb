      "So @unit3 can run queries like `r.expr(1)`, `r.db(\"test\").info()` and it works fine.\r\nIt's only when he hit the table \"test\" that the query hangs.\r\nNo error in the JavaScript console too, so I'm not sure it's related to the web UI.\r\n\r\n@unit3, sorry to bother you again. Could you try with another browser? Firefox or Chrome? And see what happens?"
