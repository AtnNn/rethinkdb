      "Thanks for opening a feature request for this @lprhodes .\r\n\r\nThis will actually be covered by https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2855 . There are still a few open questions about that feature, but it should at least be sufficient to implement efficient pagination with `getIntersecting`.\r\nAnother possible option for allowing a combination of `between` and `getIntersecting` would be https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/809 .\r\n\r\nDo you think I can close this as a duplicate?"
