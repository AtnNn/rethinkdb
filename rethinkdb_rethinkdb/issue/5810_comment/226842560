      "@danielmewes your last suggestions looks good, though I might change them a little to give more options to the user. I see that you already have a [.conf file](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/config-file/) available, so the concept would be to simply add extra settings for the Service inside the same file, no need to create 2 files that basically do similar things. \r\n\r\n**Option 1, with Config file**, also note that the config file should have higher priority over any other flags that might be passed through the command line. \r\n```bash\r\nrethinkdb.exe --install-service ServiceName --config-file ConfigFilePath\r\nrethinkdb.exe --remove-service ServiceName\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Option 2, without Config file**, that would be 0+ flags passed in\r\n```bash\r\nrethinkdb.exe --install-service ServiceName --flag1 --flag2\r\nrethinkdb.exe --remove-service ServiceName\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's more flexible to have both options working. I also see that you already have a [.conf file](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/config-file/) available, so the concept would be to simply add these extra Service settings inside the same config file, no need to create 2 files that basically do similar things. \r\n"
