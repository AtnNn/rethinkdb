      "I'm not sure there's a need for one. For me, I prefer a zip file as the way it's distributed now. Or at least keep this zip file option available, or `installer.exe /unzip c:\\here`. My opinion might not mean much in the grand scheme of things, but I'd hope to point out:\r\n\r\nProblems with installers:\r\n* Adds friction\r\n* Programs would normally install to `C:\\Program Files\\`. IIRC, the one \"micro$oft\" way would be to put only **program files & read-only data** in `C:\\Program Files\\`.... so `rethinkdb_data` files would have to go someplace else. But where? Maybe some default location like `C:\\ProgramData` that is only shown in **Windows Explorer** when \"show hidden files & folders\" is configured in some obscure *View > Folder Options* setting dialog box. :crying_cat_face: \r\n* Multiple installations become a problem too. What does one do with MSI database entry in `appwiz.cpl` when multiple instances are installed? Does it uninstall the last instance that was installed? Or is a dialog box going to pop up and ask for which instance to uninstall?\r\n* How do we handle updates to already installed instances?\r\n* And what about that proxy mode? And multiple instances of proxy mode things?\r\n* And about a custom UI for all the config flags? Join to/from cluster? Bind all/IP address?\r\n\r\n:8ball: :8ball: :8ball: \r\n\r\nThe only advantage I can think of for a MSI like installer is:\r\n* Some adminy/MSI deployment scenario thing. But honestly, could just as easily be done with a custom PowerShell setup script.\r\n\r\nI would try to keep it simple, maybe something like this:\r\n```\r\nrethinkdb.exe --install --myflags \r\nrethinkdb.exe --uninstall --myflags \r\n```\r\nThe `--install` and `--uninstall` flags are all that's needed to setup a **Windows Service** in the SCM (Service Control Manager) in the current directory. Update? Boom :boom:. Replace the `.exe`. Need to roll back? Boom :boom:. Replace the `.exe`. Migrate? just copy `rethinkdb.exe`, no need to keep around the associated installer for that specific version. Uninstall? Boom :boom:. Delete the directory (and if you want to remove from SCM **without the `rethinkdb.exe`**, that's completely cool too `sc delete <service name>` from the command prompt). No lingering footprint on the system.\r\n\r\n---------\r\nIn contrast, w.r.t MSI installers:\r\n> Imagine if we tried to uninstall RethinkDB with an MSI entry (and we accidentally deleted an install folder), the MSI installer would go **bat- - - -** crazy complaining that you deleted directory that is needed to complete the uninstall (lolz), so then uninstall would fail and a pesky & broken **RethinkDB** MSI entry would be present inside `appwiz.cpl`. So, to back out of your mistake, you'd need to ***install*** RethinkDB via MSI first (to recreate the missing files that were deleted), then run the `appwizl.cpl` ***remove program*** to finally ***uninstall*** RethinkDB properly.\r\n\r\n> Or, use an **nirsoft** tool to edit the MSI database directly to remove the pesky **RethinkDB** MSI entry.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nRethinkDB is simple. One `.zip/.exe` file and we get a cool database without any drama. This is really nice. Since we are not installing OS-level drivers or anything fancy, I would maybe hold out against a GUI/MSI like installer until one is ***really*** needed. I dunno about the documentation shortcut either. Presumably, the documentation is *where* they got the installer from. \175\\_(\12484)_/\175\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents. :money_with_wings: \r\n\r\nBrian :sunglasses: "
