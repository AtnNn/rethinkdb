      "I like the idea of a configuration file. Makes lots of sense. :+1: The most near and dear to my heart is a drama-free `.zip+.exe` file or some (`installer.exe /extract`) option to extract the `rethinkdb.exe` executable.\r\n\r\n*@bchavez just feels jaded when it comes to installers that integrate with M$ Windowz.* :scream_cat:\r\n\r\n:running: :sunrise_over_mountains: [***And I ran.
