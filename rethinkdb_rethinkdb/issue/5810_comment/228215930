      "Windows service compatibility with `install-service` and `remove-service` commands is now implemented in the branch daniel_windows_service and in internal code review 3674.\r\n\r\nA configuration file is required, to simplify argument parsing (otherwise we would have to distinguish arguments that apply to the `install-service` command itself and arguments that apply to the rethinkdb server, which would be more annoying)."
