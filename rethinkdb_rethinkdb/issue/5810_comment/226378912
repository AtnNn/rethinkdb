      "I am also not so much interested in the MSI installer but seriously can't wait to see the Service install. The idea of starting a Service instead of always having a shell open just for RethinkDB would be so much more pleasant :)\r\n\r\nI also agree on the `rethinkdb.exe --install ServiceName --myFlags`, this looks great.\r\n\r\nTo give more broad ideas, you can also take a look at how the [other NoSQL...](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/#configure-a-windows-service-for-mongodb-community-edition) have implemented Windows Services. When I tried them, it was super easy to setup and their doc explains it very well. Their way of having an optional config file (instead of retyping the `--allFlags` every time) is also a very nice feature. I personally prefer the config file instead of the flags, since it becomes super easy to copy the exact same config to another Windows machine afterward.\r\n\r\nFinally, you should probably use `--remove` instead of `--uninstall` since the word uninstall is generally use for uninstalling an App on Windows. So it might look like this instead:\r\n```bash\r\nrethinkdb.exe --install ServiceName --myflags \r\nrethinkdb.exe --remove --myflags \r\n```"
