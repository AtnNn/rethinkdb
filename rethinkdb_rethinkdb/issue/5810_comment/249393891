      "It looks like `install_windows_service` in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/e9658bb687d4ef8f546db5ced082938d91174956/src/clustering/administration/main/windows_service.cc#L127 does very little more than just install the service, thus it should be possible to do so via `sc create`. Make sure it has the right name though if you want to be able to remove it via `rethinkdb.exe`."
