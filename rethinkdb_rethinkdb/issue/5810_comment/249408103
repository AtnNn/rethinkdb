      "Thanks, @danielmewes. Typically we have other `sc` work like `sc config` to set the user identity and `sc failure` to setup actions in the case of a process crash. The compelling reason, maybe, is we wouldn't want the service to start until we've configured the identity under which it'll run.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing `run-service` causes rethinkdb to handle stop/shutdown/interrogate events. If you want the process to detect if it's running as a service without the command line flag, you can query this with [GetTokenInformation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2668851/how-do-i-detect-that-my-application-is-running-as-service-or-in-an-interactive-s). I apologise if you've already considered this. Thanks again."
