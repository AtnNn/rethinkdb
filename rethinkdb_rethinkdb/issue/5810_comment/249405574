      "@judwhite Note that you'll have to pass special arguments to `rethinkdb.exe` in the service though to make it behave as a Windows service. Specifically it has to be run as `rethinkdb.exe run-service <server arguments>`. I'd definitely recommend using the `rethinkdb.exe install-service` option, unless you have a strong reason for using `sc create` instead."
