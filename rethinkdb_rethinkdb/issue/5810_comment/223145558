      "Thanks for your take on this @bchavez .\r\n\r\nWith an installer, we would still have a way for running `rethinkdb.exe` manually. Either we could add it to the PATH, or just document where it gets installed so that you can add it to the PATH manually.\r\n\r\nGood question about where to store the database file and configuration for a global instance. If it was bound to a user, we could put it into \"Application Data\" or similar. But it isn't really.\r\nI wonder how other databases on Windows do it (for example MS SQL Server).\r\n\r\nThe main benefit of providing an installer is that it's likely more familiar for new users. We can also bundle it up with some useful \"getting started\" links to documentation that we can add to the start menu.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting option for distribution is https://chocolatey.org/ by the way. I haven't looked into the details of that yet."
