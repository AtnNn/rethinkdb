      "For iOS, there's a chance that you can use this Objective C driver https://github.com/dparnell/rethink-db-client , but I don't understand the iOS environment very well.\r\n\r\nUsually an iOS or Android application would not access a RethinkDB server directly, but instead would connect to an application-specific backend that you implement, which in turn would talk to RethinkDB. \r\n\r\nThis is important because a RethinkDB server cannot be exposed publicly on the Internet without severely risking the security of the server and the safety of the stored data.\r\n\r\nWe're working on a new backend and API that's aimed specifically at writing frontend applications without having to deal with custom backend code. It's going to be called Horizon, and there's some info on it in this comment: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3711#issuecomment-151639571\r\n\r\nThe very first release of Horizon is going to target browser-based web applications, but support for mobile applications should follow soon. I think Horizon might be closer to what you're looking for, depending on your requirements."
