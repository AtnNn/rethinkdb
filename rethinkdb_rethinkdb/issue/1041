        "Every json_stream_t stream is expected to return a scoped_cJSON_t. For many operations (most prominently filter I think?) that means that the operation gets a cJSON object, has to convert it into a datum_t, and then convert it back into a cJSON.\n\nIt is probably a good idea to avoid this back-and-forth conversion, as especially the conversion to a datum_t is very costly.\n\nI yet have to confirm that this specific behaviour is a bottleneck in any query, so I don't think we should give it a high priority just yet.\n"
