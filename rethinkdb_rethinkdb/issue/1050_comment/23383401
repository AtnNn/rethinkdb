      "Fixes to make our code python 3 compatible are currently in review 885 by @atnnn. These changes were made in such a way as to maintain compatibility with python 2.7. For existing users there should be no change in functionality. There is more work to be done on this however; there is still the issue of the compatibility of google's protobuf library.\r\n\r\nHere's the strategy we've chosen to pursue. We'll post instructions on rethinkdb.com detailing how to install the driver from source for users who wish to have a python3 compatible version of the driver. This will involve several steps.\r\n\r\n1) download @malthe's fork of the google library from https://github.com/malthe/google-protobuf\r\n2) build and install protoc from the fork\r\n3) build and install the python protobuf package from the fork\r\n4) build and install the rethinkdb driver from source\r\n\r\nInstalling protoc before (re)building both the protobuf package and rethinkdb is necessary as they both contain generated python code which must be compatible with python3.\r\n\r\nWhile this process is not ideal, it's similar to steps users on other \"unusual\" platforms have to take to get rethinkdb working. It's also a lot easier than other potential options for providing python3 compatible protobuf support for our users. Lastly, this approach is future proof, as soon as google updates their library with python3 support all this goes away and users can simply install our existing package with pip."
