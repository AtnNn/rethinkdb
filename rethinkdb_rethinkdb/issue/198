I'd love to see support for the equivalent of mongo's $all, $in and $nin operators.\r\n\r\ne.g. given a table with the following document:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  name: 'Me',\r\n  favorite_colors: [ 'red', 'green', 'blue' ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to do:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndb.table('users').filter(function(user) {\r\n  return user('favorite_colors').in(['red','green'])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr ideally something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndb.table('users').filter({'favorite_colors.$in': ['red', 'green']})\r\n```"
