        "Querying embedded arrays is cumbersome right now. I'd love to see support for the equivalent of mongo's $all, $in and $nin operators.\n\ne.g. given a table with the following document:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  name: 'Me',\n  favorite_colors: [ 'red', 'green', 'blue' ]\n}\n```\n\nI'd like to be able to do:\n\n``` javascript\ndb.table('users').filter(function(user) {\n  return user('favorite_colors').in(['red','green'])\n}\n```\n\nOr ideally something along the lines of:\n\n``` javascript\ndb.table('users').filter({'favorite_colors.$in': ['red', 'green']})\n```\n"
