      "I don't believe this is a bug.  `get_all` on the primary key returns an array of one element rather than a stream because the primary key is guaranteed to be unique, and thus there's only one element to retrieve.  This was the case before, as well, but because we were combining both stream selections and array selections into just \"selections\" in previous versions, the server would see the type \"selection\" and pretend that the array was a lazy stream."
