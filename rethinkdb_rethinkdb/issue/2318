        "Users often run into situations where they need to perform array operations on sequences larger than 100k elements (see #2303).\n\nI think we should make the array size limit configurable (by adding an `array_size` optarg that can be passed to `run` or to relevant individual commands -- we can start with `order_by` and `distinct` (the two biggest culprits) and go from there).\n\nUsers still wouldn't be able to write more than 100k element arrays even if the custom array limit is higher.\n\nMoving to polish.\n"
