        "I had two servers.\r\nI created a table on server 1 with a few 100k documents, some small (~50 bytes) and some larger (few KB). Then I added a second server and replicated the table to it.\r\nWhile backfilling was still running, I started inserting a few more of the documents.\r\n\r\nThis crash happened after a few minutes on the server that was receiving the backfills:\r\n```\r\nerror: Error in src/rdb_protocol/store_receive_backfill.cc at line 196:\r\nerror: Guarantee failed: [res == archive_result_t::SUCCESS] \r\nerror: Backtrace:\r\nerror: Thu May 14 12:24:17 2015\r\n       \r\n       1: format_backtrace(bool) at backtrace.cc:214\r\n       2: report_fatal_error(char const*, int, char const*, ...) at errors.cc:83\r\n       3: ./rethinkdb() [0x82a6be] at 0x82a6be ()\r\n       4: apply_multi_key_item(receive_backfill_tokens_t const&, backfill_item_t&) at signal.hpp:41\r\n       5: coro_t::run() at coroutines.cc:214\r\nerror: Exiting.\r\nTrace/breakpoint trap (core dumped)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this was in release mode, so I don't have a better backtrace.\r\n\r\nInterestingly after this happened, I was unable to shut down the first server. It just stalled after pressing CTRL+C after printing `Server got SIGINT from pid 0, uid 0; shutting down...`. It didn't do any i/o nor did it use CPU. Could be completely unrelated of course.\r\n\r\nGit revision: c05d40aaf69478c29a497d30bc2919054942d016"
