      "@elifarley Ok sounds like you would be affected by #3757 then. The good news is that @AtnNn has implemented a fix for that problem and we're going to release new RethinkDB 1.16.2 binaries soon (likely some time next week). That should speed up `r.js` quite a bit, though it still won't be as fast as a native ReQL query."
