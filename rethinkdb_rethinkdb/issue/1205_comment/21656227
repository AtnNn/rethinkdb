      "You guys were correct! I had an older version of Rethink. However, another problem has now appeared.\r\n\r\nI now have rethinkdb version 1.7.3, driver version 1.7.0.2\r\n\r\nI received this error -- \r\n\r\nTypeError: Object #<ArrayBuffer> has no method 'slice'\r\n    at Socket.TcpConnection.rawSocket.once.handshake_callback (/Users/hackreactor/code/tuhinc/meteor_playground/leaderboard/packages/rethink-livedata/.npm/node_modules/rethinkdb/rethinkdb.js:14108:39)\r\n    at Socket.EventEmitter.emit (events.js:96:17)\r\n    at TCP.onread (net.js:397:14)\r\n=> Exited with code: 1\r\n\r\nWhich after googling realized may have been a result of my outdated version of node. I used nvm to uninstall my old version and am now running node v0.10.15, and yet am still getting this error.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help guys :)"
