      "I don't have the problem in 0.10.15 on Linux. I remember this issue cropping up in node version 0.6 (they apparently just forgot to implement ArrayBuffer.slice when first implementing the ArrayBuffer spec) but it should have been fixed as of 0.8.\r\n\r\n@tuhinc Can you confirm that these methods are defined for you just to rule out this as a problem?\r\n```bash\r\n$ node -e \"console.log((new ArrayBuffer).slice)\"\r\n[Function: slice]\r\n$ node -e \"console.log((new Buffer(0)).slice)\"\r\n[Function: slice]\r\n```"
