      "> `r.connect({host: 'localhost', port:20815}, function(err, conn) {if(err) throw err;});`\r\n\r\nYou're using the wrong port. It's 28015, not 20815 :)\r\n\r\n> I only get the slice error when I try to run my code from inside a js file inside my meteor directory\r\n\r\nI haven't used meteor much, but it's possible that it ships with its own, older version of node. That would explain the error. If that's true, I'm sure they'll upgrade eventually, but for now you'd have to update the version in the meteor directory. (I'd love to know if this is the problem)"
