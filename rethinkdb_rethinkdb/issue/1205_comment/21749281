      "@tuhinc Yes. I believe that node-protobuf requires node 0.10+ but if you're OK using the fallback protobuf code there should only be one other required change.\r\n\r\nNode pre-0.10 ArrayBuffer does not have the method `.slice` (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays/ArrayBuffer#slice()) which we require. If you implement this yourself (which we did prior to 0.10) the driver should work in 0.6.\r\n\r\nThere are some very extensive changes to the JS driver shipping with RethinkDB 1.8 (you can get that version by downloading RethinkDB from source and checking out branch \"next\") so you might want to try starting with that version."
