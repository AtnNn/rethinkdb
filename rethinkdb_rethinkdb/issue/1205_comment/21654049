      "@tuhinc The failure to install node-protobuf should not prevent you from using the driver successfully. In this case, the driver will fallback automatically to a slower, pure JS protobuf library. If you need better performance though, install the package libprotobuf-dev (or equivalent on non Ubuntu based distros) and reinstall the driver, node-protobuf should now install successfully.\r\n\r\nAs for the handshake timeout, my best guess is that you have mismatched server and driver version numbers. A new handshake protocol was introduced as of Rethinkdb 1.6 that is incompatible with previous versions. Would you remind reporting which server and driver versions you are running?"
