      "LOL oh god my brain after grinding on this for eight hours.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug you were completely right!!!! Meteor ships with an older version of node.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if you try to update it directly into the meteor directory, it breaks! Along with all my hopes and dreams :)\r\n\r\nI'm getting \r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\nnode.js:536\r\n    var cwd = process.cwd();\r\n                      ^\r\nError: ENOENT, no such file or directory\r\n    at Function.startup.resolveArgv0 (node.js:536:23)\r\n    at startup (node.js:54:13)\r\n    at node.js:627:3\r\n=> Exited with code: 11\r\n=> Meteor server restarted\r\n\r\n\r\nany ideas?"
