      "Unfortunately I can't help you there since this is outside of our purview, but you might want to ask on Meteor support channels. Those guys are very responsive, and they'll have to upgrade node eventually, so if you ask for help, they'll almost certainly help you out. I also can't imagine it would be too hard, there are probably a few small fixes that will get you going."
