      "@tuhinc if you can make meteor work node 0.10.0, I'm sure the meteor folks will seriously try to merge your work. But I'm not familiar enough with this library, so it may be a __lot__ of work.\r\n\r\nAnother way would be fork the rethinkdb driver to make it work with older versions of node. The driver used to work with node 0.6.x if I'm not mistaken, but we dropped support for some versions of node to use some nice features of node.\r\n@wmrowan should be able to tell you more about this."
