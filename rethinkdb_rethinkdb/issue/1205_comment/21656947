      "Ok, just tested with node 0.10.15 on OS X, same result as @neumino -- everything works.\r\n\r\n@tuhinc -- sorry for the silly question, but are you certain you're running on 0.10.15? (it's possible you forgot to switch from pre-0.10 version of node). Also, which query are you running that's causing this error?"
