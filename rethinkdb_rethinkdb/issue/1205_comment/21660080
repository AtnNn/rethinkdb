      "@coffeemug Unfortunately Meteor currently has no plans to upgrade to node 0.10.x. Meteor has a dependency on the npm http-proxy package, and until that package supports the new version of node, Meteor will be stuck in the past!\r\n\r\nI'm so sad. I was ecstatic about tinkering with rethink and plugging it into Meteor. I don't suppose there exists a hacky workaround to this? It probably wouldn't do much good to implement it with an older version of rethink."
