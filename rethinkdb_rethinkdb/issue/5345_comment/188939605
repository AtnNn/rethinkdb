      "You really should consider exposing a reactive-streams interface for client code. If you do this, the driver will be compatible with all sorts of java async libraries your users might be using, *including* RxJava (see for example: https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Reactive-Streams) but also many others like Akka, Quasar, Vert.X and others (see http://www.reactive-streams.org/announce-1.0.0). In addition, it has a nice TCK to verify your implementation against the spec (https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.0/tck/README.md).\r\n\r\n(Also note that page on the RxJava wiki has some good concrete recommendations for library authors)"
