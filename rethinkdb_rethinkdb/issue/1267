        "Right now, allegedly, `r.expr('abc').info()` would evaluate to `{\"type\": \"STRING\", \"value\": \"\\\"abc\\\"\"}`.  Anybody wanting info about a block probably doesn't want to deep copy the entire thing.  This has bad performance.\n\nAlso, the behavior of `.info` is completely undocumented.  It returns some nebulous object, why did we even add this function if we don't even document it, and just say it just gives the user a bunch of arbitrary, unspecified fields?  We should just get rid of it, we obviously don't care about having people actually use it.\n"
