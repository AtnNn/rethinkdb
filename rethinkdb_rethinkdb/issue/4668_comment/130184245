      "A second work-around to handle the case of an inactive server having a higher timestamp is now in `next` 678f8801f565f06d3e3a9947b052f6d465564705 and in `v2.1.x` df27878967e70a4c30ff040ef63c7deddf68f949. The code review for this was 3148.\r\n\r\nThis solution is temporary as well, but a cleaner solution is considerably more work and needs additional though. We will probably replace that code by a different logic in 2.2."
