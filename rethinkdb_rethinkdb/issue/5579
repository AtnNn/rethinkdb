        "Currently any non-option input you give to either `./test/run` or `./test/rql_test/test-runner` is interpreted as a regex. For most cases this is very helpful, for example:\n`./test/rql_test/test-runner polyglot`\n\nHowever, there are some difficult side-effects, for example:\n`./test/rql_test/test-runner polyglot/regression/522`\nmatches the regression tests for both #522 and #5222. And there is no way of running the former without also running the latter (without specifying a language).\n\nA better solution would be to not have entries be treated as regexes by default. We would still want to include all entries in a folder if that is what it refers to. There should also be a method to give regex (or at least glob) entries.\n"
