      "Fixed in a789e20e1dcacccf55e0d15a73b85c6bb5358771\r\nBranch: michel_192\r\nCode review 129\r\n\r\n----\r\nSo it looks like when using \"word-break: normal\", Chrome doesn't break when a span is closed/opened (that doesn't change the text), but when the span changes the color, it breaks. \r\n\r\nSo I fixed it using a word-break: break-all. The behavior for Firefox stay the same and for Chrome the cursor doesn't affect the line breaks anymore.\r\nI'll merge it once reviewed.\r\n\r\n"
