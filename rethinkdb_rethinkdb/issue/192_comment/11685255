      "Thanks! Here's the query in plain text (for copy/pasting):\r\n```\r\nr.a().find(function(value) { return value; }).react().hello(function(value) {return value;}).react(hello).(\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can reproduce it in chrome. Moving to backlog for the time being (the issue seems fairly innocuous because the query has no line breaks, and because we might be switching the way this operates at some point).\r\n"
