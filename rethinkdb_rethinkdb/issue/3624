        "Currently, the issue `server_ghost` has the following format:\n\n```\n   {\n      \"critical\": false,\n      \"description\": \"The server process with hostname `newton` and PID 10892 was deleted from the `rethinkdb.server_config` table, but the process is still running. Once a server has been deleted from `rethinkdb.server_config`, the data files for that RethinkDB instance cannot be used any more; you must start a new RethinkDB instance with an empty data directory.\",\n      \"id\": \"0a321521-0722-532f-92ad-973cf92b7cc3\",\n      \"info\": {\n         \"hostname\": \"newton\",\n         \"pid\": 10892,\n         \"server_id\": \"88a37e2e-ccf7-49b3-a84a-9c34f4eb0163\"\n      },\n      \"type\": \"server_ghost\"\n   },\n```\n\nPassing the `identifierFormat` argument to table doesn't affect whether the server name or id is returned in the info subdocument. This makes some sense because it's server_id, not \"server\" like other issues. But it should be consistent.\n"
