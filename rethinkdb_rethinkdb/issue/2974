However, if I use the index on the number field, the performance is dramatically better:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nr.table(\"work_orders\").orderby({\"index\" => r(\"number\").desc}).limit( 1).get_field(\"number\")\r\n```\r\nwhich takes _1.9ms_ for the same machine and data set. \r\n\r\nI guess this isn't really a bug, but the former syntax is much more concise and adding an index option seems natural. \r\n"
