      "Ah, you're right. I forgot we'd already overloaded \"non function argument\" for some API functions that take function arguments.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to solve the implicit variable problem so that you can write `table.map(r.row)` without issue. I'd prefer for the driver to not have to wrap the argument to `map` etc.\r\n\r\nSo what's supposed to happen when you type `r.filter(r.row['id'] > 2)`? It's obviously not the filter object sugar but it's not a function either. Is the driver or the server responsible for wrapping this in a function? Is the driver or the server responsible for implementing the filter object sugar?"
