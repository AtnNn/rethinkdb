      "So, I'm becoming less convinced of this.  I think that the C++ server should only bind the implicit variable for arguments of one variable.  It makes arity checking much more sensible, and isn't very hard to implement in the clients.  (You have to turn expressions containing the implicit variable into functions anyway; it should be easy to turn them into functions of one argument rather than no arguments.)\r\n\r\n@wmrowan -- what do you think about this?  How hard would it be to do in the clients?"
