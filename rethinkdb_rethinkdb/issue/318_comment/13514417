      "Whenever possible, I think we should go for dumb clients and overload sugary things on the server. It feels a bit odd to have the server deal with the `filter({a: 1})` sugar and isn't all that important now, but once we work out our low hanging bugs/missing features, the next thing we'll need to grow is more official drivers. If we implement this sugar on the server now, we'll thank ourselves many times over later. (The only exception I can think of is if this slows down the server development significantly, in which case we can acquire a bit of technical debt to get 1.4 out sooner).\r\n\r\n"
