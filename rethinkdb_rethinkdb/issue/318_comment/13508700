      "And another thing. The driver should be able to pass any term in place of a FUNC term and the server will treat it as a zero argument function that returns that term. We already do this on the clients, i.e. I can write the following and the driver automatically translates it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntable.map(1) => table.map(lambda: 1)\r\ntable.map(r.row['id']) => table.map(lambda: r.row['id'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI say this should be done by the server, not the driver. Yes, it's slightly easier to do on the driver but such a change will make writing drivers that much easier and remove yet one more gotcha for 3rd party driver writers."
