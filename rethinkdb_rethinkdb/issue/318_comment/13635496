      "This is not hard to do in the clients. The problem is that this breaks in a non-intuitive way when having done the obvious implementation in the driver, leaving any third party driver developer scratching his head for a long time. I can totally just fix it in the drivers for now and we can fix it later if it becomes a problem."
