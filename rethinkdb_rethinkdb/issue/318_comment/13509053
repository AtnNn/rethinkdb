      "The thing is we don't do this uniformly and in many cases we don't want to. For example:\r\n\r\n    table.filter(True) => table.filter(lambda x: True)\r\n    table.filter({foo : bar}) => table.filter(lambda x: x[foo] == bar)\r\n\r\nThe later is a really nice and useful piece of static value sugar and I think it's a more useful operation than passing a 0 argument function.
