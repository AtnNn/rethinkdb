      "This is mildly difficult to do in the C++ server because I'm handling 0-arity functions as if they never have to bind anything.  I could plausibly do some analysis on the body of the function to determine whether to coerce it to a 1-arity function, but I'd rather not do this pre-1.4 unless I have to."
