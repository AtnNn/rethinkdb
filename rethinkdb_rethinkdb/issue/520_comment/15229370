      "I just tested on my osx system -- I get 58ms, however I have an SSD (this seems quite high for an ssd). One theory I had is that @fourlincoln10 was running on an encrypted file system, but I talked to him and we confirmed it's not the case.\r\n\r\nI have access to an os x laptop with a harddrive, I'll retest on that soon.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime FYI, on Ubuntu and an SSD I get 23ms, Ubuntu and a rotational drive I get 160ms."
