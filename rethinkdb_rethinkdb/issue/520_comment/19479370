      "Haploid was kind enough to generate some logs of RethinkDB IO activity: http://pastebin.com/5zvxzPE2\r\n\r\nHe's saying that for only a single insert, he counted 46 FULLFSYNCs.\r\n\r\nI checked and it seems that on OS X, we do such a sync after every single write, rather than just once at the end of a cache flush.\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/arch/io/disk/pool.cc#L60\r\n\r\nThis could very very well be the reason for the bad performance. We should extent the file interface such that we can trigger the sync explicitly at the end of a flush, rather than having to do it implicitly after each write because the io layer has no understanding of when it should flush."
