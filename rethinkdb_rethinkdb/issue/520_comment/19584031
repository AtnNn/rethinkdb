      "For this, a quick fix will be to do a sync only before and after each metablock write.  This will improve performance more on large values than small values.\r\n\r\nLater, we could halve latency and reduce the number of total fsyncs by having the metablock contain checksums of freshly written blocks (if a sufficiently small number were written) that it refers to.  Those changes are for a different issue though."
