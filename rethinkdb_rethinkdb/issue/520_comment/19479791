      "@coffeemug: Yes, that was essentially what I meant. We just have to pass that information somehow to the io layer, and I think the best way is probably to just add a sync method that we call explicitly once the metablock has been written.\r\n\r\nBy the way: This could also improve performance on Linux slightly. I guess currently, we rely on the kernel to combine the writes in the i/o scheduler despite O_DSYNC being set. If we can tell the kernel when exactly we actually need the flush, things might be more efficient (which we should test though)."
