      "Hello @Ayrx \r\n\r\nThe Python driver used to be Pyhon 3 compatible, but this was eventually remove for different reasons (mostly because of protobuf). #1050 was tracking the first time we made the driver Python 3 compatible.\r\n\r\n@grandquista sent a pull request here for Python 3 - https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/2531\r\n@larkost merged the pull request in a branch, updated a few other things and now things are in code review so if everything goes smoothly, it should be available again.\r\nHere's the relevant issue to track progress: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2502\r\n\r\n\r\n@Ayrx -- I'm closing this issue as a duplicate of #2502. If you have more questions, feel free to ask them here (or on IRC - sorry I missed your message earlier today).\r\n"
