      "As per request, all the code is now on github. Changes to YCSB itself are in rethinkdb/YCSB (forked from the official repository). The limited java driver that our YCSB binding uses now lives at wmrowan/rethinkdb-java. All the other stuff needed to run rethinkdb vs. mongo comparisons (scripts, config files, the binaries) live at rethinkdb/rdb-benchmark. To get started just clone the rdb-benchmark repo and follow the quickstart instructions in that repo's README.\r\n\r\nWith that, I think everything covered in the original scope of this issue are covered so I'm going to close it. If you have any further issues with the YCSB binding, the Java driver, or the scripts, please open issues in the appropriate repositories."
