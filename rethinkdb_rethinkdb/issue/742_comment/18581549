      "@jdoliner No, there is currently no open code review with any code from this effort. There are two pieces I had to write to get this working. The first is a limited java driver for rethinkdb. Someday we might want to expand this to a full fledged java driver but for now I only implemented the limited set of functionality I needed to get YCSB working.\r\n\r\nThe other piece is the YCSB interface class that invokes the proto-java driver. This was mostly modeled after the other such examples provided for each of the other databases.\r\n\r\nI can open a code review for each of these components if you'd like."
