      "So great to have a standard benchmark running against RethinkDB.\r\n\r\nTwo small remarks:\r\n\r\n---- @wmrowan ----\r\n//\"To test mongo's default configuration rather than rethinkdb's, change the line mongodb.writeConcern=fsync_safe to normal, rethinkdb.hard_durability=true to false and rethinkdb.no_reply=false to true.\"//\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich version of MongoDB are you comparing to? Mongo has changed the default write concern to acknowledged in 2.4.3, so noreply should remain turned off.\r\nhttp://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/drivers-write-concern/\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that it doesn't make sense to compare both DBs in noreply modes. But Mongo's write concern should then be explicitly set to unacknowledged.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I think that the mode which is semantically equivalent to RethinkDBs hard_durability=true is journal_safe for MongoDB, but I'm not certain about how that actually differs from fsync_safe, and whether it is faster or slower."
