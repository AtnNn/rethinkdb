      "The script uses mongodb 1.8.3. That's the version that Mongo's YCSB binding is configured to run with and the one their YCSB readme instructs us to use. We could try updating to the latest version but if there have been breaking interface changes it might not work with the YCSB binding. We could also just create a configuration meant to emulate the latest mongo default configuration.\r\n\r\nAs for the distinction between journal safe and fsync safe, I found their documentation wanting on the topic but since our hard durability option does wait for the fsync to return before acknowledging the write it sounded like fsync_safe was likely to be the closer analog if there was a significant difference."
