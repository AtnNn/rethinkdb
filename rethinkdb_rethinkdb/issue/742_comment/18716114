      "I don't think we're ready to do that yet and may not be for a while. The main issue is the stillborn status of the java driver. Presently I've simply added a .jar to the repo with all the necessary classes but this is not sustainable in the long run. When we eventually have a more mature java driver that lives in a maven repository and we can make it a formal dependency of the rethinkdb YCSB binding.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to make sure that the binding itself is relatively stable before we ask them to merge it into YCSB. Until we've actually started using it and identifying the source of our bottlenecks we can't be sure we're not doing something incredibly stupid in the binding itself. Until we're sure that the performance numbers we get out of running YCSB actually reflect the performance of the rethinkdb server I'd rather hold off on submitting a patch so that we're not in danger of misrepresenting ourselves.\r\n\r\nIf you want to leave this issue open until those conditions are met and a patch is accepted then I think we should at least move this issue out of 1.6 since that process lives on a whole different time scale than the release cycle for rethinkdb."
