      "RethinkDB works now in YCSB! Everything needed to run YCSB benchmarks is installed on deadshot at /home/wmrowan/YCSB. There are some configuration and results reporting questions to be settled but all benchmarks run on rethinkdb and all relevant configuration parameters work correctly with RethinkDB. Most importantly we now have numbers that we can start working with."
