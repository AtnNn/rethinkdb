I am inserting it into a RethinkDB on the local machine on an SSD, and it takes over 100ms for the insert to return, even with hard_durability off.\n\n(I chatted with sakhm on the IRC channel and he asked me to file an issue for this. He suspects that protocol buffer serialization is the slow part)\n"
