        "As pointed out by @saurik here https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rethinkdb/sSB-rtXQPsk, the user experience of accessing nested objects isn't great. Consider the following cases:\r\n\r\n* Modifying a sub-sub attribute or a set of sub-sub attributes on different levels in a document\r\n* Modifying an element in an array\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while not discussed in the post, there is a question of querying based on sub-sub elements or groups of sub-sub-elements on different levels.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner proposed map on objects, a general purpose merge operation based on the object map, a set of sugar operations based on that, and ability to pass a custom merge function to update. All of these are great and necessary. We'll also need to think through potential defaults for update, array modification ops, querying complex objects, and possibly more sugar functions for dealing with complex hierarchies (such as `flatten`)."
