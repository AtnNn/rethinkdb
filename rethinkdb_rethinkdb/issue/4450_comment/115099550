      "> Is there any chance that this delete query is itself being run multiple times concurrently?\r\n\r\nI think that would be a problem with the promise being fulfilled before the query is done executing. I *was* able to replicate this with the official rethinkdb javascript driver, so if it is a problem with the driver it affects both.\r\n\r\n> unless there's a delete/update/replace going on at the same time\r\n\r\nI tried this and saw nothing except the correct deletes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"jobs\")\r\n  .filter(r.row('info')('query').match(\"(?s)^r\\.table\\\\(\\\"logs\\\"\\\\).*(delete|update|replace)\"))\r\n\t.changes()\r\n```"
