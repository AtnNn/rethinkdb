      "@cyounkins -- that's very strange behavior.  I don't think that should be able to happen unless there's a `delete`/`update`/`replace` going on at the same time that deletes some of the same rows.  Is there any chance that this `delete` query is itself being run multiple times concurrently?\r\n\r\nIf not, could you try running the skipping `delete` with `{returnChanges: 'always'}` and pasting the output here?"
