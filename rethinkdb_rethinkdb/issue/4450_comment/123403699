      "The primary index on the table is generated UUIDs, which I'm pretty sure cannot contain negative zeros.\r\n\r\nThere are two secondary indexes. The first is time, indexing a datetime element. The second is context.remoteAddress, which is a nested string element. I don't believe either of those could have negative zeros.\r\n\r\nI'll try to move the producers over to a new database/table and see if the issue persists."
