      "Ah, you're absolutely right! I meant this for the purpose of the existential operator. E.g. `default` will check for *both* errors and `null` by default, similarly to `has_fields` (or whatever name we pick). This suggests we might actually want to redefine comparisons to throw on `null`. I'll comment in #570."
