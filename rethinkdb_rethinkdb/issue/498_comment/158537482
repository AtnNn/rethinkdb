      "@coffeemug -- it doesn't seem obviously correct or obviously incorrect to me.  We've been trying to make `null` and non-existence more similar, but in this particular case it doesn't quite feel right (especially since we've considered making `null` a legal index value before, and are probably going to make it a legal secondary-index value to support the `orderBy` thing).\r\n\r\nMarking this as a ReQL_proposal and moving into `subsequent` so we can discuss it in-depth next ReQL discussion period."
