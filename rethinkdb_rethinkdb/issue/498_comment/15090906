      "That strikes me as a terrible idea, actually. It has the benefit of familiarity, but ternary logic complicates the hell out of things and spreads out and contaminates entire data models (and the DDL). See e.g. about half of CJ Date's writing on databases in the last 15 years. Using it as a placeholder is still kinda awkward, but it's an improvement over making it a fully-fledged user value."
