      "Ok, let's go with `:id => null` generating primary keys. I added regression tests for this (branch `slava_498`, internal review 363) which fail because the server currently throws an error.  Also, we're going to have to make the following changes:\r\n\r\n* `replace` will have to *not* fail when the user passes `:id => null` (it should behave as if the id was passed in and was correct)\r\n* `replace` will have to *not* fail when the user doesn't pass `:id` (it should behave as if the id was passed in and was correct)\r\n* `update` will have to *not* fail when the user passes `:id => null` (it should behave as if the id was not passed)\r\n\r\nI'm going to add regression tests for this as well shortly. EDIT: added regression tests for `update` and `replace`, and updated the code review.\r\n\r\nReassigning to @mlucy to change the server. I feel like this isn't part of sprint-2 scope and should be done together with other `null` changes, so I'm moving this out to 1.5."
