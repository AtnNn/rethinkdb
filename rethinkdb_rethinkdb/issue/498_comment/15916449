      "Should evidence of absence be treated the same as absence of evidence? Sorry, I'm not contributing, am I?\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is: I feel like you have two different interpretations of treating something as equivalent to non existence. Should null be an explicit statement that a value is absent and that it must stay that way (@jdoliner 's interpretation I think?), or should it be treated the same as a field which is simply not specified (@al3xandru 's interpretation I think?)?\r\nI by the way think that it makes sense to insert a primary key automatically if the primary key field is NULL. When I used MySQL, I often made use of this feature. It is indeed very convenient, as @al3xandru pointed out.\r\nIf you could insert a document with a null primary key I might think differently about this. But as that is not possible anyways, I don't think it is harmful to interpret a null id field as the intention of the user to have it filled in automatically by RethinkDB."
