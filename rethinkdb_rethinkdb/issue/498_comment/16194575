      "This makes sense to me for inserting, but the first and third points seem very strange to me.  I think that if you're using `update` to map the primary key to `NULL` you should almost certainly get an error, because you've almost certainly made a mistake in your code.  (This is because if you're in the situation Alex brought up and your framework is using `NULL` to represent non-existence, `update` wil clobber all of your other attributes in this case.)"
