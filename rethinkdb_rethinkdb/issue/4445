        "It's a small nitpick, but the error:\r\n\r\n    ./node_modules/rethinkdb/node_modules/bluebird/js/main/async.js:43\r\n            fn = function () { throw arg; };\r\n                                     ^\r\n    RqlDriverError: Cannot wrap undefined with r.expr().\r\n\r\nIs quite confusing if you don't know what to look for. As I was trying to debug, I was looking for something wrong with the query, the callback, or the connection, instead of the data being fed to it, based on the fact that it was complaining about an expression and showing me a function. This threw for me on a query along the lines of `r.table('things').insert(document).run(conn, myFun)` The fact that it was complaining about `r.expr()` was truly mystifying.\r\n\r\nI would change the text to make it clear that it's an issue with a data field. Perhaps `Cannot store undefined field.` might work better?\r\n"
