      "In the specific case where this came up, https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3912 would have avoided the issue as well. I think we should fix that one first.\r\n\r\nI think we should also always format dates, even if we don't do the remaining syntax highlighting.\r\nPutting into 2.1-polish for always formatting dates. Let's leave a more extensive solution (like on demand rendering of pages or sub-trees) for later."
