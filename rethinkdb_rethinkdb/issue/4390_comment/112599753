      "> Another option would be to just make formatting a toggle-able setting under the dataexplorer options.\r\n\r\nI think a problem with that is that if you turn it of, your browser is going to freeze when you accidentally run a query that returns a large result. We could have a \"force always on\" setting, but I'm not too fond of it. I'd prefer something that works without manual configuration.\r\n\r\nI think if we fix #3912 and still format dates even if syntax highlighting is otherwise disabled, that would be good enough."
