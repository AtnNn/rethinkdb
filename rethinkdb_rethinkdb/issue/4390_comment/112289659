      "Another option would be to just make formatting a toggle-able setting under the dataexplorer options. I think any decision as to when to enable formatting or not is going to end up being kind of arbitrary since the perceived rendering lag will depend a lot on the user's machine/browser.\r\n\r\nAlso, having a button to quickly collapse/expand all sub-trees in all results would go a long way in terms of readability of highly nested/large docs."
