      "Some drivers (at least the Ruby driver) rely on the names in ql2.proto to define the commands that are available in the API. We could add an exception for `values` to the code. Unless this turns out to be a big problem for a lot of protobuf compilers, I'd prefer not to change it in the main `ql2.proto` file though."
