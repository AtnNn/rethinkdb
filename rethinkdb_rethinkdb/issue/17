        "1. If I type a dot, I can then tab through the methods. But if I put a space after a method, then delete the space and hit tab, I can't tab through anymore. (it's a bit difficult to describe, talk to me and I'll show you what I mean if this doesn't make sense)\r\n\r\n2. Suppose I type the following: \"r.table('foo').eqJoun('id', r.table('bar'), ...\" After I type the second r., completion for eqJoin disappears, even after I put a coma after the second table reference. Again, subtle to describe in text, we can chat about it mon.\r\n\r\nShould be pretty easy to fix, but user experience here is very important."
