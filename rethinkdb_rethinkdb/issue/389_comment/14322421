      "Fixed in fabc948812d22bc79885833667abf47072c8ae3e, review 218, should be in release 1.4.  Done by catching boost::program_options exceptions that have a name field and printing out the usage for that name.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the situation where a user omits a required argument for a parameter does not result in a usage printout because boost does not allow us to find out the name of the parameter.  At best I could parse the exception string, but that would be ridiculously fragile."
