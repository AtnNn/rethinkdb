      "@jdoliner I'm not so sure about that. What if you run something like `...branch(table.insert(), table.sync()).run(durability=\"soft\")`? That could totally make sense.\r\n\r\nThe only thing is that durability does not have an impact on sync(). Does table.get().run(durability=\"soft\") fail?"
