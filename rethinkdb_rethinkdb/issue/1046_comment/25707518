      "Well the way I see it is that there just is no such thing as a \"soft durability sync\" or \"strong durability sync\". A sync is just a sync. That we internally implement it as a strong durability transaction is an implementation detail.Therefore I also don't see it as \"silently upgrading durability\".\160I don't think it should error. It also doesn't error if you run it on a table which has soft durability per default. Or would you have to specify hard durability explicitly in such cases whenever you use sync? That would be cumbersome. "
