      "I implemented the `sync()` operation with Joe because I need it for two other issues.\r\n\r\nThe current interface is that you can call `sync()` on a table, and it will block until all previously issued writes on the same connection have finished and are written to disk (including no-reply writes, unless of course they were invalid). There are no arguments, and it always succeeds.\r\n\r\nAre there any remaining objections and/or remarks about this proposal?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is in\r\nCode review #967 , branch daniel_sync_term"
