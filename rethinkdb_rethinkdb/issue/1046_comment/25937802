      "There has been discussion as to whether the term should be called `flush` instead of `sync`.\r\n\r\nI personally prefer 'sync' because that is a common term to Unix users. The Unix `sync` command has very similar semantics to our term (it writes caches to disk). On the other hand C++ for example uses 'flush' in the standard libraries, but in a different context (streams).\r\n\r\nAnother argument in favor of 'sync' is that it is already implemented. But since this concerns the API which should be as polished as possible, that is not a very strong argument IMO."
