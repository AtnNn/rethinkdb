      "Nah, I have a shadow commenter that comments on all the ReQL issues for me :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, presumably you mean noreply? If that's the case then I think the added complexity of a durability option to `sync` isn't worth it. It took me a sufficiently long back and forth to understand it and it has very dubious value. I'd just have a single version `sync()` that would do exactly what the users expect.\r\n\r\nAlso, http://www.defmacro.org/2013/04/03/issue-etiquette.html, EG8 and EG10 please (you're being kind of rude and I can't read your mind)."
