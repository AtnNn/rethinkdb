      "I agree with @jdoliner's original comment on this (i.e. I think `table.sync().run(durability=\"soft\")` should error). I think it's confusing to silently upgrade durability settings. I generally agree with @mlucy's comment above (there is no way around that in many cases), but I think `sync` is special case. We don't *upgrade* durability settings in other cases.\r\n\r\nI think a query like `...branch(table.insert(), table.sync()).run(durability=\"soft\")` is a very artificial use case, I'm really having a lot of trouble imagining people doing that in practice. If they do, I'd have this command run if the branch evaluates to true, and error if it evaluates to false. This will mean people can't effectively implement this type of behavior in one hop, but I think that's ok.\r\n\r\nI don't feel too strongly about this, though."
