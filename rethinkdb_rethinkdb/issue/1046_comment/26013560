      "@jdoliner -- a few things:\r\n\r\n* Things are in a bit of flux right now for obvious reasons, so for another week or two I can't meticulously follow every issue. Please give me some leeway.\r\n* Because of the flux + performance focus, we currently don't have a clear discussion period/window for ReQL issues that I know of.\r\n* The naming scheme objection was brought up before this change was merged, but the objection wasn't addressed.\r\n* Opening another issue is cool (thanks @mlucy), but it seems like process for the sake of process."
