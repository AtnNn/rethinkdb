      "@coffeemug for process sake I'd prefer if you opened a new issue on this. We had a discussion period for this settled on something implemented it and merged it. A proposed change should be a new issue so that it can have it's own links to code review. If this wasn't already merged that'd be one thing but other people like @atnnn use the issue tracker for release notes and I don't want to make his job any harder. It's easy to wind up with out of sync docs or forget to redeploy the docs if we don't do it this way. And I don't think it's a lot to ask that you follow these rules."
