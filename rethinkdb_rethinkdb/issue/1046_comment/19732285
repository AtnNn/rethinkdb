      "Hmm, this doesn't make sense to me. We have two durability options -- hard and soft, and the hard option is a strict superset of the soft option in terms of requirements. Since writes can either be done in hard or soft durability mode, doing a `sync(durability='soft')` doesn't add any guarantees at all (because I either did every write before it with `durability='soft'` in which case the sync isn't relevant, or I did writes with `durability='hard'` which is a strict superset so the `sync(durability='soft')` is irrelevant).\r\n\r\nThe only sync that actually makes sense then is `durability=hard`, in which case we should just call it `sync()`."
