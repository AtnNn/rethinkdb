      "I strongly prefer `flush`, mostly because it seems very clear what it does, lots of APIs already use it, and it won't confuse anyone. If I saw `flush`, I'd immediately know what it does. If I saw `sync`, I could take a guess, but I would probably look it up. Linux has an inconsistent naming scheme on this -- for example the process to kick out dirty blocks is called `pdflush`."
