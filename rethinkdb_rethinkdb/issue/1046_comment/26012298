      "Also @danielmewes as a general rule whenever you finish a bug could close the bug and provide the following information:\r\n\r\n- Review number\r\n- Commit\r\n- Which version you expect this to ship in so (1.11) for this issue.\r\n\r\nI know processes like this are annoying but getting them right helps others.\r\n\r\nAlso incredibly minor gripe: if you use #review_number then it will link to an issue which can be a kind of confusing link to click."
