        "In the Ruby driver you can write this:\n\n``` rb\nr.connect(...) {|conn|\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nTo open a connection and have it automatically be closed when you reach the end of the block.  I know Python has a similar idiom, and I assume JS does too, but looking at the docs it looks like only the Ruby driver supports this.  (We also support the same thing for cursors in Ruby.)\n\nI just answered a question on Stack Overflow from a guy who was leaking connections, and realized I couldn't actually suggest this as a way to always make sure connections are closed because it doesn't work in all the drivers.\n\n(Thoughts @Tryneus, @deontologician ?)\n"
