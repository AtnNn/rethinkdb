        "This was pretty surprising to me:\r\n```js\r\n> r.expr([1, 2, 3]).forEach(r.table('t1').insert({b: 'foo'}))\r\n\r\n{\r\n    \"deleted\": 0 ,\r\n    \"errors\": 0 ,\r\n    \"generated_keys\": [\r\n        \"41c50ebd-37c4-4f29-bb3a-90c9a7747761\" ,\r\n        \"41c50ebd-37c4-4f29-bb3a-90c9a7747761\" ,\r\n        \"41c50ebd-37c4-4f29-bb3a-90c9a7747761\"\r\n    ] ,\r\n    \"inserted\": 3 ,\r\n    \"replaced\": 0 ,\r\n    \"skipped\": 0 ,\r\n    \"unchanged\": 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee how it's saying `inserted: 3` but uses the same primary key thee times? It actually inserted the document once, and then passed the result of the insert into `forEach` which aggregated over the same result object three times.\r\n\r\nIt works if I use `r.row` in the insert or wrap it into a function.\r\n\r\nI think we should consider always treating the argument to `for_each` as a function. Since `for_each` is for operations with side effects, I think it's rather unexpected to have the argument evaluated only once."
