It actually inserted the document once, and then passed the result of the insert into `forEach` which aggregated over the same result object three times.\n\nIt works if I use `r.row` in the insert or wrap it into a function.\n\nI think we should consider always treating the argument to `for_each` as a function. Since `for_each` is for operations with side effects, I think it's rather unexpected to have the argument evaluated only once.\n"
