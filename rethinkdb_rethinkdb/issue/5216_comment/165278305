      "The problem appears to be that our `active_range_t` is missing the empty hash shards.\r\n`splice_stream_t` seems to assume that `active_range_t` always covers the full domain though.\r\n\r\n`splice_stream_t::discard()` even has an `r_sanity_fail()` that should trigger if this isn't the case. However in practice this often doesn't work, because the change that's outside the initial hash shards will be filtered out earlier in that function if it's past the `right_fencepost`.\r\n\r\nI'll make an attempt at fixing this. We'll need to wait for @mlucy to get a chance at reviewing the change before we can merge it though."
