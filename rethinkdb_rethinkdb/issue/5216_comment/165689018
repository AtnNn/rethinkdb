      "Yeah I noticed the same second issue during testing.\r\n\r\nI just got a version that's at least passing all the tests, but there are a few things going on that I don't fully understand yet. Specifically I'm sometimes getting weird active ranges that lie outside the shard boundaries, and I'm not quite sure why that's happening. I can clip the ranges, and that appears to work, but there are obviously some things going on that I don't understand which makes me fairly uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nI'll look into this more tomorrow and will see if I can figure out those things.\r\nI'd *really* like to ship this with 2.2.2, since include initial changefeeds seem pretty seriously broken right now. However I'm not happy with my patches yet.\r\n\r\n@mlucy You can find my patch in branch daniel_5216, in commit 8bb8936e75b250e56551758cbc0f56859fd0b883 if you'd like to take a look."
