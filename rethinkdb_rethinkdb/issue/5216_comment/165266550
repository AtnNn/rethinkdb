      "I can reproduce this even with a simple `tbl.changes()` in the `init_trivial_fuzz.rb` test.\r\n\r\nLuckily it looks like the issue disappears if there is at least one document in the table for each hash shard when initiating the query. It seems like if a hash shard is initially empty, we miss any changes that happen to that hash shard during the initial data stream.\r\n\r\nI'm going to investigate this a bit more until @mlucy can pick things up again."
