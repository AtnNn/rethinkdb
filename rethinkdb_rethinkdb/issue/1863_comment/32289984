      "@nviennot Thanks for the detailed proposal and examples.\r\n\r\nIn your code, if some queries fail or the script gets killed, it will leave stale transactions and `:current_xid` fields lying around.\r\n\r\nI don't believe that `r.eval` is required to acheive what you are doing. You could represent the transaction as a regular json object (such as `{ transfer: { from: ..., to: ..., amount: ...}}`) and have a function that generates the selectors and updates for that transaction."
