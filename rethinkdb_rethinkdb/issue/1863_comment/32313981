      "Something like this also opens up the possibility for rethinkdb gems (i.e. letting people write and share snippets of reql code in a systematic way). It's really neat, but unfortunately somewhat distant on the roadmap (considering https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?milestone=41&page=1&state=open and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?milestone=58&page=1&state=open). We'll see if we can debate this and sneak a solution in sooner, though."
