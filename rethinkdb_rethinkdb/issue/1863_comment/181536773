      "\"Shoot the node in the head\" is an approach for when a distributed system declares a node dead but can't confirm that it indeed died. In order to ensure the assumption holds, it will proactively \"shoot\" that node, guaranteeing it will never return.\r\n\r\nThis is often done via network fencing or other means.\r\n\r\nMy example case is only a problem because Server A can come back online. If, when Server B is brought up, we ensure that Server A does not come back up, then I think it might solve the problem."
