      "@danielmewes -- I'm not 100% sure, but I *think* `union` is smart enough to parallelize the `reduce` if some of its arguments are lazy streams.\r\n\r\n@frankleng -- what reduction are you trying to do?  Usually if your reduction is something `reduce` can do correctly, it's also correct to never call it in the one-element case."
