        "Hi,\n\nHaving fun with your great work and considering to use it for my next product. \n\nCurrently I'm working with Node.js so glad to see the javascript driver on NPM. \nIn most cases it works well as documented but I can't find out about error handling except `Connection.prototype.setErrorHandler()`, which seems not helpful enough for node's async environment because the global error handler knows nothing about the request context.\n\nDo you have any plan to support more error handlers such as plain node.js callback `function(error, data)` or Promise/A `query(...).run().success(successCallback).fail(failureCallback)` style?\n\nThanks in advance.\n"
