      "`all` and `any` are used in Python, too.  Yeah, `some` and `every` are only used in some obscure 80's language that nobody uses :-).\r\n\r\nThey should definitely short-circuit, that's expected behavior.\r\n\r\nActually, the defined behavior should be that the order of traversing the stream is undefined.  This should be the case for a lot of commands."
