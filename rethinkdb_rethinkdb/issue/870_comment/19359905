      "It seems really weird to have `all` `any` `some` and `every` all defined. AFAIK most languages either use the first 2 or the last 2. I don't know of any the define both and they seem to basically have the same meaning across languages. I'd really prefer not to add an additional 2 keywords to the language that are going to seem like synonyms with keywords we already have to some people. Could we find a way to add this functionality to `all` and `every` that we like?"
