      "Could you explain the available forms from the user's point of view? I'm getting lost in the protobuf type sigs.\r\n\r\nAlso, if possible could we keep the discussion confined to the reql proposals currently in 1.6? We saw before that discussing reql issues not slated for implementation results in misunderstandings when it's time to implement them (EDIT: and it requires following many more issues for anyone who wants to weigh in)."
