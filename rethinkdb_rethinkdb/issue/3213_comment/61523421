      "@barkerja Thanks for chiming in. See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2395 for a `ping` command. Adding such a command so that it works reliably requires a few more changes to how the server processes network requests.\r\n\r\nAs far as this issue is concerned, the `is_open()` command is going to be passive, that is it will just check the local status of the TCP connection but not communicate with the server."
