      "With the information above (thanks mlucy) it turns out I don't need it.\r\n\r\nI am in the early stages of some Koa middleware that closes connections at the end of a request.  I was also keep references to cursors and closing them.  Since I didn't have isOpen I simply closed them and discarded errors.  Now I will simply remove that and am withdrawing my request.\r\n\r\nThanks all.  The RethinkDB team is by far the best I've seen at working with issues.  (And yes, I found the Github Issues doc ;)"
