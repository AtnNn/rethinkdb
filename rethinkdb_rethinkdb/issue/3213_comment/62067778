      "@mkleehammer Just curious what your use case is. Is this for monitoring cursors?\r\nI would like to keep the discussion of an `isOpen()` for cursors separate from this one and make it a RQL_proposal for the release after 1.16, because the semantics might be a bit trickier. If you think this would be useful @mkleehammer I will open a separate issue."
