        "If I run an `update` and it fails, it will return an object indicating that something went wrong rather than throw an exception. We discussed this issue ad nauseum before deciding on the current behavior, and I'm not suggesting that we change it. But this behavior means that people have to remember to check the return code, and the documentation doesn't remind people to do that. In fact, the documentation implies that an exception will be thrown if something goes wrong in the update, which is false.\n"
