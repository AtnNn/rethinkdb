      "Thanks for the reports @hwestbrook and @KishCom.\r\n\r\n@hwestbrook From the `top` output, it looks like the server is a bit tight on RAM:\r\n```\r\nMiB Mem:   992.473 total,  927.391 used,   65.082 free,    0.484 buffers\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe it's going into swap?\r\n\r\nA cache size of 768 MB is probably too high for a 1 GB node. I'd try reducing it to something closer to ~200 MB and see if that helps."
