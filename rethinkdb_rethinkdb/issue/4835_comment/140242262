      "@hwestbrook Hmm, is the index migration done or is that still running?\r\n\r\nThere's relatively rarely a reason to reduce `io-threads`. The original reason we added that parameter was to limit the Linux `load` average for people who are on virtualized servers where the provider enforces a limit based on the load value. You can try reducing it to something like `8`, and it might reduce the load (simply because of how `load` is calculated), but I doubt it will have a positive impact on the actual performance."
