      "I am seeing a very similar problem -- similar db setup as reporter:\r\n\r\n* DB is only about 1GB in size\r\n* only running on this one digital ocean server, not sharded\r\n* RethinkDB is the only real application running on this server\r\n* RethinkDB has 768MB memory (out of 1024GB)\r\n* I have recently added a new index to my biggest table\r\n* The server is not under a lot of load, way less than 200 reads per second, 50 writes per second. Occasional large bursts, but previous versions handled this with ease.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally locks up completely and needs to be restarted. [Here's a small graph from my Zabbix reporter](https://kishcom.com/temp/rethink_cpuuse.jpg) showing normal operations with the large cpu use spike."
