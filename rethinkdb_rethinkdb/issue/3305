        "Many metadata structures that have changed in ReQL admin are instantiated explicitly for `cluster_version_t::v1_15_is_latest`.\n\na) We have to introduce a new `v1_16` and switch those over\nb) We should try to avoid explicitly using `v1_16_is_latest` in this many places, because that will make future version additions a pain. An easy fix is to add an `INSTANTIATE_SERIALIZABLE_SINCE_v1_16` macro similar to `INSTANTIATE_SERIALIZABLE_SINCE_v1_13`.\n"
