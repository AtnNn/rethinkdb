        "If you run `rethinkdb export` in `reql_admin`, it will export `r.db('rethinkdb')`, which I think is fine.  It's actually kind of cool to be able to make a backup of your cluster configuration.\n\nThe problem, however, is that running `rethinkdb import -d` will automatically try to import these tables.  I think the script should skip system tables when importing a directory.  A user could still import a system table explicitly using `rethinkdb import -f`. \n"
