        "The build system for the web-ui involves collecting a number of JavaScript packages, and their dependencies, through `npm` and then using `browserify` (itself collected though `npm`) to prepare them for inclusion. However, as seen in #5055 the current system is not quite connected in a seamless manner:\r\n- we are checking for system-installed versions of `browserify` in `configure` to see if we need to download it, but then we have peg the version (and all included submodules) in the `mk/support/pkg/browserify.shrinkwrap` file to (newly) `12.0.1`.\r\n- there is a version in `mk/support/pkg/browserify.sh`, but are doing little with that\r\n- additionally there is a disconnected version for `browsirify` in `admin/package.json` that then is frozen into `admin/npm-shrinkwrap.json`.\r\n\r\nThis is probably going to intersect with #4964 (Make sure that --allow-fetch works as advertised)."
