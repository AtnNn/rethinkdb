All I see is this: http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/cluster-on-startup/ while, it's acceptable, it's not as good as it should be.\r\n2. Is there a way to name a server on startup or in the config file? I have a script to fire up a server on two different machines and cluster. However, they both have a conflict because of they're named the same thing.\r\n"
