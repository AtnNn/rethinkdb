      "@ramanala Your understanding is correct.\r\n\r\nNote that unless it's caused by software bugs or RAM corruption before being written to disk (which checksums don't fully protect against either), corruption of data on disk is rarely silent because disk drives (and I assume SSDs too) use their own checksums and a read will fail if the drive can't get a consistent read.\r\n\r\nDocumenting this assumption is a good idea. I'll open an issue in our documentation repository ( https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues ). I think we can add it to our architecture FAQ at https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/architecture/#data-storage ."
