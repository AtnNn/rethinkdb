      "On a side note: The table listing doesn't appear to distinguish databases by UUID, but only by name:\r\n![db conflict tables](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/505365/8388603/dec344c6-1c18-11e5-884f-6771a420dbf0.png)\r\n\r\n(there actually is only one table `t1` in one of the `test` databases)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we could fix this too. (*Edit*: We should probably also change the \"Delete Database\" button to delete from `db_config` using a UUID then, because currently you cannot delete a database with a name conflict since `dbDrop` doesn't allow it)."
