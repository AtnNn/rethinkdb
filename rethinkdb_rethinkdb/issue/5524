        "Hey guys,\n\nI am hitting the following problem: Suppose that I have the following structure:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"data\": {\n       \"arr\": [{\"text\":\"item1\"}]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd the following query:\n\n``` javascript\nr.db('test').table('test').get(1).update(function (item) {\n    return {\n        data: {\n          arr: item('data')('arr').map(function (row) {\n             return r.branch(\n                  row('text').eq('item1'),\n                  row.merge({updated:true}),\n                  row\n             )\n          })\n        }\n    }\n})\n```\n\nI am listening for changes in this specific array only, and when the item is updated both create and delete events are emitted. I really need to receive an update event, e.g. `old_val` is not null and `new_val` is not null.\n\nThanks in advance guys\n"
