        "Currently in the raft branch, `table_status` may look like this in the middle of a primary hand off (in some very inconvenient circumstances):\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"shards\" : [\n    {\n      \"primary_replicas\": [\"foo\", \"bar\"],\n      \"replicas\": [\n        {\n          \"server\": \"foo\",\n          \"state\": \"backfilling\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"server\": \"bar\",\n          \"state\": \"backfilling\"\n         }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIdeally, it would be nice to be able to tell easily which replica is becoming the primary either through election or configuration. For configuration, technically we can get this from table_config, but that's kind of annoying. For election, apparently we can dig through `_debug_table_status`, but it's really buried\n\nWhat I'd like to have is the primary replicas array contain some objects that give more info on how a server became a primary for the current table:\n\n**primary_replicas array objects**\n- `server`: server id or name based on the usual optarg\n- `primary_because`: <\"was_configured\" | \"is_configured\" | \"elected\">\n- `progress`: [int, int] hash shards it is the primary for, vs. hash shards it should be the primary for\n\nExample:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"shards\" : [\n    {\n      \"primary_replicas\": [\n        {\n          \"server\": \"foo\",\n          \"primary_because\": \"elected\",\n          \"progress\": [4/8]\n         },\n         {\n           \"server\": \"bar\",\n           \"primary_because\": \"is_configured\",\n           \"progress\": [4/0],\n          },\n      ],\n      \"replicas\": [\n        {\n          \"server\": \"foo\",\n          \"state\": \"backfilling\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"server\": \"bar\",\n          \"state\": \"backfilling\"\n         }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nI'm imagining the possible combinations in the \"primary_because\" field would be:\n- `was_configured`, `is_configued` user changed configuration\n- `is_configured`, `elected` failover\n\nThis is pretty rough, and I realize that some of this is overlapping with the jobs table and table_config, but it'd be nice to have this info at a glance in table status\n"
