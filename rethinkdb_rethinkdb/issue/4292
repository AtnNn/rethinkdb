        "Currently in the raft branch, `table_status` may look like this in the middle of a primary hand off (in some very inconvenient circumstances):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"shards\" : [\r\n    {\r\n      \"primary_replicas\": [\"foo\", \"bar\"],\r\n      \"replicas\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"server\": \"foo\",\r\n          \"state\": \"backfilling\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"server\": \"bar\",\r\n          \"state\": \"backfilling\"\r\n         }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, it would be nice to be able to tell easily which replica is becoming the primary either through election or configuration. For configuration, technically we can get this from table_config, but that's kind of annoying. For election, apparently we can dig through `_debug_table_status`, but it's really buried\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to have is the primary replicas array contain some objects that give more info on how a server became a primary for the current table:\r\n\r\n**primary_replicas array objects**\r\n* `server`: server id or name based on the usual optarg\r\n* `primary_because`: <\"was_configured\" | \"is_configured\" | \"elected\">\r\n* `progress`: [int, int] hash shards it is the primary for, vs. hash shards it should be the primary for\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"shards\" : [\r\n    {\r\n      \"primary_replicas\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"server\": \"foo\",\r\n          \"primary_because\": \"elected\",\r\n          \"progress\": [4/8]\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n           \"server\": \"bar\",\r\n           \"primary_because\": \"is_configured\",\r\n           \"progress\": [4/0],\r\n          },\r\n      ],\r\n      \"replicas\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"server\": \"foo\",\r\n          \"state\": \"backfilling\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"server\": \"bar\",\r\n          \"state\": \"backfilling\"\r\n         }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm imagining the possible combinations in the \"primary_because\" field would be:\r\n\r\n* `was_configured`, `is_configued` user changed configuration\r\n* `is_configured`, `elected` failover\r\n\r\nThis is pretty rough, and I realize that some of this is overlapping with the jobs table and table_config, but it'd be nice to have this info at a glance in table status"
