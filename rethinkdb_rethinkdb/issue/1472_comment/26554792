      "I would prefer to not override browser behavior if possible. Here are some opinions other have expressed on the matter:\r\n\r\n-  A JavaScript solution at actually changes the margins to make the page appear like it's centered. I'm not sure how well this works in OS X Chrome / Safari, where scrollbars actually sit on top of the content and disappear if they're not used for a few seconds: http://www.aaubry.net/post/2010/12/28/Fixing-jumping-content-when-scrollbars-appear :\r\n\r\n- Quora thread, where people basically suggest overflow-y: scroll: http://www.quora.com/How-can-you-stop-a-centred-web-page-from-jumping-when-a-scroll-bar-appears-on-the-page\r\n\r\n- Another JavaScript solution: http://www.johnpezzetti.com/2011/01/31/removing-vertical-scrollbar-jump-shift-problem-a-javascript-fix-for-all-browsers\r\n\r\nMy inclination would be to avoid over-riding browser behavior, but I'd like for @neumino to play with these solutions so we can test them in a few browsers."
