      "**Installation on Debian 7, the my way** (a lot faster...)\r\n\r\n1. Create add-apt-repository script. Follow this: http://blog.anantshri.info/howto-add-ppa-in-debian/\r\n2. Install rethinkdb like in Ubuntu. Follow official docs: http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/\r\n\r\nThat's all (-;\r\nI installed it like this way, and works perfectly.\r\n\r\nNot sure what about protobuf. It's not installed as dependency, and installing it doesn't change anything.\r\n"
