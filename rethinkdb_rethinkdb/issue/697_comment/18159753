      "If it can help you @atnnn, here are some informations on different distributions\r\n\r\n- Mint 14 and Debian 7 can build RethinkDB without having to install testing packages (You still have to build node.js yourself on Debian 7).\r\n\r\n- I have issues to compile on Debian 6. Last time I tried (a month ago), taking all the protobuf packages from wheezy was working. I somehow couldn't do it again yesterday.\r\n\r\n- Fedora 18 doesn't compile for a strange reason -- something related to protobuf again, but not sure what exactly.\r\n\r\n- Archlinux has to downgrade its protobuf library and python\r\n\r\n- I haven't (yet) try CentOS, Gentoo and Ubuntu -- even if I don't expect a lot of trouble with Ubuntu since I did compile on Mint."
