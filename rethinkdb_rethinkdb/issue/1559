        "It takes up to 20% of the server's CPU time during inserts.\nWhat's worse though is that it is called in `data_block_manager_t::mark_garbage()` which in turn is called heavily in `log_serializer_t::index_write()` in a section where we cannot yield. This often hogs the thread for something like 100ms, driving latency up.\n\nWe either have to make `check_and_handle_empty_extent()` faster or modify `index_write()` to be able to yield (probably by adding some lock).\n\nRoughly half of the time in check_and_handle_empty_extent is spent on updating the priority queue (see the line `entry->our_pq_entry->update();` at the end of the function). The profiler could not assign the reamining half to any part in particular. My current suspect is `entry->all_garbage()` which ends up performing a loop each time it is called.\n"
