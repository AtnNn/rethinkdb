        "The `db_config_artificial_table_backend_t` calls back into the `real_reql_cluster_interface_t` to drop a database. `r.db(\"foo\").config().delete()` takes the cluster interfaces in a chain of command style, it skips through the artificial into the real, the real then makes a single selection from the artificial `db_config` backend which has a pointer to the real interface to drop the actual table in `db_config_artificial_table_backend_t::write_row`.\r\n\r\nWe should make a `db_meta_client` similar to the `table_meta_client`."
