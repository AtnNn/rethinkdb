      "I'm actually a bit dubious that the 1.5 changes will help this issue. As far as I know the backfilling code doesn't use datums anywhere and unless I'm mistaken those were the only things touched. I actually think that we'd probably need to improve our snapshotting system to be able to backfill a 7GB table table with only 1GB of ram."
