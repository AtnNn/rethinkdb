      "@mlucy that doesn't seem right. If the result of the map doesn't change, I'm not getting an update on the changefeed. So the map is indeed processed before generating the change event.\r\n\r\n(Edit: Oh I guess you just meant that to say that the map is applied to the old_val and new_val individually, and not the document that has those as its fields? I'm not sure if @coffeemug was actually suggesting changing that, but in any case I think the current behavior is what we want - minus the bug that maps don't work at all for artificial tables of course.)"
