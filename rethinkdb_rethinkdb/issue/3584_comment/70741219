      "Ah, yeah.  The deduplication and \"don't send trivial changes\" logic applies as normal (I think).  So \"identical\" was a bad way to put it.  I just meant that we apply the map to both `new_val` and `old_val`, so `r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs')('new_val').changes()` doesn't do what Slava seemed to be expecting."
