      "So, actually, the issue I ran into is this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs')('new_val').changes()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the feed returns all the values (i.e. `new_val` and `old_val`), but it isn't immediately clear what should happen here. Do we treat these fields as something that exists before the `.changes()` command is introduced? (that feels wrong to me, but is one possible option) If we don't treat them as existing before `.changes()`, what should we return to the user? An empty feed?\r\n\r\n/cc @mlucy "
