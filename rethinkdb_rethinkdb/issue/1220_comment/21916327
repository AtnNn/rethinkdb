      "It looks like this is because the `ql::env_t` from the original `query2_server_t::handle(...)` is not being deallocated.  As far as I can tell, this is because the `ql::env_t` is being stored in the stream cache, but still has the same interruptor.  I'm not sure this is actually a problem, since don't we want the cache to still be associated with its original connection?  Instead, maybe we should re-evaluate where we are constructing the interruptor in `protob_server_t`, as it looks like it's constructing one for every query, and it could just use the same interruptor every time..."
