      "I have a slight suspicion that this has to do with running out of memory and some allocation failing. I previously had crashes with std::bad_alloc() (`/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio` is set to 2 on this system). Maybe we aren't handling allocation failures correctly somewhere, and end up with memory corruption?"
