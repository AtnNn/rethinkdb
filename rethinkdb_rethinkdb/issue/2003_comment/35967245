      "Also I noticed that when a memory allocation fails, we sometimes don't seem to crash immediately (at least in debug mode). For example I got cases like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: Error in src/buffer_cache/alt/evicter.cc at line 63:\r\nerror: Assertion failed: [current_bag->has_page(page)] \r\nerror: Backtrace:\r\nVersion: rethinkdb foo (debug) (CLANG 3.2 (tags/RELEASE_32/final))\r\nerror: Error in src/errors.cc at line 116:\r\nerror: Uncaught exception of type \"std::bad_alloc\"\r\n         what(): std::bad_alloc\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it ran out of memory, but still had time to run into another assertion. Somehow an allocation failing had side-effects on a different thread, which kept running before the process was eventually terminated."
