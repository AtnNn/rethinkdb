      "We should look into this again for RethinkDB 2.4.\r\n\r\nOn Linux, we now use compilers that are recent enough to support this, assuming their support isn't somehow broken (I still don't have a lot of trust in this feature to be honest, given the scarce documentation on it).\r\n\r\nOn Mac I think we still can't use this, so we can't rely on it exclusively for handling stack overflows.\r\n\r\nI also have no idea if anything like this exists with Visual C++."
