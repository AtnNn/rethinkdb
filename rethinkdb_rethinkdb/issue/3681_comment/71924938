      "To elaborate a bit: There are two problems here\r\n- There's no backtrace. This might be easy to fix by replacing `rfail` by `rfail_src` and passing in the right backtrace in seq.cc?\r\n- We say `concat_map` even though that term was actually generated from `inner_join`. We've had other cases where this was a problem before. I wonder if we could use the backtrace to obtain the name of the original user-supplied term? Otherwise maybe we could add a special field to terms that maintains the term name from the original term during a rewrite, and use that to generate better error messages."
