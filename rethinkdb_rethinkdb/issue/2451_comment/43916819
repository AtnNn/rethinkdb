      "I'm not a big fan of `POST-FORM` and `POST-JSON` since they are not standard methods.\r\n\r\nHum, I found why I had some trouble sending data.\r\nI was trying to send a value that was an object and not just a string. Something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.http('<URL>', {\r\n  method: 'POST',\r\n  header: {\r\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json'  \r\n  },\r\n  data: {\r\n    foo: {bar: \"buzz\"}\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I didn't properly read the error message\r\n```\r\nRqlRuntimeError: Expected `data.foo` to be a NUMBER, STRING or NULL, but found OBJECT. in:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works as expected:\r\n```\r\nr.http('<URL>', {\r\n  method: 'POST',\r\n  header: {\r\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json'  \r\n  },\r\n  data: {\r\n    foo: \"bar\"\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess the current behavior is fine.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus -- I'm good with the current behavior, feel free to close it."
