      "How expensive would it be to try to parse all posts requests as JSON, unless the content-type has been manually set to something other than `application/json`, and if they successfully parse send it that way. I would also think that handing over simple objects (dict, array, etc...) should also trigger the JSON path by default.\r\n\r\nIt does make it a big magical (both in the good and bad ways), but would tend to be what the user wants. The biggest problem I see if that if the user intends to send JSON, but hands over something that is broken JSON it would silently (and unexpectedly) send form-encoded."
