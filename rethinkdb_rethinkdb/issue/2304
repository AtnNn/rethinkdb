        "On my mac, if I insert 120k documents into table A, and then foreach through the table and insert each document into table B, I get 60 inserts per second (on the dashboard). That seems really low to me -- in particular it would take half an hour to insert 120k documents. In #2303 a user pointed out that their connection times out, and I suspect this might be the reason.\r\n\r\nWhen I do the same thing with soft durability, the performance fluctuates between 2k inserts and 80 inserts. Which is much better, but still seems a bit odd.\r\n\r\n@bitterjug -- could you try the following:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntable(\"BigLottery\").forEach(function (bl) { return r.table('other').insert({ ... bl(...)... }, { durability: 'soft' }); })\r\n```\r\n\r\nPutting in subsequent as a performance issue."
