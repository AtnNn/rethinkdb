      "Thanks for the report @danielcompton .\r\n\r\nI wonder if this could be a server bug, since `table_create` should wait for a table to be ready before returning.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus or @encryptio, could one of you double-check please that the `_import.py` script is probably waiting for `table_create` to return before it attempts to perform any operations on the table? (please add a note here when you start looking into it, so we don't duplicate the work)"
