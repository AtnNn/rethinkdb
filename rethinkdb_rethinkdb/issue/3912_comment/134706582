      "\"Raw View\" doesn't currently display all results, so seems kind of separate from this issue.\r\n\r\nI think you're going to run into problems trying to exhaust a cursor on tables returning a large amount of rows -- Chrome hangs pretty bad at 12000 rows.\r\n\r\nI currently do this silly thing to get all the results for a query: `r.expr({all: r.table('foo').coerceTo('array')})` so I agree it would be nice for a more official way to do this, but not sure how much that is related to this issue. A download button as mentioned in #4760 makes the most sense to me."
