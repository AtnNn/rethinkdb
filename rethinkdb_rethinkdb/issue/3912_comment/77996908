      "I think this is because `orderBy` without an index is forced to load everything into memory, and it returns an array to indicate this.  If you do `r.table('analyticsPurchases').indexCreate('created'); r.table('analyticsPurchases').orderBy({index: 'created'})` then RethinkDB can efficiently do the ordering without loading everything off disk, which means it will return a stream, which should display only 40 documents like normal."
