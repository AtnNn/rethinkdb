        "@marshall007 noticed that you can currently create a secondary index function with `r.now` in it:\r\n```js\r\ntable.indexCreate('now', (row) => r.now())\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assume that the `r.now()` is turned into a constant at the time where the index is created?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me like this should be forbidden, as it's more confusing than useful.\r\n\r\nPinging @Tryneus and @mlucy ."
