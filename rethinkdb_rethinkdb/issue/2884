We could leave this interface intact and let the web UI keep using it.\r\n\r\n2. Take out the HTTP log interface and add a ReQL log interface. In this case, we'd have to pick an API for it and implement it.\r\n\r\n3. Take out the HTTP log interface and tell people to use third-party log management tools."
