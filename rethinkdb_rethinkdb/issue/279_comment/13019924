An error in the Ruby protobuf library we're using (which would be terrible)\r\n3. Network corruption \r\n\r\n@charl - do you get the same exception every time if you re-run the query that failed?  If so, it's probably one or two, and it would be tremendously helpful if you could provide the entire query.  If not, it's probably the third.\r\n\r\n"
