      "Ah, that's a very plausible mechanism actually.  Normally when we return \"failed to deserialize protobuf\" it's because google's protobuf deserialization library threw, so it seems very likely that this is a symptom of #283.\r\n\r\n(By the way, thanks for taking the time to  report this!  Cases where RethinkDB fails in the wild are immensely valuable for improving the product.)"
