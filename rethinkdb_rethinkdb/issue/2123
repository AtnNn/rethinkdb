        "On a system with, say, 32 GB of RAM, running a 32-bit process, maybe we'll look at the amount of memory available and set our total cache size to be 16 GB.  Meanwhile the process can only address under 4 GB.  We want the cache size to default to, I don't know, half the 32-bit process's addressable memory?  If this doesn't already happen (thanks to some artifact of the true behavior of whatever system call we use, perhaps), it should.\n"
