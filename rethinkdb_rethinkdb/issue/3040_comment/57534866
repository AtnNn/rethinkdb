      "I'm not talking about troubleshooting. I'm imagining a complete novice, who downloads RethinkDB for the first time and starts up two instances and tells them to connect to each other, and she isn't sure if it worked properly. I think the connection messages are very useful for reassuring that sort of novice user that their RethinkDB instances found each other. The way I see it, the way to decide if something should be `notice` or `info` is to ask, \"Is this message useful for a user running RethinkDB manually?\""
