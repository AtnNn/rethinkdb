      "I am ambivalent about the level on inter-cluster connection messages. I see their importance in some troubleshooting, and so would not object to them still being `notice`, but most of the time if I was doing that sort of troubleshooting I would want timestamps on things, so would head to the logs (syslog being my preferred, but we don't do that yet)."
