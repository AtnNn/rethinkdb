      "There are a lot of things that the user should see on the console that wouldn't be considered notices according to the [syslog criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Severity_levels). For example, it's important that we print the server's ports to the console (for the convenience of people who are running the server interactively) but that's clearly \"info\" rather than \"notice\" according to the syslog criteria.\r\n\r\nI wonder if instead of splitting \"info\" into \"info\" and \"notice\" we should split it into \"info (on console)\" and \"info (not on console)\". It seems like that's the important distinction."
