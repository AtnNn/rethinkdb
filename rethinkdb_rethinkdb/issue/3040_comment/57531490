      "@larkost: Are you sure that connection messages should remain `info`? The `info` vs. `notice` distinction is mostly useful for novice users who are running RethinkDB from the console and reading the output. The connection messages are helpful to reassure those users that their RethinkDB instances are connecting to each other correctly."
