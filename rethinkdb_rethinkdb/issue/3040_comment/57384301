      "@timmaxw I am not sure where wikipedia is coming up with the \"General Description\" column on their page, and does not describe how OS treat the \"info\" and \"notice\" levels. The actual RFC just has the information in the \"Description\" column, and the proposed usage maps nicely to that text: 'Notice: normal but significant condition'\r\n\r\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424\r\n\r\nSearch for `Emergency: system is unusable`\r\n\r\nAs an example, on MacOS \"notice\" messages go to the console (written into '/var/log/system.log'), but \"info\" level get dropped immediately upon being reported to asl unless they are explicitly saved by a non-standard rule (vs. debug which never make it out of the caller unless it is set specifically).\r\n\r\nApple's explanation can be found on this page:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/LoggingErrorsAndWarnings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000172i-SW8-SW3\r\n\r\nLook for `Alert (level 1)` to skip to the relevant chart.\r\n\r\nUsing \"info\" and \"notice\" both follows more closely to what systems do in practice, but also allows us to easily map into a real logger when that gets put into place. Trying to split \"info\" in two is just going to add complexity later without really getting us any benefit."
