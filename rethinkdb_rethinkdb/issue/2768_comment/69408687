      "> I think we should consider allowing `map` on single selections\r\n\r\nI feel ambivalent about allowing `map` on single selections. On the one hand, it would obviously be very nice. On the other hand, the users would start running into the fact that `t.get().map()` would result in something totally different from `doc.map()`, which I think would be confusing.\r\n\r\nAnother point of confusion would be introduced if/when we implement #2692. For example, if the user does `t.get().nth(0).map()` and `nth(0)` returns an array, `map` would act like `do`, not like `map`, which is super-confusing.\r\n\r\nI personally like your proposal in #3542 (adding an alias for `do` called `map_one`). It's easier to find, the name very clearly indicates what it actually does, and it sidesteps various confusion edge cases entirely. "
