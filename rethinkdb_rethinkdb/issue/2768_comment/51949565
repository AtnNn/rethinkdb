      "For the record, I disagree -- I think we should drop/deprecate `do` and make `object.map` behave as `object.do`, making `map` polymorphic. I realize other languages don't do this, but I think the use cases for ReQL are special enough to warrant this departure.\r\n\r\nI think the key/value iteration should be done via a different function."
