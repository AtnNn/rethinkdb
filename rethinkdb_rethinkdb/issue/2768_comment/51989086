      "> drop/deprecate `do` and make `object.map` behave as `object.do`\r\n\r\nIt would be a very bad idea to actually do this. `foo.do(f)` is already a valid operation when `foo` is an array.\r\n\r\nHowever `foo.map(f)` is currently an invalid operation if `foo` is a single selection. It might make sense to have it behave just like `foo.do(f)` in that case."
