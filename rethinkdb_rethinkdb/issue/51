        "I cannot find a reference to the \"allow outdated\" flag in the API documentation on rethinkdb.com/api .\r\nThe JavaScript driver has it in the r.table function, the Python driver actually has flags at different places (__init__, table, run).\r\n\r\nAlso, when I make a request with allow_outdated like this (in the Data Explorer):\r\n\r\n    r.table('stress', true).run()\r\n\r\nI'd expect that the request is served even if there are only secondaries available for the table.\r\nHowever, when I kill some of the primaries (there is still one replica for each shard online), I get\r\n\r\n    Runtime Error: cannot perform read: No master available\r\n    \tr.table('stress')\r\n    \t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nSo either the flag is ignored in the JavaScript driver, or the server doesn't handle this case properly?"
