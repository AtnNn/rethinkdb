        "[Addresses JavaScript Driver](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3158)\r\n\r\nThe following will use `tls.connect` when doing an SSL connection to a cluster. In order for this to be used, you'd need a proxy (Haproxy, nginx, etc) sitting in front of the RethinkDB cluster performing the SSL verification.\r\n\r\nFor now, the SSL support is only good for encrypting traffic and verifying the CA certification to prevent MITM attacks. \r\n\r\nFor the implementation, I'm using additional `r.connect` options: `ssl` and `sslCaCerts` so a connection would look like the following:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.connect({ host: 'localhost',\r\n            port: 28015,\r\n            db: 'marvel',\r\n            authKey: 'hunter2' },\r\n            ssl: true,\r\n            sslCaCerts: '/path/to/ca.crt'\r\n          function(err, conn) { ... })\r\n```"
