      "Alright, I implemented `info` and pushed to the branch `469_pkey_term` (the name sucks now but there's no real reason to branch again).\r\n\r\nI took this opportunity to turn `db` into an actual type managed by the environment, which had been long overdue.  This let us drop a nasty hack and generally made things cleaner.  (You can see all of this + the info interface in Review 447.)\r\n\r\n@wmrowan -- when you get a chance could you add this to the python and js drivers and update the regression test in branch `469_pkey_term`?\r\n\r\n@coffeemug  -- could you take a look at the review and make sure you like the interface?  (I made you a reviewer.)"
