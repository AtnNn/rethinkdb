      "@mlucy -- could you open all ReQL API changes for public discussion first?\r\n\r\nI don't know if I like this API. Here's what bothers me.\r\n\r\nSecondary indexes can be created via a reql expression, whereas primary ones cannot. We'll likely want to fix that in the future. We can already `get` rows via primary or secondary indexes, and it seems... impure... to me to designate a separate command for getting a primary key of the table. An alternative would be to include the pkey into the list of indexes and specify its type. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable.index_list() =>\r\n{ primary: 'id',\r\n  secondary: ['age', 'username'] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI prefer this API much more to a separate pkey command. Also, even if we introduced a new command, I wouldn't name it `pkey`. A very short name like that isn't consistent with our general naming scheme.\r\n\r\nEDIT: since we can unify the APIs, I'm adding to 1.5."
