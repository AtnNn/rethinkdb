      "I'm moving this to 1.10.  I don't understand why I can't just intall npm dependencies on my system and have building from a fresh repository work.  You could do that before.  It's impossible to make changes and reliably measure how they affect the duration of the build process the way things are now.  The build times have doubled recently for no apparent reason, and there's no way to accurately analyze where this happened because the history has this defienciency in all its commits.\r\n\r\nThis is just an objectively wrong way to do things that we'll pay for later, it's not how you manage versions of software.  It's impossible right now to have saved a VM image, check out a commit, and build exactly an old version of RethinkDB, replicating old conditions, and then make changes for debugging or fixing patches.  And if this node package manager changes at all, or gets culturally replaced by a different project, we're just screwed."
