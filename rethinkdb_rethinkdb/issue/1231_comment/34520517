      "I have improved the `atnnn/nofetch` branch.\r\n\r\nI loosened the version requirements for `less`, `coffee-script` and `browserify` to allow using whichever version is installed on the system. I was able to build the web assets with the newest versions of these packages, nothing seems to be broken.\r\n\r\n@neumino can you take a look? Here's the diff of the web-assets directory: https://gist.github.com/atnnn/8874462"
