      ">I would put the importance of this issue at super-low. If you're away from an internet connection, you're probably not in a productive environment anyway, sitting with some puny laptop somewhere.\r\n\r\nI would assume that if you're going to be using RethinkDB, you're most likely on a network of some kind, but I do agree that `make support` should be fixed."
