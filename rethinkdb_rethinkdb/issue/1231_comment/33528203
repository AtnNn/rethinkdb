      "The changes described above have been pushed to next (0f1eff4), with some other improvements that speed up parallel builds:\r\n\r\n- If the `-j` flag is passed to make, dependencies are now also built in parallel.\r\n\r\n- Building the include files for a dependency is now a separate step, which allows it to build in parallel with rethinkdb."
