      "I have written a small framework for fetching and building dependencies and changed all uses of `wget` or `npm install` in the makefiles to use it.\r\n\r\n* To avoid common npm errors, a custom npm config file is used that disables the npm cache and sets all options to their default values.\r\n* To allow repeatable builds, `npm shrinkwrap` and exact version numbers are used to fetch exact versions of all dependencies.\r\n* To allow offline builds, all transitive dependencies can be fetched once with `make fetch`. They are all copied to a single directory that can be archived elsewhere to prevent losing dependencies when `git clean` is used.\r\n* To simplify things, the same code path can also be used to build re2 and gtest.\r\n\r\nThe build will still fetch some npm dependencies by default because some npm dependencies have breaking changes in minor versions, and it is not possible to reliably detect which version is installed.\r\n\r\nAn early version of the changes are in the `atnnn/improved_fetch` branch, the rest is on my laptop."
