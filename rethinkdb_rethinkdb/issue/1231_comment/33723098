      "@srh :D\r\n\r\nCan you test the new `atnnn/nofetch` branch? It should not fetch anything by default.\r\n\r\nThe additional changes are minimal. Before putting it up for review I want to test it more thoroughly and also see if the upper bounds on some of the versions can be bumped.\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Error: lessc 1.6.1 is too recent. At most lessc 1.3.1 is required\r\n* Error: coffee 1.7.1 is too recent. At most coffee 1.6.2 is required\r\n* Error: browserify 3.24.8 is too recent. At most browserify 2.18.1 is required\r\n```\r\n\r\n@neumino @mglukhovsky can rethinkdb be safely built with the latest versions of less, coffee and browserify? We had a lot of trouble with breaking changes in less and coffee in the past."
