      "Why is gtest already in external?  You need to be able to copy external outside of the source repository so that you can restore it after a git clean -fxd, but putting existing stuff in it means that the gtest directory could get overwritten by an old version after it is changed.\r\n\r\nWhy can't we just build using stuff already installed on the system?  The build system used to be capable of this.  This is how most software generally gets built.\r\n"
