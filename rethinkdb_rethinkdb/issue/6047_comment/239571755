      "You could try sending us the output of `spindump`. Here is a line for the `bash` shell that should capture it:\r\n\r\n`./build/debug_clang/rethinkdb 1>/dev/null && sleep 0.5 & sudo spindump rethinkdb`\r\n\r\nNote that there are two things you need to do first to make sure this goes well:\r\n1. Run `sudo -v` shortly before running this command so that it takes you password then, rather than during the command.\r\n2. Run `killall rethinkdb` before and after the command to get rid of any other RethinkDB process (so it samples the one that just started).\r\n\r\nThen send the spindump to either `karl` (me) or `daniel` @rethinkdb.com and we can try to make sense of it.\r\n\r\nBut I don't think that this is a generic issue on Sierra."
