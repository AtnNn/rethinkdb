      "I have setup one of the computers in our office on MacOS Sierra and am not able to reproduce this issue on either the current `next` or  the `v2.3.4` tag compiling directly. It is possible that there is some problem induced by using `brew`[1], but that is more of a guess rather than a well-reasoned argument.\r\n\r\n[1] Side note: I am not a fan of `brew` generally, and in the case of RethinkDB you can use `./configure --fetch all` to get a better result without any more work (but probably a bit more compile time). I have no evidence that this is responsible, or even involved, in this case."
