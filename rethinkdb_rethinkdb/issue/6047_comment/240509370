      "The spindup confirms that you are having network translation issues (specifically in `getaddrinfo`), so RethinkDB is waiting for the OS to return information about network interfaces. Since that list is required for us to be able to then connect to them (so others can connect to us), there is not a lot we can do, other than maybe put a timer on that request and print a message if we don't get the information by some deadline.\r\n\r\nBut on a more general level, this is very unlikely to be an actual problem in our code, and more likely to be some bad interaction between MacOS Sierra and something else on your network (my money would be on something mDNS related, like an old AppleTV or AirPort router).\r\n\r\n@danielmewes: should we make this report an effort to report when it takes, say 5 or 10 seconds to do that?"
