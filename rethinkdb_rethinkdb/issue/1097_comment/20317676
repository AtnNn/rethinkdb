      "I don't think this is the intention. We were supposed to compile/generate the function once per query, and then call the relevant functions. This is definitely a bug. The crash might be happening because v8 can't handle that many functions.\r\n\r\nThe nice side effect of fixing this crash is that `r.js` performance will probably speed up significantly after fixing this."
