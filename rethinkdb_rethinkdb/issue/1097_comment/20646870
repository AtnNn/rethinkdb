      "For the record, there is indeed still a problem with ID generation, aside from what is in the other two issues.  I've been getting pulled in a lot of directions, but hoping to get to this one soon.  My current guess is that the javascript calls are getting routed to different extprocs, which would possibly explain the inconsistency.  Unfortunately the code here is almost impossible to read, so it could take some time."
