      "A few observations, though no solution yet:\r\n\r\n- This query will generate a js function for each row in the table\r\n- For each function generated, an ID is returned\r\n- The crash happens because we get a duplicate ID\r\n- It seems that this query cannot be interrupted\r\n- The query seems to slow down significantly as more js functions are generated\r\n\r\nSo, is this really the intended behavior?  All of these functions we're generating are identical, and I'm under the impression that the reason we have these IDs is so we can call the function multiple times.  Need to talk to @mlucy regarding how the ql layer handles this once he's available."
