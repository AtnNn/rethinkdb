      "I'm not sure if there's a better way of doing this.\r\nThe only alternative I can think of is using a multi index on only one value and then using a `filter` to post-filter the terms. This will be faster to write, but slower to lookup obviously.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that there's currently a limit of 256 values per document in multi indexes. In your case it sounds like you could reach that limit quickly if someone likes more than 16 foods.\r\nSee https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4222 for that one."
