      "Ok, so I ran this test after having fixed the crash in #1813, and noticed that the 'primary datacenter' request isn't outputting the correct error message.  I only get the following:\r\n```\r\nSorry, something went wrong with the ajax request. Please try again.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas, when I run the same test but with a name conflict, it shows:\r\n```\r\nSorry, something went wrong with the ajax request. Please try again. \r\nError 405: Multiple choices exists for this json value. Resolve the conflict issue in the web UI or the admin CLI.\r\n```"
