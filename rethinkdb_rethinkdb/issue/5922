        "Hi!\n\nI have a question about connecting to rethinkdb and I guess it's more of a linux administration question but I don't know where to start so I was hoping you could point me to the right direction... \n\nI have an app that connects to a rethinkdb instance on a different server. I am using an autossh tunnel to redirect traffic from localhost:28015 on the app server to the rethinkdb server. This is the command I have in an upstart script:\n\n```\nAUTOSSH_GATETIME=0\nautossh -M 0 -L 28015:localhost:28015 -N -o \"ServerAliveInterval 60\" -o \"ServerAliveCountMax 3\" -o \"StrictHostKeyChecking=no\"\n```\n\nThe problem is that often when the rethinkdb server is under a heavy load, I am getting \"operation timed out\" when trying to connect to localhost:28015 on the app server. But in the same time when I create a new ssh tunnel to the administration console, it works and I can query the server, so I think rethinkdb should be able to respond to connections through the ssh tunnel and not time out.\n\nCan any expert here give me some hints about the autossh config that could help me to overcome the \"operation timed out\" error?\n\nThanks a lot!!\n"
