        "I noticed in the commit log that @Tryneus just committed support for secondary indexes. I was planning on adding \"export to file\" capability to [Thinker](https://github.com/internalfx/thinker) as well. Now that the official export tool supports secondary indexes, I think it should be possible for the file formats to be compatible.\n\nIs there any kind of \"spec\" on the export files. At the very least they could save me the trouble of inventing a format.\n"
