      "I think I have this nailed: we are missing the `__init__.py` file from `rethinkdb/backports` because that is not defined as a module in our `setup.py`. Newer versions of Python (e.g.: Python 2.7.10 on OS X 10.11) don't care about this file, so long as there is an `__init__.py` in `rethinkdb/backports/ssl_match_hostname`.\r\n\r\nMy testing versions of Python 2.6 did not pick up on this because `backports.ssl_match_hostname` was installed by other modules I need for testing, hiding this error from me. This should be fixed in `next` with 346a6f64 and `v2.2.x` in 047184e4."
