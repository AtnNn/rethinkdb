        "Hi all,\n\nWe are in the process of writing a loopback connector for rethinkdb that uses the amazing `rethinkdbdash`\n\nThe code is available here : https://github.com/yoobic/loopback-connector-rethinkdbdash\n\nAfter running test (`npm test`) for about 15 to 20 times, rethinkdb will hang.\nI can see this message : 'Entering slow growth mode'\n\nThe only way to come back to normal is to execute:\n\n```\npkill -9 rethinkdb\n```\n\nI'm on mac, lots of RAM and disk space available.\nI can reproduce on different laptop.\nUsing latest of rethinkdb and rethinkdbdash\n"
