      "Thank you for the additional info @philips .\r\nSo it looks like the 100 MB limit was just a coincidence.\r\n\r\nI will set up a BTRFS partition to run more tests. Can you also tell me the exact Linux kernel version your servers are running on, in case the issue is specific to a certain version of BTRFS?"
