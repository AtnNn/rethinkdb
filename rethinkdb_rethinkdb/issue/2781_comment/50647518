      "Hi @philips,\r\n\r\nRethinkDB should only print that error if the operating system returns a \"ENOSPC\" (no space) error code in response to an i/o operation, though I'll double-check that there's no bug in that code.\r\n\r\nIt could be that we somehow submit a write before we have resized the file to fit the new data, or that we still submit a write to a high offset after the file has been shrunk to a smaller size. I yet have to check if that would actually cause this error.\r\n\r\nWhat's a bit suspicious is the fact that the offset in this specific operation 104857600 is exactly 100 MiB. @philips Do all machines crash with this exact offset?"
