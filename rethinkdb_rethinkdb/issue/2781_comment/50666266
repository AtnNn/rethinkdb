      "> It could be that we somehow submit a write before we have resized the file to fit the new data\r\n\r\nActually forcing this by commenting out the part of our code where we call `ftruncate` causes no failures whatsoever on ext4 and xfs. The file appears to grow automatically to accommodate the data.\r\n\r\n@philips which file system are your RethinkDB data files on?\r\nAre you using the `--no-direct-io` flag? If not, that flag might provide a work-around at a small performance cost until we find out what actually happens."
