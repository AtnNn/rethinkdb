        "I use the database in two different modes, one inserts data to it periodically or in a semi-streaming mode. The other is analysis of the data to find interesting nuggets of information in the data, this is done using rethink-miner and also the Data Explorer. Rethink-miner and the data explorer both allow arbitrary queries to be executed on the database and that may lead to an erroneous deletion of the table.\n\nIt would be nice if the connection could be marked as read-only and then the modification commands would not be accepted (i.e. insert, delete, update, etc.)\n"
