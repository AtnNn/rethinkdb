      "I like that approach, because it doesn't do anything unexpected.\r\nUsers have full control about what's going on, and we don't get into the problem of having super long running background tasks going on with possibly no way to interrupt them.\r\n\r\nOn small setups, clicking a button for each index one at a time is very easy.\r\nFor large setups running a script sounds acceptable too."
