      "Just to be sure I'm on the same page as everyone else.\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2797 to duplicate indexes is not making it in 1.14?\r\n\r\nindexStatus will return something that I can re-use to rebuild an index. If yes, then I can do two things:\r\n1. drop/recreate the index\r\n2. create a new index, run `indexWait`, then drop the old index, and use `indexRename`\r\n\r\n\r\n1. means that users will lose availability while the index is being rebuilt\r\n2. is kind of fragile. People can close the web interface and not have their index renamed."
