      "@gchpaco Oh if they are supposed to evaluate as equal according to the standard then that actually explains why `eq` says they are equal, but our serialization is different.\r\n\r\nWe should probably just standardize on one and convert any -0 to +0.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's release critical, and there's the problem that this affects the primary index so we have to think about how to fix this a little more."
