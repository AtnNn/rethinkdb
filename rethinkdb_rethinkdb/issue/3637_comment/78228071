      "Minor nitpick post-review:\r\nThis line https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/rdb_protocol/datum.cc#L617 doesn't do what it looks like it does.\r\n```\r\n // Sort negative zero as equivalent to 0\r\ndouble value = as_num();\r\nif (value == -0.0) {\r\n    value = abs(value);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince both +0.0 and -0.0 compare equal to -0.0, the `if` will trigger on both. It stil works, since `abs(+0.0)` is a no-op though.\r\nFeel free to leave it as it is, just thought it would be worth pointing out that testing for -0.0 isn't generally that easy."
