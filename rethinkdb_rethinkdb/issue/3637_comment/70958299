      "After talking to @gchpaco I've changed my mind in that I now think that it might be better to support both -0 and +0 as distinct values. I suggest that instead of making them the same, we change our implementation of datum equality to consider them as different.\r\n\r\nThis has the big advantage that we won't break any indexes.\r\n\r\nThere's also a concern that the difference between -0 and +0 might matter quite a bit for some geo operations, which suggests that making them the same in datums could lead to bad behavior.\r\n\r\nApart from changing our comparison function for datums, there's the separate question of how clients serialize and deserialize -0. I'm not sure how much we can do about that. I personally also think that it's enough of a corner case to ignore."
