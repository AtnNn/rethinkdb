      "Just talked about this with @Tryneus.\r\n\r\nI think we should do the following:\r\n- change the key serialization function to serialize -0 the same way it serializes +0\r\n- patch cJSON on the server to serialize `-0` as `-0.0` to make Ruby preserve -0\r\n- don't worry about other languages that don't preserve -0 (JS). There's not much we can do there.\r\n- provide a script that users can run that checks if they have any documents with -0 in their primary keys. I think so few users (if any) are going to be affected that this alone will be enough, but optionally we could offer them to re-insert those documents.\r\n\r\nI think we should try to get this into 2.0."
