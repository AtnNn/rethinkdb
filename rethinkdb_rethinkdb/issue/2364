        "When data is being read from a cursor:\n- In the Python driver, there are always 1 or 2 outstanding requests for more data\n- In the Javascript driver, there is always 0 or 1 outstanding requests for more data\n- In the ruby driver, there is always 0 outstanding requests for more data\n\nThe behaviour of the Python driver is desirable because it reduces latency. If data is being read from the cursor, there is always a request waiting for more data.\n\nThe behaviour of the Javascript driver tries to maintain one outstanding request, but avoids issues such as #2337.\n\nThe behaviour of the Ruby driver makes the code much simpler by avoiding concurrent requests.\n\nShould all three drivers have a consistent implementation of cursors?\n\nWhich one of the three behaviours is the server optimised for?\n\nWhich behaviour should be recommended to third-party driver developers?\n"
