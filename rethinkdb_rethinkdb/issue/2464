        "When I powered up my RethinkDB server, I noticed that its name was \"Vengeful.\" I hunted down the list of names (at https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/6edd4ce8d7e6786504162149f0f21a149b9722e7/src/clustering/administration/main/names.cc), and discovered that the vast majority of the names are violent, have occult connotations, or are otherwise sketchy. Particular examples:\r\n\r\n* Axe\r\n* Bloodseeker\r\n* Darkseer\r\n* Doombringer\r\n* Lich\r\n* Lifestealer\r\n* Necrolyte\r\n* Nightstalker\r\n* Shadowdemon\r\n* Spiritbreaker\r\n* Warlock\r\n* Witchdoctor\r\n\r\nWhile personally, I'm just slightly weirded out by these names, there are instances where the names could cause problems. For example, a person who has been the victim of stalking in the past would probably not want to connect to a server named \"Nightstalker.\" And a company I worked for until recently had to stop using a skull symbol in our logo while doing business in India, so I can't imagine the occult-related server names would be a good idea either.\r\n\r\nI'm willing to make a PR with a new list of random server names to use, but first I'd like to get agreement, or at least feedback, on a naming theme. Possible non-sketchy and non-trademark-infringing themes include:\r\n\r\n* Insects/arthropods (Honeybee, Beetle, Dragonfly...)\r\n* Fruits and vegetables (Tomato, Aubergine, Kiwi...)\r\n* Non-city airport names (Heathrow, Mineta, Mirabel...)\r\n* Flowers (Rose, Daffodil, Tulip... - suggested by @jdpage)\r\n* Dog breeds (Husky, Mastiff, Corgi... - suggested by @jdpage)\r\n* Celestial objects (Jupiter, Ganymede, Charon... - suggested by @jdpage)\r\n* Shakespeare characters (Frederick, Leonato, Dogberry... - suggested by @jdpage)"
