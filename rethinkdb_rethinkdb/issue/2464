        "When I powered up my RethinkDB server, I noticed that its name was \"Vengeful.\" I hunted down the list of names (at https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/6edd4ce8d7e6786504162149f0f21a149b9722e7/src/clustering/administration/main/names.cc), and discovered that the vast majority of the names are violent, have occult connotations, or are otherwise sketchy. Particular examples:\n- Axe\n- Bloodseeker\n- Darkseer\n- Doombringer\n- Lich\n- Lifestealer\n- Necrolyte\n- Nightstalker\n- Shadowdemon\n- Spiritbreaker\n- Warlock\n- Witchdoctor\n\nWhile personally, I'm just slightly weirded out by these names, there are instances where the names could cause problems. For example, a person who has been the victim of stalking in the past would probably not want to connect to a server named \"Nightstalker.\" And a company I worked for until recently had to stop using a skull symbol in our logo while doing business in India, so I can't imagine the occult-related server names would be a good idea either.\n\nI'm willing to make a PR with a new list of random server names to use, but first I'd like to get agreement, or at least feedback, on a naming theme. Possible non-sketchy and non-trademark-infringing themes include:\n- Insects/arthropods (Honeybee, Beetle, Dragonfly...)\n- Fruits and vegetables (Tomato, Aubergine, Kiwi...)\n- Non-city airport names (Heathrow, Mineta, Mirabel...)\n- Flowers (Rose, Daffodil, Tulip... - suggested by @jdpage)\n- Dog breeds (Husky, Mastiff, Corgi... - suggested by @jdpage)\n- Celestial objects (Jupiter, Ganymede, Charon... - suggested by @jdpage)\n- Shakespeare characters (Frederick, Leonato, Dogberry... - suggested by @jdpage)\n"
