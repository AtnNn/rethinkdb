      "@niieani, I think you want to be using `r.object` instead of your `retVal` dict.\r\n\r\nThat would make your query look more like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table('objects').merge(function(obj){\r\n  return r.object(obj('project_id'), r.table('projects').get(obj(\"project_id\"))('name'));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe behavior you're seeing is a side-effect of how we handle lambdas in queries.  If you're curious about the details, check out [this blog post](http://rethinkdb.com/blog/lambda-functions/) about how they are implemented."
