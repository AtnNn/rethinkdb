        "Ran into the following error running debug mode from commit e180692.  This was with the stress client, and the error seems to be a result of using multiple threads running update queries.\n\nexample error message:\n\n```\nRqlCompileError: Unrecognized variabled 182\n```\n\nAfter talking with @wmrowan, it appears that this was caused by a race-condition in `class Func` in `ast.py`, which increments a variable ID with access controlled by a lock.  The problem arises when many threads are constructing Func objects at the same time (i.e. using lambdas in rql queries).\n\nMerged a fix into next in commit bbfa557, review OTS by @wmrowan, cherry-picked into v1.9.x in commit 59855a6.\n\nOpening this issue to discuss if locking is actually necessary here, or if there is a thread-safe way to assign variable IDs without locking.\n"
