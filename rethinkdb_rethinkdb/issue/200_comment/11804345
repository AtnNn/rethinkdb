      "The first example could definitely benefit from a few typedefs :)\r\n\r\nFor the next few months we'll take an incremental approach to fixing these issues instead of a process-oriented approach (e.g. we'll try to clean up as we can, but won't put a rigorous process in place to make sure it doesn't happen again, or do an audit of old code). For now we're still in heavy development mode, and we don't want to burden ourselves with too many processes that will slow us down. (I do think max line width is a good one, it's just temporarily hard to do on top of everything else that's happening)."
