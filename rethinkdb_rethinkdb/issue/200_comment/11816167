      "The following is just my opinion that I've built through experience. Forgive me if I sound like a dick.\r\n\r\nI find it sad that writing readable code is a burden.\r\n\r\nI don't think you'll find a switch in people's brain to go from \"write unreadable code\" to \"write readable code\" when you decide that the \"heavy development mode\" is over.\r\n\r\nI think you'll pay the price later, if not right now, since this practice increases the number of bugs by decreasing the understandablility of the code. It's even possible that having low quality code slows you down much more than having a \"process\" in place.\r\n\r\nI'd say that it's even more dangerous when using C++ since any statments can have side effects that are really hard to guess by just looking at the code. I've looked at the disassembly of the generated release code of rethinkdb, some functions have so much garbage in them, it's astonishing. I invite you to take a look. Besides killing your instruction cache, it might have all sort of other consequences in terms of performance. I'm sure some of the issues would have be resolved by simply having proper code. It's like code reviews, they slow you down, but allow you to keep your velocity over time, because you build on top of a strong foundation.\r\n\r\nRefactoring a ~100,000 lines project is easier said than done, especially when not doing TDD.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I won't contribute to the code until this issue is resolved."
