        "See how [knex.js](http://knexjs.org/#Builder-then) does this same thing. Basically you can supply either a callback or `then`, which is chained. Promises help with clarity of code, and help avoid nesting code to crazy levels. Also, error handling is a breeze with promises. \n\nPreferably, callbacks should be replaced with promises.\n\nBlueBird, is a good lib for server side work.\n"
