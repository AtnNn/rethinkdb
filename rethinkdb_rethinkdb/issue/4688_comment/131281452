      "That's probably the explanation.  This is an unusual case because the `limit` is so large.  There's no absolute requirement that we do all the processing on one node in the `limit` case.  We do it right now because people usually use `limit` to get only a few values, so doing it in a distributed way would usually result in doing more work (because we'd have to throw some away), but we could plausibly change things so that we continue distributing the work in the case of a large `limit`."
