        "@ember-max brought this up in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2577#issuecomment-153793657\n\nCurrently if you close a cursor through `cursor.close()`, we don't call any callbacks to indicate that the cursor has been closed.\n\nAn argument in favor of the current behavior is that if the application calls `cursor.close()`, it could use its own mechanism to signal the component that consumes the cursor about it being closed, and it's not theoretically necessary to do anything on our end.\n\nHowever it can be very useful to give the component that registers the callbacks by calling `each` a way to get notified when the cursor has been aborted. E.g. something that visualizes a cursor's results in a browser application might want to display a visual indication that the result is incomplete, or that no more updates are going to be received (in case of a changefeed).\n\nThree options:\n1. call the `onFinishedCallback` of the `each` function in case of a call to `cursor.close`. Pro: Uses the existing interface. Con: Makes it impossible to distinguish between the cursor being complete and the cursor being aborted.\n2. call the `onFinishedCallback`, but with an additional parameter, e.g. a boolean `gotAborted`.\n3. add a new event type `aborted` to the EventEmitter interface http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/event_emitter-cursor/. Pro: Users who don't need this type of event don't have to bother with any additional complexity. Con: More difficult to discover\n\nMy favorite is option 3, and we could do it together with https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2577 to distinguish between the \"cursor exhausted\" and the \"aborted\" case.\n"
