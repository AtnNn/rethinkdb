      "Another thing we should do is probably split up the queries per panel. Right now everything is queried at once, so it updates as fast as the slowest query.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I think we should do the queries all at once the first time, and then after that have each query on a different offset so they are staggered like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nq1, q2, q3\r\nq1\r\n    q2\r\n        q3\r\nq1\r\n```"
