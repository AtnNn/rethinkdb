      "I'm not 100% sure about this, since no other terms that take a function default to the identity function if one isn't provided.  (Although, thinking about it, the convention would make sense for `filter` too; `seq.filter` would mean \"remove all instances of `false` and `nil` from the sequence\".)\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to introduce a `flatten` term."
