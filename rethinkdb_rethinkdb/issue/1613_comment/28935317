      "Given that we're in the 11th hour, I think we should disable the profiler in the data explorer by default and ship it as is, as an experimental feature. We can use the next month to iron out the bugs, add necessary information, make the output more helpful, and then turn it on by default.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone object to doing that and moving this issue out of 1.11 for now?"
