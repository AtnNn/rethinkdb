      "I don't strongly object, but I'm pretty sure I can fix all of the too-large profiles before the release.  If we're cool with not showing profiling data for e.g. eagerly-evaluated filter bodies (which seems really strange to me), I think we can ship this.\r\n\r\nIf you want a fail-safe to make sure the data explorer isn't overwhelmed even if I miss something, we could check during serialization and truncate any too-long profiles (I predict that @jdoliner will hate this idea)."
