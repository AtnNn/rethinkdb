      "@jdoliner -- you are of course welcome to take this back if you want to.  Let me know whether or not I should work on it.\r\n\r\nMost of what you need to change is in `datum_stream.cc`.  Stuff like `eager_datum_stream_t::{reduce,count,gmr}` and also stuff like `filter_datum_stream-t::next_batch` (for e.g. the limit case).  Also, I think you need to add something to `slice_datum_stream_t` for the `limit`, but I'm not 100% sure."
