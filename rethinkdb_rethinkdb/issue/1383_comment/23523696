      "Treating this like a table seems really weird to me. You can't do most of the things on a `wget` that you can do on a table. I think you'd basically need a printf equivalent to do what you're talking about. So it would look like:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nr.wget(printf(\"http://foo.bar/object/%s/json\", \"xyz\"))\r\n```"
