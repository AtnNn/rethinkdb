      "- Does someone has a use case with `depaginate`?\r\nFrom my undestanding, this is useful only for HTML pages (and not JSON).\r\nWhat do we expect our user to do with a raw HTML pages? Run a regex on it?\r\n\r\n- `depaginate` should be set to `false` by default. I probably don't want to hit my API limit because I forgot to set `depaginate` to `false`.\r\n\r\n- What happens if the server send back a 40x error? What does `r.web` returns?\r\n\r\n- What happens if the server redirect somewhere?\r\n\r\n- I'm not a big fan of `r.web`, it's kind of ambiguous. I would prefer `r.wget`, `r.curl` even if they don't follow the syntax of their respective command."
