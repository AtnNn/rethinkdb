      "Just a thought. If RethinkDB is executing these commands, then the servers that RethinkDB reside need to have the web ports open for them. I don't believe this is a typical scenario as the best practice seems to be to lock down the database servers to everything but the clients. \r\n\r\nI also personally feel like although this is a really nice feature to have to aggregate data, it almost seems like RethinkDB is now trying to be all things to all people. I don't mean that as an insult, I really love RethinkDB and it is very soon going to start replacing my other standard DBs. Having said that though, you can argue that if you don't want the feature, then you don't open the ports and all is well in production-land. \r\n\r\nAnother thought is that along these lines, you might want to have the ability to consume other data sources and make RethinkDB an data integration/aggregation system. If you go with a kind of pluggable data source model, you could write a SQL integration connector, a file integration connector, etc. and have formatters to transform the data from the data source into a format (e.g. json) which RethinkDB can work with. This is especially important for services which return XML rather than json."
