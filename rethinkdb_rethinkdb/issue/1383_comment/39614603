      "> First, @coffeemug, the second argument does not need to be specified, and is not an optarg. I realize I did not specify that in the latest proposal, but r.http may either take one or two parameters. I think this is better than having another optarg.\r\n\r\nVariadic functions don't play nice with optargs unless the variadic portion never contains an object.  For example, if I'm in JS and I write `r.http(\"addr\", {method: 'POST'})`, is the second argument considered the optional second argument to `http` or is it considered the optargs object?\r\n\r\nI'd rather just put this in the optargs; it will make the function signature simpler anyway."
