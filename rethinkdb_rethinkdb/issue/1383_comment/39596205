      "I agree that relying on the `Link` header is not universal (however, there is an RFC for it, and it's common amongst _good_ APIs: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#page-6).\r\n\r\n@atnnn is correct that there are many ways that APIs implement pagination. Having a sensible default that adheres to the RFC but allows you to override it (based on the peculiarities of the individual API) would be ideal."
