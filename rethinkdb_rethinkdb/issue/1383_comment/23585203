      "Also, this issue sparked an interesting phenomenon. Multiple people simultaneously argued that the feature isn't much of an improvement because you can already do this via `json.loads` *and* that it runs the risk of confusing people as to what RethinkDB is. This suggests that it would legitimately turn RethinkDB into something bigger than it already is, but it does it in a very, very interesting way.\r\n\r\nIt isn't a big change that targets a specific use case we don't currently handle (such as geoindexing, or pub/sub). It's a small change that opens up a whole bunch of possibilities across a large set of use cases. I think this means RethinkDB is *already* something other than what we've been thinking of it as, we just didn't recognize it yet. Considering that we are an incremental product, I think embracing this potential change would be much more fruitful than rejecting it. I'd go as far as rebranding RethinkDB to account for this feature (though that's far away for now as before we can do that we need to understand what it means ourselves)."
