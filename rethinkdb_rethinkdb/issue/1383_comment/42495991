      "> At least, it will make responses unpredictable and non-deteminated.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB supports non-deterministic functions in certain places, because it makes some data aggregations easier.  We also support e.g. `r.js` to run arbitrary JavaScript code.  We do check to make sure you don't put non-deterministic functions in e.g. atomic updates."
