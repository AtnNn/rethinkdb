      "> RethinkDB supports non-deterministic functions in certain places, because it makes some data aggregations easier. We also support e.g.  r.js  to run arbitrary JavaScript code. \r\n\r\nr.js is non-deterministic, but r.wget become even more ugly. You can't predict same url will return same answer during time and even during two serial requests. This you'll gave people bad instrument to make bad things. Things like url loading must lay at logic layer, not at database."
