      "I agree that `paginate` should _probably_ be off by default. I don't expect a GET request to automatically spawn more requests -- but it should be documented clearly, and not just in an API page (because holy hell, that's a cool feature).\r\n\r\nI agree with @neumino that `r.web` is not a good name. Perhaps `r.request`? I think that we should avoid `r.wget` or `r.curl`, because those are just names for UNIX utilities / libraries, while what's _really_ happening is that you can spawn a GET / POST request.\r\n\r\nIf we're only supporting HTTP, perhaps `r.http`?\r\n\r\nCould we look at libraries for other languages (Go, Ruby, etc.) to get inspiration for what this should be called?"
