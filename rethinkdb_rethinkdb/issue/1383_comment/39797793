      "I think the only outstanding points of disagreement are:\r\n* What pagination APIs to support, and whether to support an arbitrary function.\r\n  - I think we should support the one API that @mglukhovsky said is common to good APIs, and add more APIs or an arbitrary function if we have time before shipping.\r\n* Whether to complicate the initial implementation to support the twitter streaming API.\r\n  - I think don't do it.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any other points that they think aren't settled, or disagrees strongly on one of those points, say something today; otherwise I'm marking this as settled."
