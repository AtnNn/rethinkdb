      "We wouldn't necessarily have to do that with arrays (although that's how we do JSON import in the `rethinkdb-import` command, by the way).  I can see how it would be annoying to get some results and then a parse error before the end of the stream.  We could, however, parse subsequent JSON objects as separate items in the stream (ex. https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/processing)\r\n\r\nIf we did simplify it and leave that out, it would mean we couldn't support the twitter streaming API, which might not be a bad thing, seeing as it doesn't necessarily end."
