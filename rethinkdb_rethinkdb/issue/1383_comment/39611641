      "I like `r.http`.\r\n\r\nI'm OK with whatever people want the default option for `depaginate` to be.  (And it's `depaginate`, not `paginate`!  The JSON requests are already paginated, and we're depaginating them into a single stream!  Raar!)\r\n\r\nI agree with Slava about the second argument; I think `r.http` should take one argument (the URL) and everything else should be in the optargs.\r\n\r\nIf there's an RFC which specifies a common way of indicating pagination, I think we should just support that in the first version.  It would be easy to make `depaginate` take a function or to support more APIs later.  I feel like this interface is already really complicated, and there are a thousand other things we could do; I'd rather launch with a minimal set of useful features in a way that supports adding new ones, then add features as users request them and/or as we get the time."
