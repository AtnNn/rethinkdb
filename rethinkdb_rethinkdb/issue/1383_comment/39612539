Raar!)\r\n\r\nMaybe it should be called `paginated` -- by default it will assume the API is paginated, or you can specify how the API is paginated with a function?\r\n\r\nThis sounds awkward, I know, but a Google search returns just 2,200 results for \"depaginate\": it has the feel of an artificial / invented word (like when you take a noun or adjective and use it as a verb).\r\n"
