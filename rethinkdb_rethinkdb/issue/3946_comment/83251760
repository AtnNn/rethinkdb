      "I should note that if this is being put into 2.0, you should pay attention to the branch josh/3660 which is currently in review (and is slated for 2.1, not the 2.0 branch). It should hopefully be just css changes, but if any js changes are made it'll be important to take into account since #3660 is just a sweeping change"
