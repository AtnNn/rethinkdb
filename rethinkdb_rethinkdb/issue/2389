Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Click on 'history' to open the history view\r\n- While the history view is open, type some queries in the data explorer and run them\r\n- Click 'clear history'\r\n- Type another query and run it\r\n\r\nThe following happens:\r\n\r\n- Query doesn't show up in the history view. It should.\r\n- If I click on the history button, history gets hidden. If I click on it again, it doesn't reopen. It should.\r\n- If I refresh the page at this point, everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n/cc @neumino \r\n\r\n"
