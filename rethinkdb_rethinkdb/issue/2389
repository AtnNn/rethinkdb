Steps to reproduce:\n- Click on 'history' to open the history view\n- While the history view is open, type some queries in the data explorer and run them\n- Click 'clear history'\n- Type another query and run it\n\nThe following happens:\n- Query doesn't show up in the history view. It should.\n- If I click on the history button, history gets hidden. If I click on it again, it doesn't reopen. It should.\n- If I refresh the page at this point, everything works as expected.\n\n/cc @neumino \n"
