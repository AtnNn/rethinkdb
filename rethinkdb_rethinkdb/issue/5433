        "Can the change feeds implementation be enhanced to have something like named change feeds. Basically there would be a way to have something like `.publishTo('foo')` after calling `.changes()`.\r\n\r\nNow, this change feed can be subscribed as `r.subscribeTo('foo')`. This would be a top level call just like `r.http`.\r\n\r\nThere will be also be a `.changefeedList()` just like `.tableList()`.\r\n\r\nThe `.publishTo()` method will except an optional parameter like `spreadOut: true`, that would send out the messages to all connected clients in a round-robin fashion.\r\n\r\nThis can add the ability to use RethinkDB for so many more use cases (like a message queue).\r\n\r\nThis combined with abilities being discussed in #746 and #2520 would be really cool to have."
