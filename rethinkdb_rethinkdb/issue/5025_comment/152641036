      "@thinklinux -- these error messages are sort of confusing because the server doesn't know if you're using prefix or infix notation.  (The server can't distinguish between `array.changeAt(index, value)` and `r.changeAt(array, index, value)`, which some drivers allow or require.)  So when it says \"3 arguments\" it's counting `array` as one of the arguments.\r\n\r\nThere's an issue (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2463) to make the server return more structured error messages so that the drivers can produce an appropriate error message depending on whether the function was called prefix or infix, but it isn't currently scheduled.\r\n\r\nClosing this since it isn't a bug, but feel free to ask more questions here."
