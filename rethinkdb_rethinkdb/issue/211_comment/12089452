      "So there are a few questions here (that I can think of):\r\n\r\n1. What can we do about the map hack (we really need an `in`/`member` operator, but if we just do that, it won't help people access documents via a primary key -- e.g. how do I get docs with ids 1 or 2 or 3 by Pkey)\r\n2. Can we make json specific functions polymorphic to work on streams (e.g. what would it mean for `contains` to work on a stream? -- presumably a stream of booleans, but I guess this isn't very useful)\r\n3. Is there anything we can do to make nested filters (like above) more convenient?"
