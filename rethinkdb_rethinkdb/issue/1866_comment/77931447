      "I think we still need some more discussion on this.  The problem with turning `Date` etc. into time pseudotypes is that we lose the `r(x).run <=> x` constraint we currently have.  ReQL only has one time type, and it would be confusing to insert a `Date` but get back a `Time`.  We could fix that by having an additional user-settable field for the time pseudotype that lets drivers indicate what type it originally was, or we could decide that we're just OK with that behavior, or we could decide to just keep only supporting `Time`, but I don't think it's obvious what we should do here."
