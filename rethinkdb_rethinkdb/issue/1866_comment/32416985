      "For user-defined hooks there is #1016. It's been low on the priority list, but we will get to it eventually.\r\n\r\n> What happens if an attacker provides a hash with `$reql_type$`\r\n\r\nIf you're storing json you got from other systems and it contains `$reql_type$` the data will be inserted as that type or rejected if something is wrong. This is by design -- it's basically a json extension. An attacker couldn't do anything they couldn't do with providing a malicious json document without `$reql_type$`, unless of course there is a bug in the implementation (but json libs aren't immune from that either)."
