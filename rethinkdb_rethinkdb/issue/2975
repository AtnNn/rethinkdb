If the user passes `'error'` the commands should behave as they do now. If the user passes `'ignore'`, the commands should return a document as they do now with the value of the created field set to zero.\r\n\r\nThere is a question of what the default should be. We could leave it as is (by setting it to `'error'`), or set it to `'ignore'`. I think `'ignore'` is more helpful, and I'm leaning towards that."
