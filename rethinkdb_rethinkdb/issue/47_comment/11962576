      "So the low-level support in disk.cc seems to be present after all, just not commented. The argument is_really_direct to linux_file_t::linux_file_t (which is not Linux-specific anymore) controls whether one requests O_DIRECT or F_NOCACHE. All that we need to do is to implement a choice between the typedefs direct_file_t and nondirect_file_t in log_serializer.cc. We could pass the information to that point (from command_line stuff) via extra function arguments (either a session object or a simple flag for this option) or via a global variable. What would be preferable here?\r\n"
