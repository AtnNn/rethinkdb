      "I haven't looked at this stuff in a while, but here are two problems that I can think of off the top of my head:\r\n\r\n* F_NOCACHE may or may not be supported on all platforms\r\n* O_DIRECT implies that when one writes a block, the function does not return until the disk driver responds that the block has been committed to disk. This isn't the case without O_DIRECT, and may or may not be the case with F_NOCACHE. We need this behavior for sane operation, so we'll have to make sure it's replicated when O_DIRECT is off (one way to do that is to throw in fsyncs)"
