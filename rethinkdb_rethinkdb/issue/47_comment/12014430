      "@coffeemug - I'm going to do `F_FULLFSYNC` in the I/O layer after every write call.  This allegedly replicates `O_DSYNC` behavior (except that it presumably also syncs file metadata).  Also, there's no reason it would perform worse (except for the relatively negligible cost of an extra syscall on a thread in the i/o pool) than some specific fsync calls made in the serializer."
