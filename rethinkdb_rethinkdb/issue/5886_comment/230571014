      "Sounds reasonable.\r\n\r\nI don't think our geospatial indexes allow optimizing this operation. I think it would need an entirely different type of geospatial index, though there might be some neat trick to make it work with the current indexes that I'm not aware of.\r\n\r\nBut we could at least make the `getIncluded` term an internal rewrite into the `getIntersecting.filter` one to simplify its use."
