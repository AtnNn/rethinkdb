      "Got it -- thanks for the response!\r\n\r\nWould you mind trying the same test in RethinkDB 1.12.1 (released a few days ago)? There have been a number of performance fixes there, and I'm curious to see the difference in performance between 1.12.1 and 1.11.3.\r\n\r\nI'll also try to reproduce and benchmark locally and report back with the results."
