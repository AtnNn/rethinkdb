      "Yeah writing to the `db_config` or `table_config` system tables in the `rethinkdb` database is currently the way for doing this. It might not be the worst idea to add `rename` commands for databases and tables to ReQL. We already have an `indexRename` command for example.\r\n\r\nI'm going to re-open this as a proposal for some future version.\r\nWe have some other proposals that suggest changing the `*Create`, `*Drop` interface for tables, which might or might not affect this. If we end up deciding on https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3130 for example, the syntax for renaming should probably become `r.table(...).rename(new_name)`. We should hold off from discussing this for now I think."
