      "Even if all file_account_t's are passed to linux_file_t::destroy_account before the file is destroyed, a linux_disk_manager_t will construct `on_thread_t th(home_thread())` to go to the disk manager's home thread before deleting the `accounting_diskmgr_t::account_t *` object.  So you have no strong guarantee that the accounting_diskmgr_t won't be destructed before then, while there's still a set_size operation going through the system."
