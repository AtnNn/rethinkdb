      "Happened again on electro this time, so it's not just a fluke.  Running a different test with the same workload:\r\n\r\n```\r\n../test/scenarios/change_primary.py --workload-before '../test/memcached_workloads/multi_serial_mix.py $HOST:$PORT --save values' --workload-after '../test/memcached_workloads/multi_serial_mix.py $HOST:$PORT --load values'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth servers in the cluster crashed with the same stack trace as before, so this should be consistently reproducible with the right order of operations.  Since this is happening frequently enough and we haven't seen this before now, I would suspect that recent changes have caused it."
