      "I think `progress` might not work like this since primaries can also be different for subranges of the same configures shard, not just for different hash shards.\r\n\r\nApart from `progress` I like this. I think it's ok to have a little bit of overlap with `table_config`, especially since the information is presented in a different way here that is not just a plain duplication of information from `table_config`."
