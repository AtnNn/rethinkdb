        "There is currently no way of calling `noreply_wait` from with the yaml ReQL tests. This is because there is no way of calling anything off of the connection object. This should be added to the three language drivers. The other part of this is that since the ruby name for this does not fit the pattern that is going to have to be special-cased in `test_runner` to translate that.\n\nSo far this would only have an impact on `polyglot/regression/715.yaml` where there should be a `noreply_wait` in place of the `wait(1)`.\n"
