      "Hi @nuin , your log file lists the last restart for 2015-02-03 09:22. Was that the one after which your data had disappeared?\r\nDid the data disappear after you had restarted the server or while the server was still running? If you restarted the server: Did you restart through the init script (e.g. `/etc/init.d/rethinkdb restart`) or did you start RethinkDB manually on the command line (i.e. with the `rethinkdb` command)?\r\n\r\nWhen the data wasn't there, did the tables still exist and were simply empty? Or were the tables gone as well?\r\nDid you check whether secondary indexes still existed by any chance?\r\n\r\nWith the old data directory being lost, it's going to be pretty difficult to figure out how this happened exactly. We're going to think through any possibilities though."
