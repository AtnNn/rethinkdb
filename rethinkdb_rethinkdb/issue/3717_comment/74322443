      "@nuin We just released RethinkDB 1.16.1, which now writes a log entry every time it deletes a file (as per #1780). I recommend updating, so that we get some additional data for the case this happens to you again.\r\nSorry we can't do more at the moment, but it's difficult to debug without having the data files."
