      "Hi @danielmewes \r\n\r\nThe chronology of the events:\r\n\r\n- DB was restarted on Jan 27th. I moved my RethinkDB server to another room\r\n- Access was normal until yesterday\r\n- Around 9 am today I received a SysAid with an error on output of one of the apps that access the DB\r\n- Restarted the server after that and then did the update\r\n\r\nWhen I checked this morning, all databases and tables were there, but all of them reported 0 documents, I tried the data explorer on the web server and nothing was returned from past history command.\r\n\r\nNo secondary indexes were available at the time I checked. On one of the tables, I had created a secondary index.\r\n\r\nSorry, that I overwrote the old data directory. But as this is our only DB server, I couldn't just point the queries to another box. I am lobbying for new hardware, so we have some redundancy. I will keep daily dumps, and in my case I can recreate the data from scripts, the only problem is that it takes some hours from scratch data.\r\n\r\nI reported the error just in case someone runs into a similar situation, as it might help them and you to figure out. I use RethinkDB in my production apps, albeit all my programs run on a intranet, and I am quite happy with the performance and user-friendly features. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
