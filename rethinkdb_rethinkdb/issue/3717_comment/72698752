      "Hi @mglukhovsky, our server is small and it has 4Gb of memory, only a couple of tables are mainly active, with maybe 10-20 queries day.\r\n\r\nThe output of ls won't help you at the moment. I had to update to the newer version in order to be able to load data from a backup as we still don't have a backup hardware system. But I remember listing the contents of the directory and seeing the same files as I had before the data disappearance, but all files had a smaller size than before.\r\n\r\nI updated to version rethinkdb 1.16.0+1~0wheezy, including the Python module. Data load was fine and quick, but there's an issue on the Dashboard, as all tables appear empty. Checking on the data explorer, data seems fine."
