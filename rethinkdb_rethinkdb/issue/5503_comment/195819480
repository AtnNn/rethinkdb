      "Actually, looking at that trace a bit more, Timeout.timeout is a bad idea, it spawns a new thread for a start. Probably a better option is to use the tcp_timeout https://github.com/lann/tcp-timeout-ruby , either that, or write our own non-blocking socket code that we can customize the timeout. \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/21014272/how-ruby-tcpsocket-timeout-is-defined\r\nhttps://spin.atomicobject.com/2013/09/30/socket-connection-timeout-ruby\r\nhttp://www.mikeperham.com/2009/03/15/socket-timeouts-in-ruby"
