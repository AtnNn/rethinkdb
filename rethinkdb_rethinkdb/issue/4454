Also, the uptime doesn't update until the page is refreshed.\r\n\r\nIt would be nicer if the cache size was reported as *~25 GiB* instead of *25374.076171875 MB*.\r\n\r\nIn firefox, when hovering over each entry, the cursor changes into a question mark, but:\r\n * for the hostname and the cache size, the text that appears is \"null\"\r\n * for the uptime, something that looks like the launch time appears, but it isn't styled.\r\n * for tags, the styled infobox appears, but it isn't aligned the same as the version infobox.\r\n * for the version, here is both \"null\" and an infobox with a confusing error message appears\r\n\r\n![server2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/706854/8361053/4c0ec49c-1b60-11e5-9a4b-36f27d6be523.png)\r\n"
