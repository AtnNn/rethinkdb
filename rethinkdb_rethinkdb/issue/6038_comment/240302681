      "@ntquyen We're investigating this right now, together with the data corruption issue that you encountered.\r\nWe can reproduce the issue, and probably have a fix for it (but there are still some open details). We'll be delaying RethinkDB 2.3.5 until the fix for this gets in, and then release the update.\r\n\r\nSorry you had to run into this.\r\n\r\nYour point on impact in case a table goes down is valid. Performance-wise, I wouldn't expect much difference though between splitting the data up and having it all in one table. Indexes are tree structures, and operations on them have logarithmic costs in the number of documents. In practice that means that indexes remain very efficient even as the data grows, and there isn't a big performance difference between a small and a large index."
