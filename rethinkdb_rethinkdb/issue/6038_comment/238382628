      "@ntquyen Were all instances fully connected while it was looping, or is it possible that one of the instances was not reconnecting properly (or was down)?\r\n\r\nIf there is no connected majority for the table, it is normal that the nodes try to perform elections over and over again which will fail each time.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to determine which servers were connected from the logs. Could you email me the RethinkDB logs from all servers to daniel@rethinkdb.com ?"
