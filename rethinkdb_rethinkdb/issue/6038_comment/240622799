      "@danielmewes Thanks for your response, I'll keep waiting for your investigation!\r\n\r\nI have some more specific question on how raft is implement in rethinkdb. In which case exactly the raft election of a table got timeout? \r\n\r\nIn raft explaination, election timeout is the time a follower waits before become an candidate. This wait starts right after a heartbeat timeout occurs. And also when 2 instances receive the same votes at the same time at the same term, the leader cannot be determined, the wait happens then for next term. The latter could cause the timeout loops, but this case could only happen when the number of replicas is even, right? If what I understand is correct, there is probably something else that I miss in rethinkdb raft...\r\n"
