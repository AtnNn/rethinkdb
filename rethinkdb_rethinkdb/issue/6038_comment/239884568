      "@rsantosdev Looking at the logs you sent me, I think yours might be a different issue. As long as there are heartbeat timeouts and disconnects, seeing Raft election timeouts is normal and expected. This issue is about a case where the election timeouts keep happening even after a period of full connectivity. Is that what you are seeing too?\r\nI'd recommend figuring out why the heartbeat timeouts are happening first. Those can be caused by network connectivity issues, or (maybe more likely) by performance issues on the servers. For example swapping on a server can often cause heartbeat timeouts."
