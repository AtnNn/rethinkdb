      "Thanks @ntquyen , got your email. We'll see if we can find anything.\r\n\r\nWhat is the hardware of the servers (disk drives)?\r\n\r\nYou say that the network is quite unstable. Is it possible that it had periods of high latency or high package loss / low throughput?\r\n\r\nWe were wondering if it could have been just fast enough not to trigger another heartbeat timeout (so the servers would on paper stay connected), but too slow to allow the Raft election process to go through in time.\r\nThat wouldn't explain why it started working again after you restarted all servers, but might be something worth looking into."
