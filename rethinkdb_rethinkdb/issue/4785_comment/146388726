      "I disagree with this structure in particular:\r\n\r\n> #Turn plugins on/off on startup (note, no `extend`)\r\n> $ rethinkdb --no-http-admin --graphql\r\n\r\nI think that you should be able to do as @mlucy says and list all currently installed plugins with `rethinkdb plugins list` which will display a list of plugins that are activated or deactivated. It's awkward to add `-no-` to the plugin flag to signify that this plugin should not be loaded.\r\n\r\n> Name Version Active\r\n> graphql 0.1.5  [X]\r\n> falcor    0.9    [  ]\r\n> api  0.1          [X]\r\n^ note it's hard to get the spacing right in Markdown\r\n\r\nOne can activate or deactivate plugins, if everything went okay no response is given in proper GNU tool format.\r\n\r\n> $ rethinkdb plugins activate graphql \r\n> $ rethinkdb plugins deactivate graphql\r\n> $\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to start RethinkDB for debugging purposes with a specific set of plugins, you should also be able to pass an explicit list. RethinkDB will _only_ use these plugins in this instance:\r\n\r\n> $ rethinkdb --plugins graphql,falcor \r\n \r\n\r\n"
