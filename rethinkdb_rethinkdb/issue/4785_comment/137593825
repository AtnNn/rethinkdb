      "This is more similar to ElasticSearch rivers. The main difficulty they had with rivers, and why they're deprecating them, is that it gets into the hairy business of the database becoming a process supervisor for code with varying levels of quality. If the river you installed was buggy, suddenly your database was unreliable.\r\n\r\nTheir little more in-depth discussion is at https://www.elastic.co/blog/deprecating-rivers . It's possible that we can avoid some of the issues they ran into by carefully handling process isolation"
