      "@danielmewes perfect! We have a lot of internal tools where I'd like to be able to allow users to execute (almost) arbitrary queries from the browser. With the client-side JS library and supporting endpoint, all I'd have to do is handle authentication in a proxy. This would also just be great for prototyping single-page apps before you write a backend.\r\n\r\n> ... being able to modify those settings through normal ReQL queries would be extremely useful I think. And we don't need to worry about providing a special API for configuration changes.\r\n\r\nI agree with this. It means you could easily write plugins that \"interact\" with other plugins through ReQL. This way the Web UI (or a third-party) could manage plugins and their configuration. Another nice side affect is that plugin configuration and data could be backed up and restored."
