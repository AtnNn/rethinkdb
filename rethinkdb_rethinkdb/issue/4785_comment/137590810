      "This is very similar to how plugins are [implemented in ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-plugins.html). ElasticSearch has the concept of \"Site Plugins\" whereby the contents of a plugin's `_site` directory are served at `/_plugins/<plugin_name>`. Is something like this what you have in mind for the Web UI and similar plugins?\r\n\r\nIf so, does this imply that connections over HTTP in the JS driver will need to be supported in some official capacity? There's been discussions around dropping that stuff entirely, but such plugins will need some way to execute arbitrary queries."
