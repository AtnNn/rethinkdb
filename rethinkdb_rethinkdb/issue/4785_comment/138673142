      "> If the river you installed was buggy, suddenly your database was unreliable.\r\n\r\nWe can definitely make this better with resource limits for plugins, but I do think that plugins present a general problem that people will install a buggy plugin and then assume RethinkDB is buggy.  (And nobody likes being kicked back and forth between the repo for a plugin and the repo for the main program when they have a bug report.)\r\n\r\nStill, I think it's worth the cost.  We should consider having a way to endorse plugins that we think are stable so that people know what they're getting into."
