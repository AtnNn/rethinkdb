      "I feel like \"extension\" isn't a good name. We aren't really extending the server so much as providing a built-in process monitor. While \"plugin\" isn't perfect, it's closer I think. I'd expect something called an extension to add new ReQL terms or artificial tables with special behavior maybe.\r\n\r\n"
