      "That makes a lot more sense. I was worried it would be a bit of a nightmare if you guys had to manage routing tables, plugin priority, etc yourselves.\r\n\r\nHaving multiple instances of the  authentication \"plugin-helpers\" would be annoying if you had to create a session with each plugin, but this could be solved with a global table-backed session store.\r\n\r\nI still don't see how this would support the logging use-case unless all the plugins are bound to the same (Node.js) server instance, though. Since you'd probably want to capture all requests, not just the requests routed to a single plugin."
