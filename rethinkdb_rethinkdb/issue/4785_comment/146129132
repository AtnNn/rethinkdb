      "Yes, we only plan to support JavaScript plugins in the first version. This is mostly so we can concentrate on one platform and make it work really well.\nLong-term there's no particular technical reason for why we couldn't support extensions/plugins written in other languages as well.\n\nIn fact I think it wouldn't be too hard to specify a generic interface that allows any kind of interpreter to be used for running a RethinkDB extension, though possibly with varying degrees of convenience and integration.\65533\n"
