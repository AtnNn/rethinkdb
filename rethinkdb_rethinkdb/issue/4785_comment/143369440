      "@marshall007 I had thought about these things too.\r\nI'm not sure how this is going to pan out in detail yet, but I imagine that we'll build a library of useful components over time, that you can use easily in your own plugins.\r\n\r\nAuthentication and logging are definitely examples of things that should be re-usable.\r\n\r\nThis can be done almost independently of how plugins are handled on the server side, since those libraries are going to exist in the form of node.js libraries that each plugin can just import. I agree that we should try to provide as many of those out of the box as possible over time. Partially because it makes writing plugins easier, and partially because it makes different plugins more consistent."
