      "Instead of cramming everything under the `rethinkdb` command, the package management stuff could itself be published as an `npm` package. I think this would have several advantages:\r\n\r\n1. Reduce complexity/scope of the `rethinkdb` command.\r\n1. CLI could be a more direct wrapper around `npm`, so extension developers and users already familiar with `npm`s arguments wouldn't have to learn anything new.\r\n1. Have a sweet name like `rpm` or `rem` (ReM).\r\n1. Bug-fixes to the package manager could be shipped/installed independently of core.\r\n\r\nThis is what Atom did for their package manager ([atom/apm](https://github.com/atom/apm)) and it's pretty nice, IMO."
