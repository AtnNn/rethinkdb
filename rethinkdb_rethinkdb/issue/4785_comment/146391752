      "> I also don't like using `--X` to specify `X` where `X` is an action\r\n\r\nNote that this is a cultural thing. I don't necessarily disagree, but that was modelled after `npm`, and that's how `npm` does it (and also to some degree `pip`).\r\n\r\n> We aren't really extending the server so much as providing a built-in process monitor.\r\n\r\nI think that's a little narrow -- it's true about v1, but there are much bigger things we can (and will) do with this system in the future.\r\n\r\n> It's awkward to add `-no-` to the plugin flag to signify that this plugin should not be loaded.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense, but the intention here was to be compatible with the existing flag to turn off the webui. I think I agree with the sentiment in general, though, and wouldn't mind breaking compatibility for this flag (since the new thing will be much more structured and will make more sense).\r\n\r\n> `rethinkdb plugins activate graphql `\r\n\r\nI think for the `graphql` demo we *really* want a one-liner (which I realize is a little bit neurotic, but I do think saying \"get graphql in one line\" is better than giving a two line/command example). Another problem is that saying `rethinkdb plugin activate/deactivate` is tricky because I might have multiple instances of RethinkDB on my server, and it's not clear which server that applies to. "
