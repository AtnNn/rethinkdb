      "> > `rethinkdb plugins activate graphql`\r\n>I think for the graphql demo we really want a one-liner (which I realize is a little bit neurotic, but I do think saying \"get graphql in one line\" is better than giving a two line/command example). Another problem is that saying rethinkdb plugin activate/deactivate is tricky because I might have multiple instances of RethinkDB on my server, and it's not clear which server that applies to.\r\n\r\nI guess this functionality will depend on whether or not the architecture will allow adding plugins to a RethinkDB instance that is already in flight / running. Otherwise, I'd say for specific toggle switching of plugins, you'll need to pass either the driver port or the cluster port explicitly of the instance you are reconfiguring. "
