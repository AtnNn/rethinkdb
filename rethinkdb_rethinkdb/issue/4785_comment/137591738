      "I haven't looked into ElasticSearch site plugins, but they sound superficially similar.\r\n\r\n> If so, does this imply that connections over HTTP in the JS driver will need to be supported in some official capacity?\r\n\r\nSince the plugins will run in a node.js container, they can use the regular JavaScript driver without a need for HTTP connections.\r\nThe browser-side part of the web UI will still need to connect to the plugin somehow though, which might require keeping the current HTTP ReQL connection logic in place for a bit longer.\r\nWhat we can do with the plugins is remove the HTTP endpoint in the (C++) server. Instead the web UI plugin would receive the queries from the browser via HTTP, and would convert them into regular TCP-based ReQL requests before forwarding them to the server."
