      "Will plugins be able to (optionally) defer the handling of requests? I can think of a couple scenarios where this would be useful.\r\n\r\n#### Authentication\r\n\r\nRather than baking authentication into each plugin, it would be a lot nicer if that functionality were split out for reuse. Furthermore, since the authentication piece is pretty critical, it's not really something you want each plugin author implementing themselves.\r\n\r\nYou could imagine \"official\" plugins that implement various authentication schemes like `rethinkdb-oauth` and `rethinkdb-http-basic` which could be configured to intercept and authenticate all or some subset of requests before deferring response handling to the intended receiver plugin.\r\n\r\n#### Logging\r\n\r\nYou might want to intercept requests in order to generate a query log or track performance metrics."
