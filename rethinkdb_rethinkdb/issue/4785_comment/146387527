      "I think you should be able to type `rethinkdb <SOMETHING>` to install and manage extensions, personally.  That's what I would expect to be able to do, and it's consistent with existing extension-like-things like `rethinkdb export`.\r\n\r\nI don't particularly like `rethinkdb extend` as a prefix because `rethinkdb extend --list` reads weirdly, and it isn't clear what you're doing.  I also don't like using `--X` to specify `X` where `X` is an action -- flags should be used for turning options on and off, and actions should be specified as plain words.  (For example, it's `git commit -a`, not `git --commit -a`.  The action is a word and the option is a flag.  Same thing for `apt-get install` -- it's not `apt-get --install`.\r\n\r\nHow about `rethinkdb extension list`, `rethinkdb extension install`, `rethinkdb extension remove`, etc?"
