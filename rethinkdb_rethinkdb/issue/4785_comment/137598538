      "@danielmewes to be clear, I think what you're saying about removing support for HTTP connections from the server makes sense to do. I just think that instead of having the Web UI plugin expose an endpoint for itself, the server (or another plugin) should expose an endpoint that the Web UI and any other plugins can use.\r\n\r\nAlso, changefeeds would still need to be considered. An endpoint that parses and evaluates a plain-text query still wouldn't do you much good here."
