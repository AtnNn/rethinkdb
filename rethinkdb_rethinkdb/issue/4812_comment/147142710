      "I was recently looking for a better way to debug the JSON protocol for my C# driver. I previously used @neumino 's driver tool to help debug AST terms but as mentioned, it's a bit outdated.\r\n\r\nI did find a very decent work around though... I'm using the web-admin console to debug the JSON protocol and AST. I couldn't get @neumino 's  `console.log(query.build())` to work out of the box but I was able to disable the web-admin's refresh timers so I could easily see the network traffic being sent over the wire.\r\n\r\nThe details to disable the web-admin refresh timers are here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver#query-debugging\r\n\r\nBasically once the \"refresh\" timers are disabled, the network tab in the dev console is a lot more quiet. The `?conn_id=value` request payloads have the AST when you hit the **Run** button. Using the web-admin tool is great because you also get a nice view of the data that gets returned.\r\n\r\n![screen511](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/478118/10414140/94b97cb0-6f79-11e5-9ca2-afc35df507f5.png)\r\n\r\nHope that helps,\r\nBrian"
