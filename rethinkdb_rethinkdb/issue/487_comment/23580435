      "If I recall correctly the reason we didn't originally do this is because it's pretty hard to give a meaningful number for latency. When you've got a bunch of different queries hitting the database that can take anywhere from milliseconds to minutes to complete it's hard to present the data in such a way that you actually see what you care about since the 99th percent is probably just going to be your aggregation queries and you'll completely miss it if a write query happens to be slow."
