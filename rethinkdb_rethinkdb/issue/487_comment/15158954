      "Hi @jamwt -- this is a great suggestion and we'll definitely get this in ASAP (the 1.6 release will be about performance, so we'll work on adding addition metrics). I'm moving to backlog for now -- I unfortunately can't get it into 1.5.\r\n\r\nFYI, if you start a rethinkdb server and then go to `http://HOST:WEB_PORT/ajax/stat` you'll get a JSON document with lots of stats about the cluster. Going to `http://HOST:WEB_PORT/ajax` will get you a JSON doc with general information about the cluster state. Posting to the URL will actually have the cluster respond and change its state (that's what the web ui does), but it's a bit advanced and I wouldn't suggest doing it (it's just an interesting bit of info).\r\n\r\nI would *love* to hear more suggestions from you."
