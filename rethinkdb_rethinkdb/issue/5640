        "Hi, i found cursor.next(timeout) is not implemented yet (it is just defined there but ignored timeout parameter)\r\n\r\nSo i'v modified Cursor.java to implement it mainly by\r\n```\r\n res = this.awatingContinue.get();\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\n res = this.awatingContinue.get(timeout, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\r\n``` \r\n\r\nTeste case testQueryTimeout has also been added. All other test cases works well.\r\n\r\nHope you merge it."
