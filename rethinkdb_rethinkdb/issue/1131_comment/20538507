      "@atnnn just showed me the bug.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is probably that when the user hit a quote or an opening parenthesis, we are going to check for the closing match. If the user can somehow hit a key before we can finish the check, I believe the user may see the bug that @atnnn described.\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that @atnnn's machine is pretty slow, so it should be pretty hard to reproduce the bug on a normal machine (at least I can't do it on my laptop).\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll still take a look, there is maybe a stupid bug that slow down the search of the closing quote/parenthesis."
