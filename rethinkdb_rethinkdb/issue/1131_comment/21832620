      "I just looked at it and couldn't find any particular problem.\r\n\r\nI could theoretically improve it, but that's really a lot of work and I think it's not worth doing it because\r\n- I would have to track and match keydown/keypress/keyup -- which is doable even if a little tricky (I would have to sync things with codemirror too which can be even more tricky)\r\n- Sometimes keydown/keypress/keyup event.which don't match -- which can be tricky\r\n- the event don't match across OS and browsers -- which can be tricky too\r\n- It's adding too much code/complexity for a special case. -- That's the main reason I'm reluctant to add more code here. The `handle_keypress` is quite complex already.\r\n\r\nClosing. If other users see this bug under normal circumstances, I'll look at it again and attempt to fix it."
