      "Do you write at normal speed to get these bugs or do you write fast on purpose?\r\n\r\nI can reproduce the `r.expr)(` bug if I write really fast (like hitting the keys almost at the same time), but I can not get the `'foo'` bug.\r\nI'll set up my mac mini to test it on OS X, maybe the bug is easier to trigger.\r\n"
