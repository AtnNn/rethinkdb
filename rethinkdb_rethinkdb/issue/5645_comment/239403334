      "@danielmewes , I think I have found the source of the problem. According to the output, generated by `make` target `build_crypto` fails during LD link stage:\r\n\r\n> /usr/bin/ld: /home/victor/work/rethinkdb/build/external/openssl_1.0.1t/lib/libssl.a(ssl_algs.o): undefined reference to symbol 'EVP_dss1@@OPENSSL_1.0.0'\r\n> //usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.0.0: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line\r\n\r\nHere we may see that LD tries to search DSOs in /usr/lib directory instead of `external` and this is the bug, because when I have tried to launch `make` for the first time **I have not installed libssl-dev** because I knew that it will be fetched by `configure`. So when LD had tried to find proper DSOs it had found them missing from their usual locations and it had not tried to look into `external`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, a quick fix for this issue is to install `libssl-dev` dependency manually via the packet manager, and do not fetch it with `configure`.\r\n\r\nI have tried to locate the corresponding makefile but currently I'm not familiar enough with the source tree of the project; if the bug remains to be not fixed for some time I may work on it in my fork repo later."
