      "@danielmewes , I have also faced this issue when tried to run `make` command.\r\nMy platform is x86_64, OS - Bunsenlabs Linux (based on Debian Jessie).\r\n\r\nI have tried to run `make` with `ALLOW_WARNINGS=1` but the issue still remains. As far as I understand this is not a problem with compilation but a missing DSO name for libcrypto target. \r\n\r\nProbably, this may be a particular issue with the external package, fetched by `configure`."
