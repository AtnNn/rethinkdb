        "This results in space savings for even smallish documents, for several reasons:\n- Englishy language compresses by a factor of 4.\n- We use a whole double to store every number, so arrays of small numbers compress by a factor of 10 (counting protobuf overhead).\n- Our protobuf format has to use multiple type tags for every datum term -- we have a type for the term, then a type for the datum.  Compressing away protobuf overhead alone gives pretty good savings (although this is harder to quantify).\n"
