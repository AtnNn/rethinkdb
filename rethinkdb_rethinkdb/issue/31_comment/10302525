      "I switched to setuptools and added the install_requires argument. Running sdist correctly creates a requires.txt file with the protobuf dependency listed. I also added the \"register\" command to the \"sdist\" and \"upload\" commands we're already running. This supposedly uploads metadata like required packages to PyPI yet when I check the PyPI web UI after uploading the dependency is not listed.\r\n\r\n@rockymeza Do you have any more insight? I'm far from an expert on python packaging and the documentation doesn't seem to be very good."
