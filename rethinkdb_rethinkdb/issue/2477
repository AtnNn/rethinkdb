        "Looking at `do_agnostic_btree_backfill()` in the file `src/btree/backfill.cc`, one can see that the list of current secondary indexes is sent once at the beginning of a backfill.\r\n\r\nSay a secondary index is created on the primary while it is backfilling to a secondary. I think it can happen that the secondary will not be notified about the new secondary index, and it will not create it.\r\nThe same can happen with when a secondary index is dropped while backfilling.\r\n\r\nThe missing indexes will be created once the node with the secondaries is restarted, because that triggers a new backfill.\r\n\r\nThe bug is not super severe since it's easy to recover from.\r\n\r\nA very quick work-around would be to send another index list at the end of a backfill, though some rare race conditions might still remain."
