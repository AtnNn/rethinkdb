      "I can add some more information that may be of interest. The problem with the MemoryPoolAllocator on ARMv7 happens when compiling with -O2. -Os does not cause this problem. Since -Os is like -O2 minus some optimizations it may give you a clue as to what part of your code gets optimized away or optimized wrong using -O2"
