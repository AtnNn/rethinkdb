      "Hi @aranw thanks for the suggestion. This seems like a reasonable idea.\r\n\r\nOne thing you may try in the meantime is to use `r.http` from the dataexplorer to send your data to an external api. Something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.http(\"http://my.receiving.api.com/\", {method=\"POST\", data=r.table('foo').coerceTo('array').toJSON()})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will only work for tables smaller than 100K elements (the array size limit since we're coercing the table to an array), but it may be useful depending on your use case."
