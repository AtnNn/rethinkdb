      "I have a fix for this up in review 1499.  It appears that this was caused by the combination of libcurl using signal handlers and the periodic SIGALRMs we use in the extprocs to check for parent death.  This bug was further obfuscated because it appears it would only occur during DNS lookup, and libcurl has a DNS cache with a 60s timeout.  Therefore, if the timing window wasn't hit on the first attempt, it wouldn't be hit on subsequent attempts.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to specify CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL=1 when configuring libcurl."
