        "Greetings All,\n\nBeing new to RethinkDB, I am trying to get a feel for things by reading over the documentation as well as to run the RethinkDB examples (http://rethinkdb.com/docs/examples/)\n\nOn of the first examples that I have tried is the CatThink example (http://rethinkdb.com/blog/cats-of-instagram/).\n\nI registered with Instagram and loaded up an instance of RethinkDB on my test server along with installing nodejs, but it seems that node will run the app.js, but it will not connect with Instagram.\n\nHas anyone gotten this example to run recently, or is there another similar example that will demonstrate RethinkDB being able to externally connect to external API servers that I would download and try?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCheers and have a great day,\nLonnie\n"
