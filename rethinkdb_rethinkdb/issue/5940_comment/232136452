      "@mbroadst Does this go away if you lower the `squash` value (to let's say 1s)?\r\n\r\nI suspect it's waiting on the squash timeout, and whether that happens or not depends more or less on random timing. If all modifications get into the first batch, they are sent immediately. But if one of them is processed slightly later, it will have to wait the full 1,000,000 seconds (or until the changefeed queue gets close to full, e.g. by generating additional changes through the `delete`).\r\n\r\nIs this based on one of our tests? It seems fragile, and I'm not sure if it should be there.\r\n\r\nAlso pinging @mlucy in case I'm misunderstanding something."
