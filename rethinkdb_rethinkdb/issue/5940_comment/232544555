      "I've got a few more here:\r\n* https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/test/rql_test/src/mutation/insert.yaml#L183\r\nI'm actually pretty sure this test isn't run because it's not valid python (`true` != `True`), but also because when converting it to valid python I get the same results as the C++ and javascript drivers (what you would expect): the returned changes are _not_ an empty array `[]`.  The aforementioned `true` issue is present in a number of other tests, I wonder if these are silently failing somehow?\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/test/rql_test/src/mutation/insert.yaml#L179\r\nThis test is just sort of a bummer because it depends on data left in the table from the previous run (see the expected result as having a \"Duplicate primary key `id`\"), when that's not really critical to the functionality it's purportedly testing.\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/test/rql_test/src/changefeeds/table.yaml#L66\r\nThis is the final hurdle to full test suite compliance for the C++ driver, and I can't find any reference whatsoever to there being a hard coded array limit size of 90 in the python driver. If someone could point me to that I would really appreciate it, and we can ensure the same guarantee in the C++ driver.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
