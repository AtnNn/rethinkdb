      "Hi @orthecreedence, thanks for reporting this.\r\n\r\nThis looks like a memory pressure issue to me. How much RAM is on the linode node? Do you have a sense for how much data is in RethinkDB? It looks like RethinkDB might simply be running out of RAM. We recommend at least 2GB of RAM in production deployments, anything lower than that will almost certainly cause issues like this when the dataset gets big enough.\r\n\r\nI'll keep the issue open until you reply. Also, I think we'll catch the `bad_alloc` exception at the root and try to print a friendlier error message so people don't have to guess what's going on."
