      "@coffeemug the server has 1024MB (about half of it free), the database itself is storing probably around 25MB tops (and is currently using ~100MB in memory). It's the primary db for a relatively small (small traffic, small amount of data) app. I did *not* get a look at the resource usage before the crash happened, so you may be right, it could have been out of memory.\r\n\r\n@atnnn I'll recompile in the next day or two with those flags and see if I can get it to happen again. This has only happened once so far out of weeks of usage, so it might be a while before it happens again."
