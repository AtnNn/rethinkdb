      "I've tried replacing the std::map with a boost::unordered_map already. It didn't help overall performance in a measurable way.\r\nAlso mind that the map insert in general takes only a fraction of the datum_t creation time (see original post).\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: coffeemug <notifications@github.com>\r\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 2013 18:29:30 \r\nTo: rethinkdb/rethinkdb<rethinkdb@noreply.github.com>\r\nReply-To: rethinkdb/rethinkdb <reply@reply.github.com>\r\nCc: Daniel Mewes<danielmewes@onlinehome.de>\r\nSubject: Re: [rethinkdb] cJSON -> datum_t conversion is slooow (#1042)\r\n\r\nI think that relies on the assumption that a BSON library can just copy a serialized format into memory and make it accessible as a hash-table (and not require copying into a map or hash map). I don't know whether that's true (we should check), but that seems unlikely. A good memory format for random access is almost certainly different from a good disk format.\r\n\r\nWe should at least try switching to a hash map (basically `unordered_map` in C++). We might see a huge performance improvement with basically no work.\r\n\r\n---\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1042#issuecomment-19725896\r\n\r\n"
