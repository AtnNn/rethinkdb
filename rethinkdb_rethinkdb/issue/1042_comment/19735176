      "It is actually even just an eighth of the total, and a quarter of init_json().\r\n\r\nMaybe my tests were not elaborate enough to expose any performance advantages of the hash map (I just ran the overall query 10 times in a row and averaged over the processing time. Each execution of the query took ~4.7 seconds for the pure getAll() query). But in any case, it would only be a small contribution to the overall performance.\r\n\r\nThe profiling results are on deadshot and can be viewed with\r\n    kcachegriend /home/daniel/rethinkdb/oprof/calltree-trakio.out\r\n\r\n(requires X, use ssh -X)\r\n\r\nA script which runs the corresponding query is in /home/daniel/php-tests/trakio-plain.php .\r\nThere is also a variant trakio-getAll.php which runs only the getAll (followed by a filter(false) to make sure that the measurements were not diluted by networking code). The data (for RethinkDB 1.5) is in /home/daniel/trak-io/rethinkdb_data also on deadshot.\r\n\r\nThe profiling was done against rethinkdb 1.5.2."
