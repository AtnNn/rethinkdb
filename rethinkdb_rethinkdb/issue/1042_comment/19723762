      "Even if we get rid of CJSON, we'll still have to instantiate datum_t objects from the serialized representations on disk. Since what seems to make this process slow is inserting fields into an std::map, simply replacing CJSON with something else will not solve this performance problem. This issue should really be about optimizing the construction of datum_t's."
