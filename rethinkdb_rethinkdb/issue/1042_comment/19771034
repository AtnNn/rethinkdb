      "@coffeemug I was thinking that was what BSON did but I'm not sure. There are things that do that though I believe or we could make something that does that ourselves.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes I wouldn't really expect using an `unordered_map` to have much effect. `std::map` is very optimized and the difference between `O(n)` and `O(n log n)` isn't going to be that noticeable with the size of `n` we deal with here."
