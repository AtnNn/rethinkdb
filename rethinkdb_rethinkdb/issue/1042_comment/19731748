      "If I read the original post correctly, we're only spending 41% of 58% of our time (about a quarter of the total) in `std::map`.  Moreover, we go back and forth between `datum_t` and JSON a lot, so we're probably doing that work more times than we need to.  I think we should just strip out cJSON, since we know that we need to do that to be fast, then run the benchmarks again and see what the second biggest problem is."
