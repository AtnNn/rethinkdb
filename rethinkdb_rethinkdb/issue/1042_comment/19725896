      "I think that relies on the assumption that a BSON library can just copy a serialized format into memory and make it accessible as a hash-table (and not require copying into a map or hash map). I don't know whether that's true (we should check), but that seems unlikely. A good memory format for random access is almost certainly different from a good disk format.\r\n\r\nWe should at least try switching to a hash map (basically `unordered_map` in C++). We might see a huge performance improvement with basically no work."
