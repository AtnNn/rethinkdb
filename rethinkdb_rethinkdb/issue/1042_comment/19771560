      "Objects in RQL are technically immutable right? We might be able to build an immutable map type with a low memory footprint that is quick to initialize and copy if we didn't have to support inserts. I suppose it depends on the user's data, but most RQL objects seem to have only a handful of keys. We could probably get away with linear lookup too."
