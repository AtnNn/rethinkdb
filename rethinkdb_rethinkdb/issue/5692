        "In 2.3 we ended up disallowing system table access for non-admin users for simplicity reasons.\n\nCopying the original proposal from https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5463 here:\n- Read permissions on system tables will be assigned through the usual mechanism (i.e. the \"rethinkdb\" database is treated like any other database)\n- Nobody can write to a system table, except for the `admin` user who can write to all system tables\n- One exception from the rule: Users can update their own document in the `users` table, as long as they have read and write permissions on the `users` table as granted through the usual mechanism.\n\nNote that operations such as `r.table(...).config().update(...)` or `r.table(...).reconfigure(...)` can still be performed by non-admin users, if the user has `config` permissions on the affected table.\n\nAdditionally we should filter `jobs` output so users only see their own queries unless they are `admin`.\n"
