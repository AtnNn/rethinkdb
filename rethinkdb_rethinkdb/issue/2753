This isn't the case in 1.13.x (we checked).\r\n\r\nIt's possible I broke this in the point-changefeeds CR, but I'm not sure how I could have.\r\n\r\n@timmaxw, @srh, @danielmewes -- did any of you make any changes to how reads are routed since 1.13.x that might lead to changefeed servers being created on both replicas rather than just the master?"
