      "@felixis-1 Unfortunately we don't have a schedule for this currently.\r\n\r\nSince ReQL doesn't support recursion or non-functional loops at the moment, it's probably tricky to calculate strongly connected nodes directly in ReQL. It might be possible somehow, but I suspect that it's significantly easier to do it in a piece of application code that runs multiple ReQL queries to request the next set of nodes from the graph."
