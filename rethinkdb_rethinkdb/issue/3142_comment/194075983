      "I support too the idea for rethinkdb to be a multi model db by adding graph capabilities and so, go beyond too simple relationships management such exposed here https://rethinkdb.com/docs/data-modeling/.\r\nI were asked on slack to a bring the specific use case i exposed on slack : \r\n\r\nBased on betting exchange gaming, players match their bets (at a given stake and odd) with others players. There a lot of cross relationships in that just simple scenario for which graph capabilities help a lot in a simple and natural way (if possible with sort of ACID transaction).\r\n"
