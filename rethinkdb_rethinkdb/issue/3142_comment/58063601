      "@danielmewes I was thinking on simple use cases such as \"Select all documents that are connected to document A\" and a directed graph like \"Select all users who added user A as friend but is not on user A's friend list\". Some of the other document databases such as Arangodb have this and even Postgresql is capable of graph modelling. Would be nice for Rethinkdb to have these features but in the spirit of Rethinkdb in terms of efficiency and orthogonality."
