      "Hi @pengux,\r\ndo you have a specific use case in mind? Which operations would you expect to be able to (efficiently) perform on those collections?\r\n\r\nRethinkDB hasn't been designed as a graph database the way some other specialized products have. That doesn't mean however that we couldn't add features to make small-scale graph processing possible in RethinkDB at some point."
