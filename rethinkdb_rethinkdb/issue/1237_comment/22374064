      "Blobs intrinsically cannot support a blob ref that is more than 10 bytes larger than `get_block_size().value() - sizeof(block_magic_t)`.  At least not without a significant increase in implementational complexity.\r\n\r\n So I'm going to add a guarantee that the maxreflen is less than such a value.\r\n\r\nRight now we have a blob stored in a block that doesn't use a block magic value at all.  That's why this bug was exhibited.  I'm going to make that block contain a block magic value."
