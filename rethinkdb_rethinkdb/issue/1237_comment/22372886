      "The offending code seems to be\r\n`memcpy(blob::small_buffer(ref_, maxreflen_), b, maxreflen_ - blob::big_size_offset(maxreflen_));` at line 855 in the blob.cc file. That is the memcpy call producing the valgrind error or segfault.  It's assuming that it can just fill up the blob reference buffer with noise from the blob buffer, when removing a level.  This doesn't work when the copy size pushes you off the end of the blob buffer.  There's a second offending memcpy call in the same function."
