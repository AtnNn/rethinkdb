      "I think our current storage engine is actually really good (it also supports range-based queries btw).\r\n\r\nEventually this will likely happen, but it's not a priority at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a side note: John Lakos appears to talk about the costs of maintaining the subsystem. Reducing that doesn't necessarily reduce the cost of maintaining the overall system (the sum of all subsystems if you will). Certain things actually become more difficult if you have less control over some subsystems. That being said keeping subsystems separate is still usually a good idea because it reduces the likelihood of bugs and improves testability."
