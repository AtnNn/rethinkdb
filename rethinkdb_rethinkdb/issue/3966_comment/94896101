      "@stephanos: I hesitate to mention this since it is not really public, and I have to stress that it could go away at any time and is totally unsupported... but we do have a memory-only table for our own debugging use: `rethinkdb._debug_scratch`.\r\n\r\nI would never be comfortable using it for anything other than testing (we use it for testing artificial tables without side effects), but it is there for that purpose and it might serve your needs."
