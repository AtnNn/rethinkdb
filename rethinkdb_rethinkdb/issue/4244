        "On `the-shadow` (our slowest test machine) I am getting a failures that look like timing problems. Specifically it looks like a backfill is not running a half second after the `reconfigure` that should cause it. Rather than checking only a single time at a fixed time after a trigger event we should loop this test, succeeding if we see the correct values once, and otherwise failing after some timeout. This pattern gets us farther aways form having our timing set to the behavior of a specific machine.\n"
