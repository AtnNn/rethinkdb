      "Let's limit the scope of this issue so it's actually closable. To close this issue we'll need:\r\n\r\n* Get the heap profiler working and printing heap graphs on a 32-bit system (otherwise we just fly blind)\r\n* Find out the reason why range filters are so memory hungry and filters after counts behave differently than filters without counts.\r\n* Fix the obvious blunders we discover when we run the heap profiler against the unexplained case in the point above\r\n\r\n@wmrowan has been working on this for a while, moving to sprint 3."
