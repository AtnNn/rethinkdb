      "I think we decided against the `cluster_id` thing because what some people do is:\r\n* They start up a RethinkDB node to test the command-line arguments.\r\n* That works.\r\n* They shut down the node and restart it with `--join` to have it join the actual cluster.\r\n\r\nIf we did the `cluster_id` thing, that pattern would produce an error."
