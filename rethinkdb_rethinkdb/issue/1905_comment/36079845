Ok, they were almost empty, but still, it's bad because\r\n- I now have conflicts name in the web ui (and there is no friendly way to solve them -- reading a uuid is not friendly).\r\n- The flow is what a new user could easily do (start rethinkdb on M1, start rethinkdb on M2 without join, realize that I forgot to join M1, restart rethinkDB on M2 with join, get conflict) -- basically https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/301\r\n\r\n"
