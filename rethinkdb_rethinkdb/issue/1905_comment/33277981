      "Isn't it easy to fix with a `cluster_id`?\r\nIf it's not a lot of work, I think it's worth fixing before the LTS.\r\n\r\nA reasonable thing that could happen is:\r\n- The user is a cluster \"test\" and a cluster \"production\".\r\n- The user wants to move an instance (from let's say the \"test\" cluster) from a machine A to machine B (a new machine)\r\n- He takes down the cluster \"test\", copy the data directory from A to B\r\n- He somehow messes up the new config file (he connects the machine to the cluster \"production\")\r\nAnd then he ends up with one meta-cluster with tons of issues."
