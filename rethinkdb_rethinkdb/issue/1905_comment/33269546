      "I believe we discussed this before, but I haven't found if there was already an issue for it.  I think the solution I would try is a `cluster_id` that connected nodes share, such that if two nodes with differing `cluster_id`s try to connect, they refuse the connection.  There are probably some racy corner cases that would need handling, but I think it could work."
