      "We've noticed that this is still useful for the Raft-based release.\r\nSpecifically assume that we have servers store a (non-authorative) local list of all tables and servers that are currently in the cluster (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3594#issuecomment-70341857). Then joining together two clusters that don't belong together would still be a significant annoyance to clean up afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is something like this:\r\nServers without any data can always join a cluster and take on the cluster id from the cluster they're connecting to.\r\nIf you try joining a server that has data to a cluster with a different cluster ID, you would get an error.\r\n\r\nPresumably we would also allow manually setting the cluster id on the command line as well as overriding the check."
