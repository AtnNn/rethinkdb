      "On YCSB's read-only workload with 64 concurrent clients, fixing this for the protobuf protocol gives us 10% more throughput (on localhost, probably more if the server was on an actual network).\r\n\r\nThe protocol buffer protocol only uses two writes, not three like the JSON protocol so I expect the difference to be even higher there."
