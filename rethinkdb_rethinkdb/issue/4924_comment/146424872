      "@danielmewes -- I think a client closing a changefeed should never result in an exception (even if there is data in it). The only time an error should be thrown is if someone else closes the feed (e.g. via jobs, killing the server, interrupted network, etc.) It sounds like @Tryneus's patch inadvertently changed the semantics (incorrectly).\r\n\r\n/cc @mlucy "
