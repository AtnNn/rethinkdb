      "@coffeemug it doesn't seem to be affecting my actual production system, only the tests - so I would say not a critical fix. Of course, it prevents me from actually running that suite of integration tests so I would say it's non-trivial at least.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is any sort of tracing you'd like me to do on my side to better illuminate the issue."
