      "@danielmewes I'll say for starters that this didn't happen in 2.1.3, but yes on the cleanup of my test cases I call `close` on two changefeeds. This error is being thrown as a result of that operation. Are you suggesting that maybe extra data is coming in and that's why I'm getting the error?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why calling close on these change feeds should throw an error, and I definitely agree that `rethinkdb.jobs` is a misleading error message"
