      "@mbroadst To make sure I understand: this error is reported on a changefeed that `closed` was called on it?\r\n\r\nIf that's true, this seems pretty close to the expected behavior.\r\nExcept that the message is a bit off, since it's talking about the `rethinkdb.jobs` table even though `close` was used to abort the changefeed."
