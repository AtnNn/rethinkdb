      "I think I thought about the usage scenario wrong.\r\nI think in JavaScript `close`ing the cursor is actually the only way to terminate a changefeed isn't it?\r\n\r\nI agree that it shouldn't generate an error then, but just stop calling the callback, and in case `each` is used, call the `onFinishedCallback`.\r\n\r\nSo I think we're on the same page that this is a server regression."
