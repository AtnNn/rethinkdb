      "Well, I think we want *some* limit, since you can't spawn a billion coroutines and expect RethinkDB to function.  In that case throttling changefeeds is probably what we want.\r\n\r\nHow many coroutines can RethinkDB handle while still being fairly responsive?  Let's just use like half that number and call it a day."
