      "I really don't think anyone's code was compared to vomit here. Referring to printing a lot of unintelligible output as \"vomitting\" is a pretty standard phrase that I've heard. It really isn't a criticism of the code. And I guess I can see how adding multiple question marks to a title is unnecessary but abrasive really seems like a bit of a stretch."
