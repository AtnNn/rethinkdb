      "@jdoliner -- I agree that I don't think this issue is overly egregious, but there are two caveats:\r\n\r\n* It isn't an isolated issue today, nor in general. I've tried treating issues like this individually with limited success, so from now on I've decided to treat it as an aggregate problem.\r\n* While I don't think anything here is particularly insulting, it's dangerously close to a slippery slope, and I'd like to stay as far away from it as possible. Or, as @mlucy says, some rules need to be absolute or they don't work at all.\r\n\r\nI'd really appreciate if we put this behind us and didn't debate it further. People are waiting on us to do our job, so let's just do it. Our users don't care to see any of this."
