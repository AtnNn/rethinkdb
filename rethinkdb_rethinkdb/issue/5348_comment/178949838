      "Thanks for reporting this.\r\n\r\nA side question not directly related to the bug: Do you have the tool `addr2line` installed on your server? It's weird that it gets stuck after crashing and doesn't print a Backtrace. This used to be an issue if `addr2line` wasn't installed, though I thought we had fixed that in 2.2.4. Maybe the fix isn't working properly though, so I think installing `addr2line` might help for getting better information if this happens again.\r\n\r\nAbout the actual crash:\r\nHave you retried the import? If yes, has it succeeded on the second attempt or happened again? I'm asking to find out if this is reproducible.\r\n\r\nCan you check if RethinkDB left a `core` file? That would help us with debugging the issue."
