      "@Sxw1212 only 6 MB free might be enough to cause an out-of-memory crash like this one. If you aren't setting an explicit cache size already, you can start `rethinkdb` with the `--cache-size 32` parameter (or add it to your instance configuration in /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d as `cache-size=32` if you're using the init script to start Rethink). That will reduce memory usage a little bit."
