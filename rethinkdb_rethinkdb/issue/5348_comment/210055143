      "This is now happening at least daily on a single machine we're using for a large migration. We have the cache size set to 32 MB to reduce memory use, as the DB is only receiving writes (decently sized documents at say 1000 per minute), and occasional very simple reads.\r\n\r\nThe dataset is quite large (around half a terabyte) and on pretty wimpy hardware (8GB memory), but when it isn't crashed it's more than enough for the queries hitting it."
