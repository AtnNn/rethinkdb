      "Thanks for the report @mick-h .\r\n\r\nThe memory usage depends on a number of factors, only one of them being the cache size. For example large overall data sets use additional memory. The same is true if you have a lot of tables, or if you run particular memory-heavy queries (more details: https://rethinkdb.com/docs/memory-usage/). Could one of those factors explain the high memory consumption in your case?\r\n\r\nI think running out of memory could theoretically cause segmentation faults like this one, but I'm not convinced that there isn't another bug.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we have not been able to reproduce this ourselves so far, which makes debugging this very hard. We'll keep looking into it."
