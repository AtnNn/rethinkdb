      "Unless we find a way to reliably reproduce this, I don't think there's much chance we can fix this before 1.11. This bug seems very dubious, meaning I cannot find a possible execution path that could lead to this right now.\r\n\r\nI don't think what I wrote above about empty state_old extents could ever happen.\r\nAnother possibility would be a block of size 0. But that also doesn't sound like it would be possible, does it?"
