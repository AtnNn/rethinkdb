      "So this logic *should* be completely above the merger serializer change, and even more so it *should* be separated from anything secondary index by at least like two other layers.\r\n\r\nThe only theory I have is that somehow a completely empty extent was marked as `gc_entry_t::state_old`.  Because the guarantee checks for `<` rather than `<=`, that would trip it. Depending on time constraints, we could decide to just handle that case correctly, rather than crashing.\r\n\r\nHowever probably no empty extent should ever be marked as state_old, so if it is there could be a bug or race condition somewhere else."
