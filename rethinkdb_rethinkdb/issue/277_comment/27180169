      "I've started trying to implement this, but I've hit a bit of a snag. In debug mode, the watchdog code uses rdtsc as a high-resolution timer. This is not portable, and in particular, there is no real equivalent on ARM. My plan for now is to fake it by attempting to measure nanoseconds instead of cycles, pretending that they are the same thing, using clock_gettime. Would anyone like to chime in on this?"
