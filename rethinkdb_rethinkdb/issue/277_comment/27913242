      "@davidthomas426 -- I know there is still an optimization issue, we just wanted an ARM branch to play with in the meantime :) Also, I just commented on stack overflow with some ideas on how to get this fixed.\r\n\r\nI sent you a separate e-mail a day or so ago (to the e-mail on your github profile). If you didn't get it, could you shoot me an e-mail to slava@rethinkdb.com ?"
