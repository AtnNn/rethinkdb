      "@presidentbeef -- that makes sense, but consider the following:\r\n\r\n1. The document will have to be parsed somewhere. You'll have to pay the time penalty whether the document gets parsed on the client or on the server (and it's arguably better to pay this penalty on the client because clients are always easier to scale than servers).\r\n2. If `r.json` sends the JSON document to the server to be parsed, it has to send it as text, which is far less efficient than sending it as binary (which is what would happen if you first preparsed it on the client).\r\n3. We can have `r.json` simply parse json on the client, but then it's equivalent to calling `JSON.parse(str)` by you. I actually don't mind that, and it seems like the best solution.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? What do you think?"
