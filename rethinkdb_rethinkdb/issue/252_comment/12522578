      "It seems that in this case you actually need more control for json parsing on the client (i.e. to pull out specific bits you need). Once you have pulled them out, it's pretty easy to parse those bits and send them to the server. It seems a bit counterproductive to rely on the RethinkDB server to parse json when you actually want to do something specific.\r\n\r\nI'm going to pass the buck on this one to @wmrowan and @mlucy since they understand the intricacies much better, but I personally think this use case is actually a good reason *not* to expose json parsing through the server. (I'm however not opposed to aliasing `r.json` to a client-side json parsing call)."
