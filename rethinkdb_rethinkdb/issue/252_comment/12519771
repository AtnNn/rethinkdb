      "The languages we have drivers for all have good libraries that parse JSON into native datatypes, and `r.expr` / `r()` will parse those native datatypes into RQL datatypes.  So in Ruby, for instance, you just have to write `r(JSON.parse(str))` instead of `r.json(str)`.\r\n\r\nIf you think it's a much better user experience, though, it wouldn't be hard to preserve the functionality in the new driver and document it properly.  I'll leave the call up to @coffeemug ."
