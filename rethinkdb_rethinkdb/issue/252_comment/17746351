      "You still have to parse and instantiate the entire document client-side before sending to the server if you don't have access to something like `r.json`. On the server the documents can be directly converted to rdb types (right?), which seems more efficient.\r\n\r\nShoot, was this removed already? That's going to make my upgrade less happy."
