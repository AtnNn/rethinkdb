      "@jdoliner -- looking at the previous comments I'm not 100% sure what your objections are; I actually seem to be the one initially objecting to it.  I agree that re-opening old issues sucks (for which I apologize), but I think new information has come up which tips the balance on this one.\r\n\r\nI see it like this:\r\n* Benefits\r\n  - Has been useful to at least one power-user.\r\n  - Will let us make import/export not suck very quickly and easily, at least for the next few versions.  (At some point we will probably deviate sufficiently from JSON that it will cease to be useful for this.)\r\n  - Languages with bad JSON handling tools can still insert JSON documents into RethinkDB quickly and easily.\r\n* Costs\r\n  - Requires us to keep the ability to parse JSON.\r\n\r\nI previously judged that the cost outweighed the benefits, but since then:\r\n* I realized that we probably won't get rid of cJSON on the server entirely (at least not in the near future) because it's used outside the RQL layer (e.g. for communicating with the web UI).\r\n* It has become apparent that our import/export tool is actually painfully slow (we get something like 10 kb/sec all told after tuning the batch sizes).\r\n\r\n(We wrote the import/export tool to use the drivers rather than integrating it into the server because it was an order of magnitude easier and safer than the other options we could think of.)\r\n\r\n"
