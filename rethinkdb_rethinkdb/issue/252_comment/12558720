      "@jdoliner On your first point, yes, we've always supported `r.json` though it was only used through `r.expr`. We preferred native RDB types through `r.expr` though and the `r.json` code path was never invoked because we anyways supported all the JSON types natively. Thus it was quickly made superfluous.\r\n\r\nOn your second point, yes, we seem to have proposed more or less the same thing. I can't tell you how many times this has happened to me when replying to comments on git hub. I can only wish our discussions weren't so asynchronous (especially when we're sitting but 3 meters from each other).\r\n\r\nThe idea seems to be to solve the JSON parsing problem by implementing JSON parsing ourselves both bypassing bad parsers and allowing us to optimize for conversion directly to RDB types."
