      "I think we should look at this from 2 different usage models:\r\n\r\n1. API level\r\n2. data import tools\r\n\r\nFor both these scenarios, I actually think JSON parsing should always happen on the client side, as there are quite a few problems with doing it server side:\r\n\r\n1. people could start streaming in anything that might look like json and is not\r\n2. the server would need to use a stream parser in order to protect against running out of memory\r\n3. with stream parsers, the behavior of mutation operations (insert, update, replace) becomes unpredictable depending on the correctness of both the stream and network characteristics "
