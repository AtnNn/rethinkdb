      "@jdoliner -- this has nothing to do with the migration script. For all three of our clients we hit 100% cpu utilization client-side for anything but most trivial documents because of performance problems of protobuf libraries (they're really bad at serializing big protobufs and our size comes from document sizes). We could spend weeks or months trying to optimize protocol libraries or we could implement `r.json` on the server in a day and solve this problem for the next foreseeable future."
