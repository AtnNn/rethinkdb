      "The `maybe-uninitialized` error is very likely to be cause by GCC being overzealous. There's an issue here regarding `boost::optional<T>` and a similar error, https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47679, and `WebKit` has reportedly disabled the warning as well, https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119835.\r\n\r\n@AtnNn -- how can we detect the `-Wno-maybe-uninitialized` option and set it when present?"
