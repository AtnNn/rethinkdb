      "Ah I probably just found that it was needed on Linux, but caused an issue when compiling with Clang on Mac so I added the `__APPLE__` check. Maybe that was the wrong check. Does GCC on OS X use the same C++ standard library as Clang?\r\n\r\nChecking for GCC or not is also not right, since the `using std::signbit` seems to be fine with Clang on Linux. We could just check for `#if !defined(__APPLE__) || defined(__GNUC__)` I suppose, though it's probably still not *exactly* what we should check for here."
