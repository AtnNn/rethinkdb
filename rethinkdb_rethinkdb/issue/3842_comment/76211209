      "@chrisvariety, have you checked the version of your RethinkDB Python driver with `pip freeze`?\r\n\r\nIf you're running an older version of the driver (< `1.16.0-2`), you should upgrade the driver:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo pip install -U rethinkdb\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe import/export script relies on the Python driver installed. If that doesn't help, it I suspect you're running into #3261, but @Tryneus will know more. Sorry you ran into this!"
