      "Yep, this looks like it's due to an old driver.  The import script from before `1.16` doesn't know about the admin tables and will try to export/import them.  With the 1.16 backup scripts, we changed it to refuse to export/import those tables (this is also why the 1.16 backup scripts won't connect to older instances of rethinkdb).\r\n\r\nThis is just another reason we should package the backup scripts with the server."
