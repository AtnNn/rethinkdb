        "Is there any plans to use transducers in order to generate queries? Transducers are awesome, it separates query (manipulation) from the source of data (array, eventstreams ect.). It could be considered as a way to reuse your queries in different contexts. So if I'm developing service which will allow user to filter over things, at some point I must decide, either I want to filter data on client (from cache) or on the server (or both). Or I have another datasource and I wish to filter data as it comes."
