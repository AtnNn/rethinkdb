      "I don't quite trust the assumption that this is a low-impact issue for systems with local storage. Part of `set_size()` is to perform a data sync. What if other expensive write operations are going on at the same time? The data sync would have to wait for those as well.\r\nAnd of course many people are running RethinkDB on virtualized machines with network storage...\r\n\r\nThus, I implemented the logic for pushing down the resize operations into the I/O pool. The implementation is in branch daniel_265. I would like to think about it for a few more days before putting it into code review. Correctness is very critical here. So far it seems to work though."
