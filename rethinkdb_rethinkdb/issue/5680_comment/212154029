      "@thelinuxlich We discontinued Wheezy packages with 2.3.0 as mentioned in the release notes. The reason is that RethinkDB now required GCC 4.8 to compile, and we couldn't find any backports for Debian Wheezy. :-(\r\n\r\nRethinkDB can be compiled with GCC 4.8 from jessie, but it will also require a more recent libc, so we can't easily pack it that way. Using GCC packages from Ubuntu comes with similar issues."
