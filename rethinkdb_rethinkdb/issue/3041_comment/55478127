      "One possible cause of this is disk corruption. RethinkDB assumes that if it calls `fdatasync()`, the data is guaranteed to be preserved even in case of a power failure. If that assumption is violated, you can see this error message (like in #2723, for example). We've had problems with the Linux kernel drivers for ext4 in the past, and you are also running in a VM, so there's a chance that it's caused by a bug somewhere in that stack.\r\n\r\nHowever, this could also be due to a bug within RethinkDB. If you haven't overwritten your `rethinkdb_data` directory yet, would you be willing to send us a copy so we can use it to diagnose the problem? @mglukhovsky can arrange a secure upload site."
