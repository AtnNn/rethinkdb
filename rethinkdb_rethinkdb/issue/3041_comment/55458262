Could you tell us a bit more about the system you're running RethinkDB on?\r\n\r\n* Is the database on an SSD or rotational storage?\r\n* What file system is the RethinkDB data on? Are you using any special mount options?\r\n* Are you running on a virtual or virtualized machine?\r\n* Does the error occur every time you try to start RethinkDB?\r\n* Do you have irreplaceable data in the database? (We may be able to help you recover it.)"
