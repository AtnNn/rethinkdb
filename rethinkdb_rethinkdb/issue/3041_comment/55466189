      "> Is the database on an SSD or rotational storage?\r\n\r\nSSD\r\n\r\n> What file system is the RethinkDB data on? Are you using any special mount options?\r\n\r\next4 ... It's running inside Docker (Ubuntu 14.04 base) (in Vagrant) and has a data volume mounted.\r\n\r\n> Are you running on a virtual or virtualized machine?\r\n\r\nYes. Vagrant via VirtualBox\r\n\r\n> Does the error occur every time you try to start RethinkDB?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n> Do you have irreplaceable data in the database? (We may be able to help you recover it.)\r\n\r\nThis was a local dev machine, so it's fine to destroy. :)"
