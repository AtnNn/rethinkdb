        "When servers detect a netsplit (with reql_admin) they generate a message in `rethinkdb.issues` and in that message there is a `info` section which is a little unclear, for example:\n\n``` python\n'info': {'affected_servers': ['node_0'], 'server': 'node_1'}\n```\n\nThis was generated by a server (`node_0`) that was isolated from the other server in its cluster (`node_`). My initial reading of this was that it is reversed from what is should be reporting. @chipotle made the suggestion that `affected_servers` should better be called `reporting_servers`, and that what is called `server` might better be called `affected_servers` (and be an array as well).\n\nI don't have a list of all of the message types, but it might be worth re-considering hoisting these two fields out of `info` into the top level item, since every message should be reported by one or more servers and be about one or more servers.\n\nNote: if this is changed then the `interface.detect_netsplit` test should be adjusted to match.\n"
