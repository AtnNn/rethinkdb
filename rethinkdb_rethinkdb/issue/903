        "Hi\r\n\r\nI am looking at content of files at http://download.rethinkdb.com/dist and see that precompiled/web folders contain \"pristine\" javascript. Is there any reason not compile it with closure compiler before creating the distribution file?\r\n\r\nIf we want to force compile the files at user-side then users should install java. It is less not an ideal solution for Linux Arch/Gentoo users who compile project at their machines.\r\n\r\nIMHO precompiled/web should be processed by closure compiler, so Arch will avoid build dependency on java.\r\n\r\nPS on a related note. Currently main page serves 6 css files and more than a dozen of javascript. What about merging all javascript/css files into a bundle and serve it as a one file? Less HTTP requests - better load time is."
