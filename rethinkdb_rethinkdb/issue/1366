        "Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- start 2 servers\r\n- create a table\r\n- insert 40 documents\r\n- split the table into 2 shards\r\n- kill one of the servers\r\n\r\nAn issue appears in the web UI. It simply says:\r\n\r\n```\r\nServer down! Bane is unreachable.\r\nThis server is responsible for the following shards:\r\n    Table foo for the shard b7663ea1... to +\8734\r\n```\r\n\r\n- click on *declare dead*\r\n\r\n```\r\nAre you sure you want to declare Bane dead?\r\n```\r\n\r\n- yes\r\n\r\n```\r\nAll issues have been successfully resolved.\r\nYou successfully declared server dead.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe table now contains only 20 documents.\r\n\r\nI think the messages should have an additional warning, something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nServer down! Bane is unreachable.\r\nThis server is responsible for the following shards:\r\n    Table foo for the shard b7663ea1... to +\8734\r\n    DECLARING THIS SERVER DEAD WILL CAUSE ALL DATA FROM THIS SHARD TO BE COMPLETELY LOST.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nAre you sure you want to declare Bane dead?\r\nTHE DATA FROM ONE OF THE SHARDS OF TABLE FOO WILL BE COMPLETELY LOST.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nYou have declared the server to be dead,\r\nTHE DATA FROM ONE OF THE SHARDS OF TABLE FOO HAS BEEN COMPLETELY LOST.\r\n```"
