        "Steps to reproduce:\n- start 2 servers\n- create a table\n- insert 40 documents\n- split the table into 2 shards\n- kill one of the servers\n\nAn issue appears in the web UI. It simply says:\n\n```\nServer down! Bane is unreachable.\nThis server is responsible for the following shards:\n    Table foo for the shard b7663ea1... to +\8734\n```\n- click on _declare dead_\n\n```\nAre you sure you want to declare Bane dead?\n```\n- yes\n\n```\nAll issues have been successfully resolved.\nYou successfully declared server dead.\n```\n\nThe table now contains only 20 documents.\n\nI think the messages should have an additional warning, something like:\n\n```\nServer down! Bane is unreachable.\nThis server is responsible for the following shards:\n    Table foo for the shard b7663ea1... to +\8734\n    DECLARING THIS SERVER DEAD WILL CAUSE ALL DATA FROM THIS SHARD TO BE COMPLETELY LOST.\n```\n\n```\nAre you sure you want to declare Bane dead?\nTHE DATA FROM ONE OF THE SHARDS OF TABLE FOO WILL BE COMPLETELY LOST.\n```\n\n```\nYou have declared the server to be dead,\nTHE DATA FROM ONE OF THE SHARDS OF TABLE FOO HAS BEEN COMPLETELY LOST.\n```\n"
