      "Hi @frankleng, this isn't supported at the moment. Every member of a RethinkDB cluster has the same permissions.\r\nWe're planning to add read-only connections with a separate auth key https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1805 , but that is for client connections and not cluster connections.\r\nWe don't have any plans to add a permissions system between cluster members.\r\n\r\nOnce we have read-only client connections, you might be able to perform data replication by running a local separated RethinkDB instance and using changefeeds to apply changes to the main cluster to it asynchronously. Would such a solution work for you?"
