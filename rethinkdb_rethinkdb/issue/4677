        "My Setup:\n\n3 Servers, in a Cluster in 3 Datacenters creating a Cluster over fastd/batman-adv (for encryption and mesh-links) and creating one test-table in a test-database with replication:3 and sharding:3.\n\nNow I switched one server off, and looked at the admin-panel, now I got the following informations:\n- Issue 1 - okay, one server is offline\n- Tables 0/1 ready - this looks strange\n\nBelow the detailed report shows:\n\n\"Table test.test is avaible for all operations, but some replicas are not ready.\"\n\nWell sure, but a missing replication of 2, should not result in a \"table not ready\"-information.\n\nIt would be nice, if this information could be changed to a warning-behavoir, means the table-colour should be yellow, not red. And \"table 1/1 ready\" should be displayed, as long as the table is available. Maybe a second line should be added, smaller, something like \"x warnings\".\n\nA screenshot:\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CMOhcgfWsAInCWy.png:large\n\nBest regards\n\nRuben\n"
