      "I think that for the specific use case you're describing, the proper way to support it is to implement triggers (which rethinkdb currently doesn't have).\r\n\r\nOf course supporting find-modify-read is useful in other cases. We discussed it, but it didn't make it into the API. I think it would be easy to support it for point-updates, I'm not sure about range updates. Moving to post-protobuf-improvements, this will likely make it into 1.5."
