      "@nviennot as @coffeemug said I don't think this is possible with the current API and that's the reason for me suggesting the optional arg enhancement that would basically allow `update`/`replace` to return the whole document as part of the result.\r\n\r\nAlso thanks for pointing out the `new` argument in `findAndModify`. Your example makes me think that returning the original version of the document is actually more useful than returning the new version. Even if applying deterministic operations to a doc, these are not necessarily reversible operations so you'd not be able to tell what the original version was (while having the original version and knowing the operation will always allow you to compute the new version)."
