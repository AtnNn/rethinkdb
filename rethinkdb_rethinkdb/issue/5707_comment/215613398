      "> I agree that #2768 is probably a bad idea, but it shows that some users expect map to work on a single selection the same way it does on a stream.\r\n\r\nThat's fair.  On the other hand, I think it's inevitable in any language with overloading that people will sometimes misunderstand what the overloading does.  I might be biased because I use a language where `map` is defined on objects, but it honestly seems like the clearest possible interpretation of `object.map(func)` is mapping over the object, not calling `func(object)`."
