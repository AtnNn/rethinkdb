      "I'm not a huge fan of #878 because the expected behavior described there clashes with the one described in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2768 . So if we ended up overloading `map` for objects it would likely work correctly for ~half of the users, and would work in a really confusing way for the other half who expect `map` on a single selection to work like `do`."
