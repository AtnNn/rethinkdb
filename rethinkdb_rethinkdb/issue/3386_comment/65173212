      "@larkost, I think you're seeing this because `RqlBinary` is just a thin wrapper of `str`.  `help` is actually interpreting the parameter as a typename rather than using the type of the parameter.  I think it should work if you run `help(type(data))`, although that is a little annoying, but the same thing happens with a standard Python `str`."
