      "That appears to be a standard for applying a patch to a single document.  The documents sent by `changes` are instead \"patches\" to a set of documents, i.e. they only say to add or remove a particular document from the set rather than having to specify a path into a sub-field to be changed.  It would be cool to add support for JSON-PATCH when an element of the set has only changed by a small amount, though.  Thanks for the suggestion!"
