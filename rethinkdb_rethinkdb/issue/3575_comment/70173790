      "jsonpatch would make a lot of sense for point changefeeds.\r\n\r\nIf users write apps or use libraries that support jsonpatch, it might be halpful to add `.diff` and `.patch` commands that could be used for things like `.replace(lambda row: row.patch(patch))`.\r\n\r\nHowever I don't get the impression that jsonpatch support and use is very widespread. Please correct me if I am wrong."
