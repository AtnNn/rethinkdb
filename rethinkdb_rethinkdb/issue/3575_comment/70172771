      "@jeregrine : maybe I don't understand what you mean.  Let's say you've run `r.table('test').orderby(index: 'score').limit(10).changes()`, and a new player enters the top 10; what would you expect to see?  (The current format would be `{old_val: player_leaving_top_10, new_val: player_entering_top_10}`.)\r\n\r\nI could imagine us adapting the JSON-PATCH syntax to work for sets rather than single documents, but I'm not sure it would be better than what we have."
