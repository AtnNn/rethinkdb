        "Currently in `reql_admin`, shards are rebalanced whenever the number of shards increases, but not otherwise. We should add a way to rebalance shards. One option would be a `rebalance=True` argument to `reconfigure()`, which forces a rebalance even if the number of shards has decreased or not changed. Another option is an explicit `rebalance()` command."
