      "I think the latency issue might be a good one to add. This came up because a user had a failing disk and from his perspective it just seemed like RethinkDB was slow (he'd been waiting for 2 days for replication to finish). It fooled the rest of us for a while and we probably would have spent a long time debugging it had the user not happened to check dmesg and notice some messages about the errors. I think we should actually prioritize this a bit, maybe not in 1.8 but in 1.9 because it does lead to a really bad experience when this happens and a latency checking issue is not too hard and would catch a lot of cases like this. We shouldn't do fancy stuff because like you said there are better monitoring solutions but for the users not running them (of which I'm pretty sure there are many) having something bare bones could seriously improve the experience for a lot of people."
