      "Ok, here's my plan:\r\n- [ ] remove info boxes\r\n- [ ] Use the SI notation pretty printing function for the cache size\r\n\r\nI'd like to leave the version as is, the full version for debugging purposes is still available by clicking the gear at the top of the web ui\r\n\r\nI don't feel the clock differences are a huge problem. Clock skew is ever-present, and if the client and server are 8 minutes off from each other, I think the web-ui shouldn't paper over it."
