      "Fully agree that we need to round the cache size. If not to GB, at least to full MB. I think this is actually release critical (I guess we didn't catch this because if you specify it manually it will always be exact MB).\r\n\r\nI think we should keep the version as it is on this page. @AtnNn do you want the full version here for making support easier or for other reasons as well? Are there actually cases where the remaining parts of the version matter?\r\n\r\n@deontologician How is the uptime computed? Does it use the `time_started` field in `server_status` and then subtract that from the current time on the client/browser? Maybe we need to use `r.now()` instead to avoid wrong values due to clock differences between the client and the server?\r\n\r\nWe should also look into the info boxes, and maybe just remove them completely."
