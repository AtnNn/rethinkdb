      "Hmm maybe if it's an additional step to get the full version that would be bad because it might cause an additional round-trip with users who are having an issue (\"You have already reported your version, but could you check this specific thing to get us the full version?\").\r\nI'm relatively neutral on the issue. I think in 2.0.x we are showing the full version, so maybe we should just keep that."
