      "Yes, one of the first questions I ask users who are having issues is \"What version are you using?\". If they are running a patched, debug or development version they might mis-report the version.\r\n\r\nUsers might also run into this themselves, for example if they build a patched version of RethinkDB and don't see a version change."
