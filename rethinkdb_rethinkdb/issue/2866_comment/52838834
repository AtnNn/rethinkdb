      "Maybe we should also do it for `includes`, though that is less clear to me. While `intersects` is commutative, `includes` is not.\r\nSo if we want to allow `stream.includes(geometry)`, we should also allow `geometry.includes(stream)`. That's probably fine, but I'm not sure if we are currently doing that anywhere else in ReQL, are we?\r\nThoughts on that?"
