      "I know this is formally in ReQL discussion, but since I'm leaving next weak I went ahead and implemented this in branch daniel_2866. It's in CR 2051 by @gchpaco .\r\n\r\nThe current implementation supports `intersects` and `includes` on streams and arrays, which in that case turn into a filter.\r\nIt does *not* allow `includes` to take a stream as its second argument. Whether we want that or not is still undecided."
