      "@danielmewes I thought about that too. I think it makes sense to allow the drivers to create new connections with an existing `client_id` so it can be shared across the entire pool.\r\n\r\nAllowing drivers to connect with an arbitrary `client_id` might also be an option. That way you could easily filter an application's query logs across all the clients that app spawned. A shared `client_id` might also be used to round-robin changefeeds and things like that."
