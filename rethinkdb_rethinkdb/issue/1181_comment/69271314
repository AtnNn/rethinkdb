      "In `next` now, we enforce UTF-8 on input strings.  When I get some other stuff done, I will be able to fix `split` to be safe, at which point it should not be easy to insert invalid UTF-8 strings into the database.  Not included here is any form of locale support, which is the `toupper`/`tolower` stuff as well as collation; I feel that's grist for a different mill.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes Do you want me to close this now, or wait until we get `split` in?"
