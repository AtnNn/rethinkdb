        "I'd like to filter and map changes to a more simplified structures to reduce network loading and increase efficiency\n\nbut as soon as I chain `.filter()` / `.map()` after `.changes()` my connection starts to timeout(10 second as I specified during creating a connection)\n\nSorry if this is duplicate, but I found only this:\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2485\n\nI also saw this one for the .NET driver so gorethink might have a similar issue\nhttps://github.com/mfenniak/rethinkdb-net/issues/193\nIf this is the case, sorry for disturbing\n\nThanks!\n"
