      "So, I'm not necessarily opposed to this, but it isn't quite as easy as just flipping a flag somewhere.\r\n\r\nWe currently support e.g. `seq.slice(1, -1)` to skip the first element of a sequence (analogous to `seq[1..-1]` in Ruby).    If we switch to half-open intervals, we need to provide some other way to slice all the way to the end of a sequence.\r\n\r\nThis requires a change to the type signature of the protobuf, for starters.  It also precludes Range syntax in Ruby (we'd probably use `nil` to mean \"slice to end of sequence\", and `1..nil` is a type error in Ruby).\r\n\r\nOne workaround for this would be to have two functions, `slice` and `closed_slice` (`a...b` and `a..b` respectively in Ruby)."
