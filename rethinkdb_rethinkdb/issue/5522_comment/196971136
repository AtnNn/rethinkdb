      "There are some restrictions with the current model, that would need some work to change. Specifically, we must currently select a replica as primary during failover that's at least as up-to-date as the most up-to-date replica in any quorum of replicas (in practice we simply pick the most up-to-date one). Violating this would cause already acknowledged writes to be rolled back.\r\n\r\nWe could pick the most up-to-date replica at first, and then later transition to the replica with the highest priority (/ lowest weight) however once it has caught up. This is probably not hard to do."
