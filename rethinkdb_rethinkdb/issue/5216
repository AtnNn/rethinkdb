        "This is easiest to run into with very small batch sizes and lots of duplicate sindex values.  The file `init_trivial_fuzz.rb` that will be merged into `next` and `2.2.x` shortly can also be used to reproduce this if you compare the `$state` document at the end to the actual state of documents in the table.\n\nI suspect this is caused by `truncate_and_get_left` being too liberal in its calculation of the currently-read range.\n\n@danielmewes -- I'll try to get this done over the holidays, but as far as I can tell this isn't a new bug so it shouldn't hold up the release of 2.2.\n"
