      "Replying to my question: I see that rethinkdb debian package depends ncurses package that contains termcap shared library. It seems the debian package has some form of backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe arch package does not have such compatibility - it includes only libncurses.so https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/i686/ncurses/\r\n\r\nBut the question: why tercap API was chosen in favor of ncurses still remains."
