      "If we were to use the ncurses API, it would require much deeper changes to the code.  Refactoring the admin CLI is something I would like to get to eventually, but termcap allowed me to make the changes while affecting the least lines of code.  At the moment, I've only used bold and underline, nothing fancy, so it really wasn't necessary to have a more complicated API."
