        "I looked for previous issues about this but couldn't see anything. Sorry if it's a duplicate. The current QL2.proto file doesn't specify a package.\n\nThis is generally good to have to avoid naming collisions with other protocol buffers in general usage in all languages. It's also essential for Java, as all Classes need to have a (Java) package to be used. See https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#packages for more details.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about adding this? I'm not 100% sure what the downstream effect of this would be. \n\nRelates to apa512/rethinkdb-protobuf#1\n"
