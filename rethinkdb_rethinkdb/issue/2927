        "After installing the binary distribution of v1.13.3 on Fedora 17, the permissions on some of the resources for the admin interface in /usr/share/rethinkdb/web/ were not set right.  So if running rethinkdb as a non-root user, trying to use the admin interface caused errors like:\r\n\r\nFile /usr/share/rethinkdb/web/js/jquery.validate.min.js was requested and is on the whitelist but we didn't find it in the directory.\r\n\r\nFixed by making all those files readable by all."
