      "I think before `reduce` was using the optional base to reduce a sequence of one element.\r\n\r\nSo one way to get the previous behavior is to do something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.expr([base]).union(sequence).reduce(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n@mlucy should know more about the current/previous behavior though."
