      "@neumino is right here -- `reduce` isn't meant to run on a single value. The proper way to do this is to `map` to the value, and if there is only one, the result of the map would be returned.\r\n\r\nI know it's annoying to migrate some of the older code, but this behavior is *much* more parallelization friendly, and once everyone has migrated this is a much better situation for us to be in."
