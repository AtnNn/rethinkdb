      "@Rajan I've opened an issue for offline support in the other repository, and will open a second one for better Android/iOS integration.\r\n\r\nThe Fusion protocol is designed to allow for fairly straight-forward integration into a wide number of frameworks. I think this is something we will look into fairly soon after we've got the JavaScript API fully working.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue in favor of the other ones.\r\n(the other repository isn't public yet, but will be fairly soon once we have something to release)"
