      "Thanks @coffeemug \r\nThere's a project along the lines of realtime-web-apps with Rethink: http://deepstream.io/\r\nhttp://telepat.io/ is doing a fair job of mobile-sdks using couchbase and other things but too many tools.\r\nIdeally, I'd like to see the Fusion developed as \"mobile first\" framework rather than web-first which seems to be the case. Being great mobile first platform means:\r\n\r\n* Offline-first and real-time sync Swift/Java sdks for iOS/Android\r\n* Out of the box watching of \"changefeeds\" from those libraries.\r\n* Passportjs supported user creation and authentication\r\n\r\nSome iOS/Swift work is done here, may be we can reuse/rewrite:\r\nhttps://github.com/dorjeozer/LoopBack-Swift\r\nhttps://github.com/pixelspark/rethink-swift\r\nLater, we can have the same functionality with Android sdk.\r\n"
