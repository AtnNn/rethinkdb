        "Running `RethinkDB 2.1.1` on 3 servers _(each with 2 cores and 13GB of memory)_. The table `daily_quotes` has 3 shards and 3 replicas. Each shard has around 22,000 documents. There is a secondary index on `date`.\n\nRunning a simple query:\n\n```\nr.db('macd').table('daily_quotes').orderBy('date')\n```\n\nTakes over 23 seconds. I ran a query profile and see:\n\n```\n23.32s round-trip time\n10.87s server time\n312 shard accesses\n```\n\nAnd here is the raw query profile json:\n\n**REMOVED JSON BECAUSE IT WAS HUGE**\n"
