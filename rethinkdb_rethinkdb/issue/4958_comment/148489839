      "@danielmewes oh interesting, am I allowed to modify the table config like that? I hadn't considered that.. \r\n\r\nAside from that I completely understand that this would be difficult to implement (as far as I've looked at the code as well), and probably has correctness implications I haven't even begun to consider. Our current approach seems to work fine for the moment (aside from perhaps being the culprit in #4931), but I'm glad we can leave it up to see if anyone else wants the functionality."
