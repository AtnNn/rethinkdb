      "We are currently looking for something along these lines also.\r\n\r\nFor example we have two tags configured with 8 servers and tables set to 3 replicas, and if a server containing a replica drops manual intervention is required.  It would be much better from our perspective if RethinkDB would immediately start a backfill to replace the missing replica on an available server within the tag.\r\n\r\n"
