        "Currently we scan for instances of `r.row` on the client in places where we expect a function (e.x. `.map`). We then wrap the argument with a function before serializing it for consumption by the server.\r\n\r\nThis transformation has nothing to do with mapping the argument of the function to the implicit variable (`r.row`). It only serves to make it easier for the server to handle the argument where it expects a func term.\r\n\r\nThis processing is simple enough but makes it significantly harder to support the implicit variable in 3rd party drivers than other, \"regular\" commands.\r\n\r\nWe should move this processing into the server and reduce the complexity of the drivers. The driver should be able to serialize the term it's given (possibly containing an instance of `r.row` and let the server determine if this is an implicitly defined function. Note that this would be trivially backwards compatible with drivers that continued to do the transformation client side."
