        "Noticed by @neumino in https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/744 : \n\n``` js\nr.time(1986, 11, 3, \"+00:00\").date()\nMon Nov 03 1986 00:00:00 GMT+00:00\n\nr.time(1986, 11, 3, \"+02:00\").date()\nMon Nov 03 1986 02:00:00 GMT+02:00\n```\n\nI feel like this might be a bug, since it behaves _really_ badly in some cases:\n\n``` js\nr.time(1986, 11, 3, 23, 0, 0, \"-02:00\").inTimezone(\"+00:00\")\nTue Nov 04 1986 01:00:00 GMT+00:00\n// So this time is on the 4th in UTC, and on the 3rd in -02:00. But let's see what date makes of it:\n\nr.time(1986, 11, 3, 23, 0, 0, \"-02:00\").date()\nSun Nov 02 1986 22:00:00 GMT-02:00\n// It's saying that this is on the 2nd! This doesn't seem to make any sense to me.\n```\n\n`timeOfDate` has a similar problem, and I think this is almost certainly a bug:\n\n``` js\nr.time(1986, 11, 3, \"+02:00\").timeOfDay()\n-7200\n```\n\nNote that it returns a negative number.\n\nmentioning (@neumino , @mlucy)\n"
