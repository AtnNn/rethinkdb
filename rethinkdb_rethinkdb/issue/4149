But let's see what date makes of it:\r\n\r\nr.time(1986, 11, 3, 23, 0, 0, \"-02:00\").date()\r\nSun Nov 02 1986 22:00:00 GMT-02:00\r\n// It's saying that this is on the 2nd! This doesn't seem to make any sense to me.\r\n```\r\n\r\n`timeOfDate` has a similar problem, and I think this is almost certainly a bug:\r\n```js\r\nr.time(1986, 11, 3, \"+02:00\").timeOfDay()\r\n-7200\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it returns a negative number.\r\n\r\nmentioning (@neumino , @mlucy)"
