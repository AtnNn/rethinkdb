      "@herby, understood. We had a user report the following regarding protobuf on CentOS 6.4 (recording here to help other CentOS users):\r\n\r\nNote - this build was using the precompiled tarballs available at http://download.rethinkdb.com/dist/.\r\n\r\n> Installing Protobuf: [protobuf] didn't show up via yum, so I used the following method:\r\n> ```\r\n> wget http://protobuf.googlecode.com/files/protobuf-2.4.1.tar.bz2\r\n> tar xfj protobuf-2.4.1.tar.bz2\r\n> cd protobuf-2.4.1\r\n> ./configure\r\n> make\r\n>make install\r\n> ```\r\n> re-ran config by itself to make sure that protobuf was getting picked up.  config failed overall, but protobuf did get > picked up.\r\n\r\nAfter running `scripts/build-rpm.sh` there were still some issues, (that @atnnn is planning on fixing), but the build succeeded (created binary in `build/packages/rpm/usr/bin/rethinkdb`).\r\n\r\nThis process (and the protobuf issue) has several issues, but successful builds should be currently possible on 6.4. Completely agreed that it's not easy, and we'll work hard to make it easier."
