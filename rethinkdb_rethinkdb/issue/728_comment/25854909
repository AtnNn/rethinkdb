      "So we somehow have the following situation (in chronological order):\r\n\r\nWrite transaction t1 acquires its first block (I assume the superblock). This initializes its version id.\r\n(t1 releases the superblock)\r\nWrite transaction t2 acquires its first block (I assume the superblock). This initializes its version id.\r\nt2 gets a lock on a certain block b\r\n(t2 releases b)\r\nt1 gets a lock on the same block b\r\n\r\nThe snapshotting it turns out was designed under the assumption that a write transaction can never bypass another one. This seems to be violated somewhere, which might be a bug, or maybe it is by design?"
