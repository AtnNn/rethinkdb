      "I can confirm that this is a block that we do acquire out of order which is by design.\r\n\r\nI don't think either of your solutions will work for the reasons you give. How hard would it be to relax the constraint? Another option would be to use the same synchronization method for the stat block as we do for the secondary index block. One thing I'm not sure of is how we handle the stat block when we do an erase_range. It's been a while since I touched this code. That could be kind of hard to do using sindex_tokens for synchronization."
