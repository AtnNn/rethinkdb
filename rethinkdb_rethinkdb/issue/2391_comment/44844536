      "@Tryneus I have another question, the function `on_ring()` cannot block, that means we cannot try to acquire a worker from the semaphore in `extproc_pool_t` in order to deallocate/kill it. Am I right ? How can we solve this ?\r\n\r\nI was thinking about deallocating a worker when a job releases it (since it's already been acquired from the semaphore)"
