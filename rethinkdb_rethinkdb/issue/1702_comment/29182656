      "It would also be useful to know the information @coffeemug mentioned for each server.  That is, the `/ajax` output from the web UI of server 1, then 2, then 3.  Out of curiosity, I'd also like to see the startup parameters you are using with each server, although I'm not sure that will get us anywhere.\r\n\r\nAre all the `rethinkdb` instances running on separate machines, and do these machines have full connectivity between them?  In case any of the servers are connecting through a proxy, keep in mind that there are some extra steps needed for configuration."
