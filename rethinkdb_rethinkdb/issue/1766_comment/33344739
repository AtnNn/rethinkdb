      "There still seems to be something especially slow about `limit`.\r\n`r.table('foo').map(function (x) {return x;}).count()` takes 12ms server time.\r\n`r.table('foo').limit(200).map(function (x) {return x;}).count()` takes 73ms.\r\n\r\nThere are only 200 documents in the table. So I don't think it's an issue with batching, is it?\r\n\r\nAlso, this issue is partially related to #1886."
