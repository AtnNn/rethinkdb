      "I feel like we might be dealing with a bunch of loosely related problems here:\r\n\r\n* That 40ms feels like a really long time to do `r.table('foo').limit(100).coerce_to(\"array\").do(1)` (it may not be, but then again, we may be doing something dumb).\r\n* That 230ms is way longer than 40ms and that feels off (it may not be, but then again, we may be doing something dumb).\r\n* The array-related issued in my original comment (which may or may not be an issue).\r\n\r\nAlso, if anyone has the time, I'd like to see MySQL performance for an equivalent workload."
