      "@wildattire -- thanks for additional information. Here is what I'd like to do:\r\n\r\n* We'll take a quick look at what's going on in the near future to see if there is something dumb/simple we can fix.\r\n* We haven't done much optimization for range queries yet, and there may not be an easy solution until we do full scientific benchmarks. This will take some time, but it will happen soon. I'll get this scheduled once stability/devops work has been done.\r\n\r\nLeaving it in 1.11.x for now, we'll do quick tests and then decide where to go from there.\r\n\r\n"
