      "Not sure if this helps, but the performance degradation seems to be proportional to rows returned, not necessarily rows in the table. Queries that only return a document or two, whether via secondary index or even value scan on a large table seem to execute very quickly, but not so for the return of, say, 100 rows, even if *locating* the rows is very quick.\r\n\r\nThis is also the case in the profiler output timing, so this behavior is independent of driver overhead.\r\n\r\nAlso, as noted before, the performance hit is associated with very high cpu load, NOT i/o wait.\r\n"
