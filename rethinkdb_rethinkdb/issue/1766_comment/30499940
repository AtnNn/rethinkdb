      "Also note, if, instead of inserting an array of 400 elements I instead use the word 'hello' for each document, the latency drops to 8ms. If I use a string of 400 characters, I get a latency of 10ms. So the order of magnitude latency increase seems to come from arrays specifically. I'm not sure if it comes from the server or the client."
