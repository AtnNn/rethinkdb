      "Allow me to point out that my complaint is entirely driver and client independent.  The times reported by the profiler alone are cause for concern.  See @coffeemug's gist set up at https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/7942219 and some of my napkin math pointing out that rethink appears to be executing on the order of 1000 cpu instructions just to move a single byte of data.\r\n\r\nThis is driver-independent. The issue has to do with the sheer speed of data transit - not to the client library across the network, but internal to RDB itself.  get() executes quickly enough, as does getAll() if the secondary index doesn't select on a lot of rows.  But if you have a query that happens to return a fair number of rows, rethinkdb is burning a LOT of cpu time just moving data - and previously mentioned, about 1000 instructions per byte.\r\n"
