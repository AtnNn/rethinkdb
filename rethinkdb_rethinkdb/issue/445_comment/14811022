      "oooh, that does appear to be a juicy server bug. I guess I've generally only become familiar with the tests that have failed at one point or another. Most of those have been mismatches in error message texts.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner The tests in question, the tests in test/rql_test/, are designed to unit test the API as presented in the drivers. There is no sharding, no replication, and no tables larger than about 100 rows. I believe that we have long had other tests that exercise actual database functionality using the defunct memcached interface (and maybe using the pre-1.4 version of RQL) but as far as I know, there are no 1.4 RQL tests that go that deep."
