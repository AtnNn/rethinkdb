      "For parity. If someone comes from JS where they're used to having `toString` and they don't have an equivalent they'll have to figure out that they can use `__str__` that's not a big deal but we might as well save them that trouble. And having the same functions in the different drivers (modulo the different naming conventions) is just a nice policy."
