      "1. For `use_outdated` I only want to test the API/spec in the context of this issue (ie. that the server accepts it). The actual semantic/functionality test is outside the scope of the test framework for the time being.\r\n2. For `toString` we should use the language's standard facilities. If in python people are used to `__str__`, we should just do that. (I'd be cool with `to_string` in python for parity, though I don't think it's necessary)."
