      "@coffeemug The option reading from replicas is expressed in the .proto file and in the drivers as `use_outdated`, not `run_outdated`. If the server uses the other name then we'll have to resolve the conflict by either changing the server or by fixing the drivers and documentation.\r\n\r\nHow exactly do you propose testing the option? Presumably you'd like simply to ensure that the option is accepted by the server without error? Actually testing if the option does the correct thing by teasing out the differences in performance on highly sharded tables will require a more comprehensive testing system."
