      "That would need some server-side support though to distinguish between simple index functions (i.e. `function (x) { return x('foo'); }`) and more complex ones.\r\nI think in the long term we will support printing out a pretty-printed version of the index function, but that's a separate issue.\r\n\r\nI think distinguishing geo and possibly multi indexes would be a good start."
