      "So the new behavior would be that if a `default` branch isn't specified, the compiler still produces an error if you skip an `enum` value, but if a `default` branch is specified then it doesn't?\r\n\r\nThe only thing that makes me a tiny bit hesitant about this is that our current rule (where you put `default: unreachable()` at the end) fails quickly when you read from invalid memory rather than silently falling through.  (We end up reading enum values from freed or corrupted memory an embarassing amount, actually.)  But I suppose that's probably fine."
