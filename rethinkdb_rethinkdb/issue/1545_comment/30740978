      "Ok, after discussing this internally I'd like to close this pull request for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* The implementation here isn't ideal (it checks only for metadata, not for all files)\r\n* There is no strong consensus/interest on switching to a different implementation\r\n* There is an easy workaround\r\n\r\nIf someone still feels strongly about this, please open a separate github issue and I'll try to get it scheduled.\r\n\r\n@cxmcc -- I'm sorry this took so long to resolve. I'll try to be more prompt in deciding on pull requests, somehow this one slipped through the cracks."
