      "I can see why the compiler is confused here.  This code is only correct because we know that if we have no substreams then `v` is empty.  We have a sanity check that `is_sindex_sort` is actually filled in, but I guess the compiler isn't smart enough to realize that we'll abort if that check fails?"
