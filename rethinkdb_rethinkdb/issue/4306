It might make sense to stagger the initial stack pointers of coroutines so that they're more spread out among the stacks' first page.\n\nThe same might be true of buffer cache blocks -- it might help to make sure that 4K blocks allocated to a 512-byte alignment aren't all actually allocated to 4K alignment.\n"
