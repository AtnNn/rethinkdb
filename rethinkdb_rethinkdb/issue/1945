(Unknown error -512) (offset = 147186683904, count = 356352)\nerror: Backtrace:\nerror: Wed Feb 12 02:49:02 2014\n[...]\n```\n\nThis error message doesn't tell the user at all what's going on. The \"Unknown error -512\" is especially bad. We should probably have a custom error message for running out of disk space, and not just crash through `guarantee()`.\n"
