      "@danielmewes Fortunately, I got replicas in other two instances, so probably no data loss. I replaced the crash instance with a new one and rebalanced.\r\n\r\n\"Have you recently created any new secondary indexes on this cluster?\"\r\n--> No, this cluster has been running for a long time, no changes has been made recently. One thing I concern that this cluster contains very big data size (220 GB, 3 shards, 3 replicas for every tables) while the cache size assigned for total cluster is quite small, 2GB/instance)\r\n\r\n\"Does it crash immediately after you restart it?\"\r\n--> Yes, a few seconds after \"Server ready\" status"
