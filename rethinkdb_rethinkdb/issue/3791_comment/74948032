      "Cool, would be great if you could verify. Also, could you paste the following:\r\n\r\n- the first part of the log (I'd like to know which version of RethinkDB you're running)\r\n- the output of `rethinkdb help`\r\n\r\nWe used to take advantage of DirectIO by default, but in newer versions we turned that off. Once I know the version you're running, I might be able to suggest a flag that might fix this.\r\n\r\nOnce we go through these steps, we'll formulate a more general solution to this problem and see if we can fix it in the product for everyone."
