      "> also ran into this #3837 but in a boot2docker environment.\r\n\r\nUhm, ok, just to make sure:\r\ni am having the problem inside the boot2docker on a mac (which uses Virtualbox) too.\r\n\r\nThe shared folder is the only way to use data from my mac inside any container, which also leads to persistence of a data volume when the container is removed.\r\n\r\n> You can use orderBy with a function to get the same functionality\r\n> r.table(...).orderBy(function (x) { return [x('field1'), x('field2'), ...]; })\r\n\r\nI have the python driver. Does the lambda function fit the case?"
