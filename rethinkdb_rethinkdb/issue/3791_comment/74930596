      "Ah, I see. It looks like this doesn't have anything to do with secondary indexes (this just happens to be the operation that triggers the error).\r\n\r\nRethinkDB has an on-disk gabrage collector/compactor that incrementally removes old blocks from the file and truncates it. In some file system setups (e.g. virtualbox shared folders) these operations aren't supported, and the RethinkDB server exits with an error you got in the log file.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to set up the data directory differently where it isn't in a shared VirtualBox folder?"
