      "I can verify this by running a test tomorrow on a linux host with docker, so i can bypass the virtualbox.\r\nThe problem is that I don't see how i could have data persistence if don't use the shared folder on boot2docker inside a docker container.\r\n\r\nMy suggestions:\r\n- try to find a better way to show what the real problem is to a user in my same situation\r\n- give an option to save indexes or other similar operations (unsupported on a shared virtualbox folder) into a separate directory. In such a way i could rebuild my indexes at each restart keeping persistence on tables data.\r\n\r\nThanks for your effort, and for your great work, by the way. I really love RethinkDB ;)"
