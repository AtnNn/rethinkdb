      "I think we should just never unlink the file while we're still using it. Instead we should only unlink it when the disk-backed queue is destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe only case where it makes a difference as far as I can tell is if the server crashes or is killed during a sindex construction or backfill. In that case the temporary file remains on disk until the server is restarted the next time. This doesn't seem like a huge problem to me."
