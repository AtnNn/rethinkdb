      "@alimoeeny The CR number is for our internal code review tool. You can find the fix in branch daniel_3791.\r\n\r\nHowever it is branched off from our development branch, so I wouldn't recommend using it for important data.\r\n\r\nYou could manually apply this patch https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/commit/5e90224bf0485c40a8aa5f5812886f189e81f54f into the branch v1.16.x and then compile from there. Does that work for you?\r\n\r\nThe patch is officially going to ship with RethinkDB 2.0, which we hope to release about two weeks from now.\r\n\r\nLet me know if one of those options works for you. If you need this urgently I could compile a special binary based on v1.16.x for you (which guest operating system are you using?)."
