      "yeah I was seeing how many connections it could handle, something like open 1000 connections and try to do 1000 inserts on each of them, pretty much as quickly as possible\r\n\r\nit seems osx doesn't like me overloading I/O and it decided to just crash system wide and every process gets disconnected from I/O operations and you have to hard power off\r\n\r\nI reproduced the same thing two more times before it got annoying having to reboot "
