      "#4585 brings down the export time a little bit if the data is on SSDs. From 4h 20 min to 3h 53 min for the table with the large documents.\r\n\r\nThis was with a RethinkDB 2.1 server, which is probably a bit faster than 2.0 in handling the large documents on the server side.\r\nI think if the data is on hard disks, things will still be quite a bit slower because of disk seeks.\r\n\r\n@kikohs had you given the idea of storing a JSON string for some of the documents a thought?"
