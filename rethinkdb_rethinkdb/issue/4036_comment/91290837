      "Hi @kikohs, thank you for reporting this behavior. We'll try to reproduce this and investigate why it's happening. It's definitely not expected.\r\n\r\nA few questions:\r\n- Are the 250 values in your data numbers or other types? If other types: how large are they approximately?\r\n- Is your data stored on an SSD or rotational drive?\r\n- What is the RethinkDB cache size? You can find it in a log message on the web UI's \"Logs\" tab.\r\n- Could you check whether RethinkDB is doing i/o and/or exhausting the CPU while running the query? (e.g. through `htop` and `iostat -d 1 -m`)\r\n- If you have swap enabled on your system, can you check that it's not being used / that enough free memory is available while the query is running? How much RAM does your server have?"
