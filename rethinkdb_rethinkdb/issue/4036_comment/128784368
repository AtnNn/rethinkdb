      "@kikohs yes, the Python driver serializes the data as JSON, but the data isn't stored as JSON on disk. It's converted into a different format that makes it more efficient to access individual fields on the server. The downside for very large documents is though that it has to be converted back to JSON whenever the document is read, which incurs additional overhead."
