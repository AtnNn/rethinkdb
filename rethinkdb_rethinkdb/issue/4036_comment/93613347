      "@kikohs While the original `stats` table output suggests that it might not have been the only problem, we did find an issue with the cache balancer that could easily explain the incredibly slow `export` you've seen.\r\n\r\nWe have a fix which we are currently testing and will release a 2.0.1 point release as soon as it's ready.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience."
