      "@danielmewes  I tried to export my database to give it to you but it failed saying that the drive is full. The database weights 101GB and my drive has 310 GB of free space ... The export takes 3 times the size of the database ?\r\nI have just updated RethinkDb to the latest version, it still stalls at 83%. If I ever manage to export it, I will give it to you.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2015-04-21 at 10 47 57](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1793640/7248614/53665392-e814-11e4-8fa7-35fc025ab2d7.png)\r\n"
