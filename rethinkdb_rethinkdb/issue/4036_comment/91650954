      "I actually don't think the io threads are the problem here. In fact more i/o threads will give the operating system and the drive more opportunity to re-order operations, making it more efficient.\r\n\r\nThe low read rate on the disk of about 0.7 MB/s that you reported @kikohs is not unreasonable. It's doing 168 i/o transactions per second. If all of them are random reads of about 4 KB (which is likely with RethinkDB), that's a very reasonable read rate for a rotational drive.\r\nHowever I'm baffled by the fact that it seems to be doing multiple disk reads for every read. I find it especially weird that the newly created test table is immediately slow. I would expect that table to fully fit into cache with ease.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be surprised if we had a bug in our cache balancer, the piece of code that distributes the available cache size across all tables. If it for some reason sets it to 0 for a table, that might explain this terrible performance. I'll investigate.\r\n\r\n"
