      "@danielmewes My file system for the rotational drive is Ext3.\r\nI will do the experiments on monday. I have launched a batch job on a new instance of rethinkdb on an SSD (ext4) (takes 2-3 days). It is exactly the same data. The reason I was using the disk in the first place is  storage since it is quite expensive to buy 1 To SSDs.\r\nAfter it is done, we can compare the read speed for both and see if it stalls again even on SSD."
