      "Never mind the cache balancer hypothesis. Looking at the earlier `r.db('rethinkdb').table('stats')` dump, I can see that the table in question actually uses 326 MB of cache which is perfectly reasonable.\r\n\r\nIt might have been reduced to close to 0 at some point before because other tables might have been more active at that point. However even then I wouldn't expect less than about 100 reads/s, so this is still very weird.\r\n\r\n@kikohs You mentioned that you have 16 GB of RAM on the server, and RethinkDB picked 7336 MB for its cache. You can probably bump that cache size up quite a bit more without running out of memory. This is worth a try, so at least you can export your data efficiently. I recommend starting RethinkDB with `--cache-size 12000` for example."
