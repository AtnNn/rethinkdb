      "@kikohs thank you for the update.\r\nThat's rather concerning, I would have expected an SSD to make the problem be much less prominent at least.\r\nDid you build 2.0.1 from `v2.0.x`?\r\n\r\nCould you also re-run `r.db('rethinkdb').table('stats')` while the slow export is running and post the output here?\r\n\r\nI think it would be best if we could reproduce this locally. Is there a chance you could send us a tar file with your data files? We can arrange a secure upload site for the transfer.\r\nWe're also happy to sign an NDA if you have sensitive data in your database."
