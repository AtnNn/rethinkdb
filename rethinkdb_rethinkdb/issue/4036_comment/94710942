      "> The export takes 3 times the size of the database ?\r\n\r\n@kikohs -- the export tool uses plain text json while the data file itself is binary. So the export file can easily be much larger than the database file itself.\r\n\r\nOne easy way to share the database is to shut down the server, zip the `rethinkdb_data` directory, and then send it to us. Would you be able to do it this way?"
