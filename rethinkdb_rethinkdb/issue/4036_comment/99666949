      "@kikohs Here's a question: How much processing of the documents are you doing in ReQL?\r\nI suspect that if you serialized the data into a JSON string and then stored it as a single string things would become a lot faster.\r\nThough you'd lose the option of accessing or modifying individual parts of them in ReQL without going through a `.json` / `.to_json_string` loop first (which could again be slow)."
