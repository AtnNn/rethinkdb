      "Thanks @kikohs for the info.\r\nI doubt it's the RAM. My guess would be that it's either really slow reading the values from disk, or we're doing something very stupid in the server. We'll try to reproduce it and see what we find.\r\n\r\nFor finding out whether it's doing i/o, you can also run this query in the Data Explorer while the slow read is running:\r\n```js\r\nr.db('rethinkdb').table('stats').hasFields('storage_engine')\r\n```\r\nIt will give you one document per table, each with a `disk` object in it that has a `read_bytes_per_sec` field."
