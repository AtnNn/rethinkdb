      "This is a limitation of how queries are currently terminated.\r\nQueries only get terminated when they generate the next (batch of) results. In this case that appears to take a very long time, since presumably the `filter` criteria matches very rarely?\r\n\r\nWe should explain this limitation better in the documentation. I'm going to open a separate issue for that.\r\n\r\nWould you mind elaborating a bit on what you mean by \"it effectively locks up the whole db\"? Do other queries become (too) slow while this is running?"
