      "Thanks for checking, that memory consumption looks fine.\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure why the `filter` query would make other queries that much slower on an SSD (a bit of slowdown is normal of course). What are the other queries you're running like? Can you also check how much CPU the server is using (via top or htop), and how much i/o is happening (e.g. `iostat -d 2 -m`)?\r\n\r\nI opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/979 btw. to document the limitations of killing a query better.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, I believe changing your query to use `get` should avoid this issue in the future (it should return really quickly with that)."
