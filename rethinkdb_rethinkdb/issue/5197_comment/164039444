      "> The whole database becomes unresponsive\r\n\r\nThat probably shouldn't happen. Can you check `free -m` to make sure that there's enough memory available and the server isn't going into swap?\r\n\r\nI suspect it could become so slow because of i/o contention. Is the database stored on a rotational disk (rather than an SSD)?\r\n\r\nCurrently the only way of killing this query is restarting RethinkDB on the server."
