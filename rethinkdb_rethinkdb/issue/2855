        "The proposal for geospatial indexes https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2571 included an interface for compound geo indexes. However the proposal only permitted the geospatial component to be at the beginning of the index, which doesn't yield efficient performance in many use cases given the way that geospatial indexes are currently implemented.\n\nThe code currently in `next` does not permit compound geo indexes at all.\n\nI'll add more details soon, as to where the problems lie and what our options are.\n"
