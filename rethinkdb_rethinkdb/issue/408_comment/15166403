      "That makes a lot of sense, sorry (reopening). I sometimes forget that shuffling issues around in github affects people other than the dev team (whom I can just talk to since we're in the same room). GitHub *really* blurs the line between internal and external dev processes (which is a great thing, IMO, but I find myself still getting used to it and blundering from time to time). Reopening, will let @neumino  close when it makes sense.\r\n\r\nAs for the Ruby bug, do you mean #473? (I'll comment on it in a second, but if you mean a different one, please let me know)."
