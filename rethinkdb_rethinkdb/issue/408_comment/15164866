      "Well, it's strange to close an issue while it's still an issue. For example I was using the existence of this issue in Open state as a signal it is still not safe to use 1.6. Put there a label \"not our bug\" and keep it open.\r\nThe same for closed Ruby bug without actually linking to merged pullrequest/commit that actually fixed it.\r\nBut it's only my view; after all it's your process."
