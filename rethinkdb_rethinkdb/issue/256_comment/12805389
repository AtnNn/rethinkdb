      "I think we should keep `q.run()` and therefore if we have to drop one syntax, it would be `conn.run(q)` and not `q.run(conn)`.\r\nI also agree with @mlucy comments.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure we really have to change things here.\r\nThe problem from my point of view is that we have __nothing__ that explains how to use RethinkDB for a real website.\r\nPeople don't like to read docs, they prefer to read tutorial/cookbook/etc because it's less complicated and let your feel better what the product is."
