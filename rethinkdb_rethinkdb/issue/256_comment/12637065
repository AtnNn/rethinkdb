      "I think `q.run(conn)` is much better than `conn.run(q)`, for three reasons:\r\n* The query reads more naturally.\r\n* It doesn't mess up the indentation on multi-line queries.\r\n* It's more similar to the convenient global form.\r\n\r\nCompare:\r\n```\r\nr.table('test').get(0).run($c)\r\n$c.run(r.table('test').get(0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother option, at least in Ruby, is to detect whether we're running in IRB and print a big ugly warning if people run a query on the last connection when not in interactive mode or debug mode."
