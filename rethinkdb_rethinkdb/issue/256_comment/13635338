      "This would be especially useful for JS where repl use is already extremely complicated. In Python I haven't had any problems using the repl.\r\n\r\nI think I'll add a `replConnect` in addition to `connect` that doesn't take a callback and sets a global object (as well as printing errors rather than throwing them). When in `replConnect` mode you will not have to pass a connection or callback to `run` on a query and it will simply print the result when it arrives."
