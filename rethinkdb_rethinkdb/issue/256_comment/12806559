      ":+1: to docs with repeated information -- my favorite example of this is [Redis's command reference](http://redis.io/commands).\r\n\r\nThe Node convention, inasmuch as there is one, is more along the lines of conn.run(q) than q.run(conn), and I do prefer the former (mostly out of habituation), but I think the overall goal of simplification is more important, and so either one is an improvement."
