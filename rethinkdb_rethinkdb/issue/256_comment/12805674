      "I prefer to read docs / manuals. Not tutorial/cookbook/etc as those are mostly likely out of date and incomplete.\r\n\r\nI really like docs / manuals with good embedded examples for each thing. Especially when there's lots of duplication between examples so that when I look at a specific function I get the whole picture even if that picture is duplicated across a lot of functions."
