      "In a perfect world, we should fix the ruby driver instead of using a weird protobuf term.\r\nWe should whitelist the commands the ruby drivers creates, and be able to special case a few commands.\r\nBut that's probably (definitively) more work, so let's keep it the way it is.\r\n\r\nCould we also use `toJSON` in JavaScript instead of `toJson` as `toJSON` is a standard method on many objects (like Dates -- http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_tojson.asp)"
