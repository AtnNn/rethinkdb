      "Nope.  Grr.  So the problem basically is that ql2.pb.rb defines a constant TO_JSON, and in func.rb this is translated to a `to_json` method on RQL objects, which conflicts with the global `to_json` method installed by `require 'json'`.  Now as it happens we can use `JSON.generate` to work around this, but that requires catching all the places."
