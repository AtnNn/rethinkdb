      "Reviewing the backtraces I have, the problem essentially ends up being that when you call `JSON.generate` on an arbitrary Ruby object, it recurses down its contents; if it finds an object that defines a `to_json` method (as we do) it will call it.  Thus the problem boils down to we need to find another name for `to_json`."
