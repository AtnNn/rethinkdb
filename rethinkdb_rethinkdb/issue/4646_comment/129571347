      "OK, I did this the easy way and it's not quite as simple as I'd expected. In order to unify the error specification in the polyglot tests, we'd also have to change how many arguments are reported by the error message. Right now there are numerous that say \"expected 0 but found 1\", whereas the other drivers say \"expected 1 but found 2\". I think that's a large enough change not to try to slip it in at the last moment, so I'm not doing this for now."
