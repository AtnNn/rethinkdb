        "@jdoliner pointed out that we don't actually clear blobs when they're unused. Since a big part of 1.8 is disk space improvements and this is really easy to fix, it seems prudent to do this.\n\n@atnnn @jdoliner -- is it possible to get this in for 1.8? (I'm not sure how far along we are with tagging and such).\n"
