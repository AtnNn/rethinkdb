      "Moving to post-protobuf-improvements.\r\n\r\nAlso, to clarify, with the proposed scheme, `keys` on a table could be defined as follows: `table('foo').map(r.row.map(r.row('key'))).distinct()`\r\n\r\nEDIT: actually the definition above is wrong because the data passed to distinct would include a stream of arrays (assuming `map` on an object returns an array, which seems to make sense). So to do this I think we'd need a `concatMap` here instead of `map`, like so: `table('foo').concatMap(r.row.map(r.row('key')).arrayToStream()).distinct()`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
