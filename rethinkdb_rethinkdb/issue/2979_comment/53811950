      "> What if we just made the current server be the first returned object in server_status?\r\n\r\nThat seems fragile.\r\n\r\nI think that the most elegant ideal long-term solution is to make it a method or field on the ReQL connection object. If we don't want to go to the trouble of implementing that for this release, I think that `/ajax/me` would make a good stop-gap measure."
