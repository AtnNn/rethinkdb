      "* I would call it `conn.server_uuid()` to make it clear it returns a UUID. We might eventually implement something called `conn.server()` which returns a name.\r\n\r\n* If we're connected to a proxy, it won't have a machine ID (I think). I guess we could return the string `\"proxy\"`.\r\n \r\n* Will this interact badly with connection pooling?"
