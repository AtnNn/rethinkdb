      "> * Bring back `/ajax/me`\r\n* Infer which server we're connected to by looking at IP addresses and ports (which would be provided in `rethinkdb.server_status`)\r\n* Put it in a pseudo-table somewhere\r\n* Make the current server be the first returned object in `server_status`?\r\n\r\nI don't like any of these options. I think we can do better.\r\n\r\n> * Add a method or field on the ReQL connection object\r\n\r\nI think this would work great. The server would send its UUID to the connection during the handshake. Then the user could say `conn.server()` and get back that UUID. They could then query the server pseudotable to learn which server they're on, its status, etc. :+1: "
