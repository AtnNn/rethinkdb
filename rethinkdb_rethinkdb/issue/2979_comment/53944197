      "- Sending the server id everytime we open a connection seems like a bad idea. It's extra traffic for something not useful in 99% of the cases\r\n- Having `id` instead of `uuid` would make things easier to integrate with Backbone (web ui stuff)\r\n- Why don't we just have `conn.server()` that returns the name of the server? Isn't `conn.server` something only for the web ui? We can return `{id: ..., name: ...}` if we expect people from using it."
