      "> Sending the server id everytime we open a connection seems like a bad idea.\r\n\r\nThat sounds reasonable, though it's debatable if this would actually cause any performance issues. The difference between sending 1 byte and 16 bytes is possibly negligible.\r\n\r\n> Why don't we just have `conn.server()` that returns the name of the server?\r\n\r\nIt's a little weird to do it on a connection because we don't have any other cases where you get information from the server that way (in all other cases, you call a reql command via `.run()`). This might be different because it's a unique case. Marking this as reql proposal -- I think this issue is worth discussing as one because it will set a precedent for other similar commands/methods in the future."
