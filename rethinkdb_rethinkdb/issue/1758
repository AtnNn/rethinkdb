        "Similar to #209, I am trying to do a conditional upsert (but in JS rather than Ruby, and alas I can't ready the Ruby to translate). There's an example of using replace() with a function in #210 but I can't find any documentation on what a conditional upsert should look like in the official docs.\r\n\r\nConditional upserts are common enough: sometimes I fetch something from a third party and might have an older copy I want to save over. It would be useful to have an example for the main languages in the docs. "
