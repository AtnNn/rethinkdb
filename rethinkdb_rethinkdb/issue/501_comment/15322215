      "Here is a fix for the OS X package.\r\n\r\nThe OS X installer on Lion thought that it did not support x86_64, so I rewrote the test in javascript.\r\n\r\nI do not have a 32 bit OS X machine to test that the package refuses to install. If my script works, the error message should be a little nicer than just \"RethinkDB can't be installed on this computer\"."
