      "Sorry -- what happened is that the old version of RethinkDB was installed in a different path (`/usr/bin/` and `/usr/share`). That wasn't ideal, so the new version is installed into a different (and better) directory -- `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/share`. If you're uninstalling, you should typically use the uninstall script that came with that particular version of the software (this is what other products do as well).\r\n\r\nIn this case, if you don't have the original uninstall script, could you delete the two directories manually? (These are the only places where RethinkDB writes files, so that would be ok)."
