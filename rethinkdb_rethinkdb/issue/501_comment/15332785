      "@atnnn Your commit is testing whether machine is 64bit or not. But remember i was able to run 1.3.2 version on my machine without any problem. On the very same machine i am trying to install 1.4 version. If i can install 1.3.2, i must be able to install 1.4 as well. So i suspect problem is some where else not this!"
