      "So, there isn't much enforcement on the files present in the import directory, but I suppose we can either have it fail when an unexpected file is found, or print out which files were ignored.\r\n\r\nAs for what a user should do in this case, concatenating the files wouldn't work directly (we interpret json files as an array of json objects, so they would need a little extra in there).  But it would be pretty easy to do a `find | xargs` for batches of files."
