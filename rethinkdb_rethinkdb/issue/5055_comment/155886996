      "I have a bump committed into `next` with c7fe5309. I changed the numbers in `configure`, `browserify.sh`, and `browserify.shrinkwrap`. Notably I did not change the lower-bound in `configure` or touch anything in `./admin/package.json`. This allows us to build, and some basic browsing both from my local build and one on `newton` (both with cleaned `./external` folders) work as expected.\r\n\r\nI will be filing a separate bug to rationalize how we do all of this."
