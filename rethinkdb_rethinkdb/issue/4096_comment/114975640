      "@RaitoBezarius, when a query response arrives, it can indicate that it is just the first batch of a larger result - this is when we create a Cursor object.  The Cursor is instantiated with the original batch of data, but will request more immediately (pre-fetching) to reduce latency.  Since the first batch of a normal cursor contains data (changefeeds are different - they may or may not have data in the first batch) - this test makes sure that the cursor will return the data it has already received from the server before stopping due to the `close`."
