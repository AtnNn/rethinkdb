      "@Tryneus: If it can help you with Twisted, you can play around with the driver.\r\nType in a terminal: `python -m twisted.conch.stdio` and you will get a magic REPL!\r\nYou can import rethinkdb. Set the Twisted loop type. A reactor will be automagically run and all Deferred will be resolved / errback-ed effortlessly.\r\n\r\nIt can help you to test the driver in a REPL (which is quite cool)."
