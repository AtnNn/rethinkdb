      "@RaitoBezarius: first you need to build the server (see instructions [here](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/build/).  Once that is done, you should go to the `test/rql_test/` directory and run ` ./test-runner -i py connections/twisted_connection --verbose`.  Let me know if you have any trouble getting these steps to work."
