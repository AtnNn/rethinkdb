      "@Tryneus I've finally succeeded to make tests works, and then, I've discovered that a lot of the Cursor API is broken and does not work as expected.\r\nI have one question about how cursor works.\r\nFor example, this test:\r\n```python\r\n    @asyncio.coroutine\r\n    def test_cursor_after_cursor_close(self):\r\n        cursor = yield from r.range().run(self.conn)\r\n        cursor.close()\r\n        count = 0\r\n        while (yield from cursor.fetch_next()):\r\n            yield from cursor.next()\r\n            count += 1\r\n        self.assertNotEqual(count, 0, \"Did not get any cursor results\")\r\n```\r\nIf I understand correctly, it means that a cursor fetch immediately when it is instantiated some data.\r\nI have some issues to visualize mentally how this data fetching happen and where?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I've answered many of your line notes, please take a look and let me know if I've forgotten something!"
