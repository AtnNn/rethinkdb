      "Ok, @RaitoBezarius, I've taken a look and commented on a few things that looked off.  Primarily, though, the tests won't run, so I can't do any manual verification (especially useful because I'm new to Twisted).  Sorry about the delay in getting to this, but please take a look and let me know your thoughts."
