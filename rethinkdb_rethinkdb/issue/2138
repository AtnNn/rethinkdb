        "I have built an automated failover tool that aggressively marks machines as dead in order to maximise write availability. My system also automatically reaps zombie/ghost machines and allows them to rejoin and sync.\r\n\r\nHowever, after these ghosts have been reaped there is no means to delete them from the semilattice.\r\nI haven't observed this causing problems yet but I would like to be able to delete these entries.\r\nI realize this is an unsafe operation if the ghost isn't truly dead and gone but in my case I am sure this is the case."
