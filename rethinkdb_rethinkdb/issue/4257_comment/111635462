      "The file causing this test failure is `clustering_contract_coordinator.cc`.\r\n\r\nThis failure seems unique to boost 1.56, related to https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10825 . The solution recommended in that thread does not work.\r\n\r\nUpgrading boost to 1.58 seems to fix this issue, but it causes other build failures on newton. Boost 1.58 doesn't seem to like GCC 4.6's libstdc++.\r\n\r\nI tried overloading `operator<<` for `boost::optional<uuid_u>`, but couldn't get the compiler to pick it over `boost::operator<<`."
