      "I just checked bumping a build on newton to Boost 1.58 with GCC 4.6.3 and it was happy building, as was a build locally on MacOS[1]. @AtnNn was there a specific version of GCC that was blowing up on this? If not I would love to clear out this issue so MacOS could run unittests.\r\n\r\nPinging @VeXocide for any comments about Boost 1.58.\r\n\r\n[1] There are enough general problems in testing right now that I don't want to venture any assertions about the quality of the executable that this produces."
