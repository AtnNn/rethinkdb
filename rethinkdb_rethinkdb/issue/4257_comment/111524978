      "@larkost @neumino What version of boost do you have installed? Could you please test if the build still fails with `./configure --fetch boost`?\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce this issue. The error seems to indicate that `boost::operator<<` is missing for `std::set<uuid_u>` and `std::optional<uuid_u>`."
