      "@danielmewes @VeXocide \r\n\r\nOur use case is:\r\n\r\n- We don't have a fancy data warehousing solution, because \128176 \8987 \128560 \r\n- We want to be able to run up-to-date analysis w/ prod data\r\n\r\nI feel like that's a pretty common situation for startups and small companies that use RethinkDB as their primary datastore. With PG/MySQL, it's somewhat simple to do a read-only replica. With MongoDB, you can setup read-only secondaries that are only queried by analysts."
