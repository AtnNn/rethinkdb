      "I looked into it before and while I can set a getter for specific properties on the this object or even for global variables there does not seem to be a way to handle requests for the this object itself. If we don't explicitly set `this` to the empty object it should default to `window` which will contain any global variables as properties.\n\nWe could set a getter for a `self` property on the window object which would allow references to `self` to resolve to the implicit variable, but the special handling of `this` makes this impossible."
