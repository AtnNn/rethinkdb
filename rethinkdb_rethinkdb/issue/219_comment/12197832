      "@jdoliner is right. In V8 `this` can only be set to an object. When the implicit variable is something other than a RQL object we use the empty object as a default.\n\nWe will be completely changing how `js` works in 1.4, requiring that all variables be passed to `js` explicitly and thus removing this confusing feature entirely."
