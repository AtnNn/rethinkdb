        "Say we have a workload consisting of lots of small writes with soft durability.\r\nThe cache will count the superblock and the stat block towards the unsaved data limit once for every transaction.\r\n\r\nThe unsaved data limit is effectively reduced by a factor of up to to 3 when using point updates/inserts compared to batched operations.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this has a big impact on performance on SSDs. However more research is required to confirm the importance of this issue."
