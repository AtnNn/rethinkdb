        "I am finding that the soft writes are still not very soft. When it comes to inserting performance on spinning disk single thread Small objects less then 1kb I am getting about 150/sec on normal writes, 300/sec on soft writes. If I batch the writes I can get 2-5k/sec During the soft writes I am not seeing my memory usage spike just based on the added performance I have seen on batched writes I would think adding an even softer durability on writes letting them sit in memory and let the process batch them together and write them to disk would be a useful option. \n"
