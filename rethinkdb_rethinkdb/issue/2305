        "This actually slows down development time a lot -- it's more of an issue than building when working on most ReQL issues.  (I just timed it, and `make rb_polyglot` alone takes ~2 minutes on Newton.)\n\nThere are several things we should do to fix this:\n- Separate the slow-running tests from the long-running tests.  The slow-running tests can still be run before every release.  (Most of the slow-running tests test things that are unlikely to break from 99% of changes, like waiting on sindexes.)\n- Stop creating and dropping tables for every test.  We should re-use tables (and maybe even indexes) between tests, and delete everything from the tables at the end.\n- Consider running the tests in parallel.\n"
