        "C4 is a model for maintaining open source projects and has been used successfully for ZeroMQ and other projects. See https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/, a [blog post describing the success](http://hintjens.com/blog:93), and in particular this graph:\r\n\r\n![Commits per week](http://hintjens.com/local--files/blog:93/graph.png)\r\n\r\nBasically, any PR that follows C4 will be accepted. A new role, \"Project Maintainers\" verify that PRs conform to the spec and then merge them. \r\n\r\n> What is most fun is that ZeroMQ takes zero management these days. It is self-steering, self-feeding, and self-organizing. We have applied C4.1 to old projects like libzmq, and brand new ones. The results are the same. If the project does something useful, it takes off, and contributors join, and everyone enjoys themselves.\r\n\r\n> C4.1 is an exothermic process. It produces almost perfect software. ZeroMQ's oddities all date from before 2012, and are slowly disappearing. ZeroMQ master is almost always stable. It just does not break stable APIs or protocols. The mailing list is polite and happy. We do not argue."
