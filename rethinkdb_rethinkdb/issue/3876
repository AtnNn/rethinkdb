        "The `bag` option in the Javascript polyglot test \"driver\" is giving intermittent false negatives because the sort function it uses to make sense of things is implemented only as a less-then-or-equal test, rather than a more complete test that gives three responses: less than, equal, or more than.\n\nA truly complete solution would replace the central comparison system to output the 3 responses from above and then use that, as that covers all of our methods. The Ruby \"driver\" currently does this, but the Python driver similarly misses this but does not have the sorting problem.\n\n@danielmewes and I decided that we need to fix the immediate problem in sorting, but are punting on the more complicated fix for the Python and JavaScript drivers.\n"
