      "Is there any specific version of v8 you're aiming for?\r\n\r\nNode.js 6 will be built on v8 5.0, which has an extensive ES6 support. Since Node.js 6 will be a long term support release, I think it would be great if RethinkDB had the same or newer v8 (probably not for 2.3, but some time during 2016 would be nice). \r\n\r\nThis is just a nice to have feature, I guess mostly to keep syntax the same between newer ES6 Node.js projects and the Administration interface (if that's relevant at all, and the code entered there is processed by the v8 and not some driver translating the code before it gets to the server)."
