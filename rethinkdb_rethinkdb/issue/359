        "I have a table with ~5M documents and I tried this:\r\n\r\nr.db('test').table('test').orderBy('id').limit(10).run()\r\n\r\nrethinkdb then used up 100% cpu for about 20 minutes and ram usage went to about the size of the table on disk\r\n\r\n5.6G 18 Feb 00:25 9a87ef8d-1d61-4cc5-87a4-b6f6b49aab33\r\n\r\nthe admin ui disconnected for about 5-10 minutes during which time I couldn't connect at all, cpu went back to normal but 24 hours later and rethink is still using about 4.1GB looking at the RSIZE column in top, would this be a leak or it just trying to keep a huge cache on a failed query?\r\n\r\nI don't like that trying to order a table can essentially bring down the db and I'm wondering how I would mitigate this?"
