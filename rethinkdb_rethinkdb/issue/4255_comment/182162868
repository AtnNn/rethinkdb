      "I think we actually *only* have the 24 hour timeout for servers that we got with `-j`.\r\n\r\nOnce we have successfully connected to a given server, we use a different but similar code path (the `auto_reconnector_t` rather than the `initial_joiner_t`) to reconnect to that server at its last known address. In contrast to `initial_joiner_t`, `auto_reconnector_t` never stops trying to reconnect as far as I can tell."
