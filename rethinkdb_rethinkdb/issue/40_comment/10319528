      "Euh, I'm not sure to understand what you are talking about. Are you refering to these warnings\r\n```\r\nwarn: Error in collecting system stats (on demand): Could not open '/proc/net/dev': No such file or directory (errno = 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf yes, I just did a little more testing. The warnings appear only when I'm doing a request to /ajax/stats (I did request this page manually).\r\n/proc/net is a symbolic link to /proc/self/net\r\n/proc/self/net/dev does exist but has the following rights\r\n-r--r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 13 09:42 dev\r\n\r\nAlso I get some \"errors\" in /ajax/stats like for example\r\n```\r\n\"bytes_sent\": {\r\n\"avg\": \"-\",\r\n\"max\": \"-\",\r\n\"min\": \"-\",\r\n\"per_sec\": \"0.00000000\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little more about my server\r\n```\r\nLinux ***** 3.2.13-grsec-xxxx-grs-ipv6-64 #1 SMP Thu Mar 29 09:48:59 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nChanging the chmod didn't solve the problem (I added rwx for everyone - and I did restart the server).\r\nIs it because of the symbolic link?"
