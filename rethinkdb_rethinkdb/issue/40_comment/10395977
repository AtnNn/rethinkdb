      "Alright, I think I know the root of the /proc/net problem.  It looks like you're running a kernel with grsecurity patches, which prevents non-root users from reading /proc/net by default.  There's theoretically a configuration option CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PROC_USER somewhere that controls this, but I didn't want to start messing around with your server config.\r\n\r\n@srh - OS X doesn't have /proc at all, right?  What are we planning to do for the port?  Maybe we should just do that by default and solve this problem for people with hardened kernels.\r\n\r\nThat just leaves the perfmon stuff, which I'd like to talk to @jdoliner about.  I'll try to wake up earlier tomorrow and do that."
