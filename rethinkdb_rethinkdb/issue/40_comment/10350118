      "Ah, I see, I was confused about the scope of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem I was addressing was the guarantee fail that resulted in a crash.  We now fail to parse the tcp message if the path is malformed rather than failing a guarantee.  The next question is \"what was sending the malformed path?\", but if you were point to /ajax/stats by hand maybe you just mistyped.\r\n\r\nI'll work on the proc/net/dev stuff."
