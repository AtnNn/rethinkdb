      "So, here's the current state of this bug:\r\n* The guarantee failure seems fixed.\r\n* I can't reproduce the /proc/net/dev thing at all on an Ubuntu 12.04 VM.  @neumino -- do you still get it with the latest version from launchpad?  If so, could I come look at this on whatever machine you can reproduce it on tomorrow?\r\n* The empty entries in /ajax/stat seems to be a problem with the perfmons.  I've tried to debug it but they're more complicated than I was expecting and I can't really figure out what's supposed to be happening.  For some reason the `bytes_sent` entry only seems to log the number of bytes sent inside of `connectivity_cluster_t::send_message` **while the /ajax/stat request is outstanding**.  I.e. if I make several requests in rapid succession before the first one returns then I can get some numbers there, but otherwise it's always empty.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner -- I seem to remember you knowing something about the perfmons.  Is there any chance you'd be willing to take this bug, or alternately pair program it with me so that I learn how the perfmons work?"
