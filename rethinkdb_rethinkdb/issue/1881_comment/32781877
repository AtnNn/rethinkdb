      "@ianjuma The problem seems to be that your `protobuf` Python library does not include the C++ backend.\r\n\r\nYou can just unset `PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION` to use the Python backend.\r\n\r\nIf you need extra performance, you can install the C++ backend for the `protobuf` Python library by following the instructions on our site:\r\nhttp://rethinkdb.com/docs/driver-performance/\r\n\r\nor in the Protocol Buffers README file:\r\n\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/protobuf/source/browse/trunk/python/README.txt"
