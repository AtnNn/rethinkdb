      "@mscook I believe that error is usually caused by having multiple versions of the python protobuf package or if the protobuf package was not installed with the native C++ extension.\r\n\r\nWhat is the output of the following commands?\r\n\r\nCheck which protobuf package is being used by python:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython -c 'import google.protobuf as p; print p.__path__'\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest that the C++ backend is installed:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython -c 'from google.protobuf.internal import cpp_message'\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can join us on [#rethinkdb on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#rethinkdb) if you need any help."
