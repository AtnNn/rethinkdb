      "Hi @brwnll , this is probably because `orderBy` in your case doesn't use an index but has to load the whole table into memory first.\r\nYou could create an index on `name` and change the query as follows:\r\n`r.table('businesses').orderBy('name', {index: 'name'}).slice(100, 200)`\r\n\r\nNote that if you need the pagination to remain efficient over a large number of pages, this is still not quite sufficient because `slice` will still have to scan over all the documents that are being skipped.\r\nThis blog post http://www.rethinkdb.com/blog/beerthink/ has a great description of how you can make pagination really efficient."
