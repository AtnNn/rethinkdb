        "I have a POJO with an enum field inside and that field is set to `null` by `toReqlAst`.\r\n\r\nLooking in the driver code at  `Util#toReqlAst` there are checks for some types (`Map`, `Number`, `String`) and if the field is not of any of these types `toMap` is performed. But it doesn\8217t work for enum classes.\r\n\r\nI\8217m thinking of adding a check for enum classes and if a field is an enum class call it\8217s `name()` method."
