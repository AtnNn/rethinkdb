      "So, we've been using both the terms \"data collector\" and \"reduction\" for the same thing for a while in different pieces of documentation.  (Or at least I called them data collectors in the Ruby language docs way back when, and I refere to them that way in conversation.)\r\n\r\nI think we should pick a term and stick to it.  I sort of don't like the term \"reduction\" because in my mind a reduction is something you can pass to `reduce`, and you can't pass any of our \"reduction\" objects to reduce."
