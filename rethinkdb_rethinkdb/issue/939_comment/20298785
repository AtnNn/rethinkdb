      "The current todo list is:\r\n\r\n- making the data block manager support grouped writes instead of one block at a time (every other piece of infrastructure regarding oddly sized writes is in place in the serializer and data block manager)\r\n- making the buffer cache support specifying smaller blocks (this was done before in an abandoned branch that attacked the problem starting with the cache instead of the serializer, so its difficulty is known -- and not large)\r\n- actually specifying smaller blocks (in blob code)\r\n\r\nThis is sufficient to meet the needs of the issue.\r\n\r\nA further nice-to-have would be:\r\n\r\n- not allocating a full 4K block in memory for a block that's actually only 300 bytes.\r\n\r\nThat's somewhat tricky."
