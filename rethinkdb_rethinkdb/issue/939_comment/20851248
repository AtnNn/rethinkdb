      "Right now the changes have made it to the buffer cache and file size seems to be shrunken down quite a bit.  However, throughput is getting hurt because a whole bunch of copying is done on the serializer's thread, and it's bottlenecking CPU.  So that work needs to be done on the buffer cache thread before getting sent to the serializer.  Also we need to be able to support actually truncating the fiel if it shrinks."
