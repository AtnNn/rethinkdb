      "Also, making the serializer support variable sized blocks is not that scary.  It requires the following changes:\r\n\r\n- The LBA needs to store size alongside offset.\r\n- Serializer data block GC algorithms are directly generalizable to arbitrary block sizes.\r\n- Block reads and writes would need to be transformed into aligned reads and writes.\r\n- The buffer cache needs to support users marking blocks as truncated."
