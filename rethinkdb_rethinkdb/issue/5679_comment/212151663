      "Thanks for the proposal @cefn . That makes sense. I also think that it's somewhat inconsistent to have the dictionary-style syntax for `filter` but not being able to use that same syntax elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about how to best integrate this into ReQL, but having an additional term as you suggest that behaves like `filter` except that it returns `true` or `false` and is applied to a single item rather than a stream might be the way to go. We unfortunately can't call it `match` because we already have a term called `match` for string matching."
