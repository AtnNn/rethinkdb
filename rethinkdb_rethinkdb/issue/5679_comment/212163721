Or the `.partialMatch({...})` you suggested?\r\n\r\nWe'll try to schedule this for one of the upcoming ReQL discussions (we usually have ReQL discussion periods at the beginning of planning the next release, and we always pick a handful of ReQL_proposal issues to discuss). We'll see what others think then."
