      "1. `connection.run` requires a callback: that's a bug in our documentation. As an workaround, you can pass in an empty object {}\r\n\r\n2. Distribute a non-minified version: there's already a bug open for it: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/222\r\n\r\n3. We plan to improve the way `r.connect` works, but I need to write the proposal and attach it to this issue: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/221\r\n\r\n4. Unfortunately I'm not sure I understand your 1st point. Would you mind expanding a bit?"
