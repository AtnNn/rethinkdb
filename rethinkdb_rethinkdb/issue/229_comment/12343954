      "@seanhess The general crappyness of the JS driver is my fault, I'm sorry for your frustrations. The new JS driver is tentatively scheduled for mid February along with many other major changes. Indeed, it is because the underlying protobuf spec has been rewritten that we decided to rewrite the whole driver. Unfortunately, the magnitude of such changes does mean that we've both been neglecting the fix the current driver and that the new one will take time to push out. Thank you for your patience."
