      "Aha! The problem is I went through the ten minute guide, which has you create two servers. Then, I went on to use my client driver and ran into all kinds of problems. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has done things in that order. I was hung up a little on that error, because I was previously getting the port wrong (29015, again since we used that port in the 10 minute guide I thought that was right). \r\n\r\nSo I've resolved my issue, but I do think we should:\r\n\r\n1. Figure out how to help people clean up their installations after the ten minute guide or they'll hit the same problem. \r\n\r\n2. Distribute a non-minified version of the driver for node servers\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nFYI I'm on OSX, I ran `rethinkdb` in my home directory, and I'm using driver version `1.2.6-1`. Thanks! "
