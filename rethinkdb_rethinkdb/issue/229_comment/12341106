      "Sure. If you are a new rethinkdb user with no idea what you're doing, you might make the same mistake. Here's what I did. \r\n\r\n1. Go to rethinkdb.com, follow the 30 second guide\r\n2. Click through to the ten minute guide at the bottom of the page. That has you make a second shard\r\n3. Click through to the driver's page. Install your driver. \r\n4. Get frustrated the node driver example doesn't work. Change a bunch of stuff. \r\n5. Stumble onto javascript reference http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/#js\r\n6. Triple check that you have everything right, and it STILL doesn't work, because you created a second shard in step 2. You have to remember to restart the second shard (by now I've forgotten the command), or go in to the manager and delete it. \r\n\r\nMaybe I'm still not getting something,  but if setting up a second shard/server makes it so `rethinkdb` is not enough to make the db work again, I would make a big warning or something.
