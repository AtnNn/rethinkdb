      "Ok, I've made the following updates:\r\n\r\n1. The client drivers page (http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guides/drivers/) now contains a copy-pastable example that won't cause the race with the connection\r\n2. The docs for `run` are now fixed (http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/#js:accessing_rql-run)\r\n3. The ten minute guide has a warning at the very end about `rethinkdb_data` directory (http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guides/ten-min/)\r\n4. I added issue #234 (Improve 'cannot compute blueprint' message)\r\n\r\nWe'll remove minification and continue improving the docs. The new drivers should be out by mid-Feb.\r\n"
