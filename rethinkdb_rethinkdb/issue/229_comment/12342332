      "@seanhess -- thanks so much for reporting this! Here's what I think we'll do:\r\n\r\n1. The example on the client drivers page actually works if you type it in line by line (which is how we erroneously thought people would use it). I'll fix it to use proper node callbacks. (*done*)\r\n2. As @al3xandru mentioned, the missing callback in the docs is clearly an error. I'll fix that too. (*done*)\r\n3. We'll find a way to warn people to be careful about the cluster setup after the tutorial (*done*)\r\n\r\nThe new drivers are scheduled to be released on Feb 14th, and they should resolve some of the problems here and use more common node.js conventions. We'll also fix minification oversight then too.\r\n\r\nThis is really wonderful feedback -- if you run into more confusing things, please, please, please report them! (most people tend to assume it's their fault and move on once they work things out, so we never get to hear about these issues)"
