      "Pinging to make sure we're all on the same page about the resolution. I saw two reasonable proposals:\r\n\r\n* Add a troubleshooting entry to the docs\r\n* Add a warning to the returned error message\r\n\r\nAdding an entry to the troubleshooting docs is obviously a good idea so I created https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/194 for it.\r\n\r\nI think adding the warning that might point people in the right direction is a good idea, but we'd have to do it for all the drivers. I'd like to move this out of 1.11.x for now since we have a ton of work to do. We can pick this up at any point during a polish stage.\r\n\r\nFeel free to move back if you disagree."
