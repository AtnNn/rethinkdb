      "Yep, I think it's nicer to keep the number of type of errors small.\r\n\r\nUp in review 1176 assigned to @Tryneus \r\nBranch michel_1928_connect\r\n\r\nResult\r\n```\r\nRqlDriverError: Could not connect to 192.168.42.5:28015.\r\nconnect EHOSTUNREACH\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI also don't get an error when I open too many connections. I just get a timeout.\r\nNot sure if it's related to Linux or not. I also confirm that I can open about 4000 connections (tried that on two machines)."
