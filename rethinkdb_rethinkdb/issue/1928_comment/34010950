      "@luizfilipe -- it may be that OS X is limiting the number of open files you can have (242 looks suspiciously like 256 minus a little bit).  What is the output when you run `ulimit -a`?\r\n\r\nIf that is the problem, you can just increase the limit.  (I think the method differs in different OS X versions; http://superuser.com/questions/261023/how-to-change-default-ulimit-values-in-mac-os-x-10-6 suggests that you should use `launchctl` now.)"
