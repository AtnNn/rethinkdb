      "@luizfilipe not sure.  If you turn up `ulimit -n` even higher can you get more than 1000?  If not, there might be some other OS limit.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why you wouldn't be seeing this in the older version.  Maybe one version of the language you're using to run the driver adjusts its own limits and the other doesn't?"
