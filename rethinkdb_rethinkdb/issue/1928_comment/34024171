      "@mlucy but even with a roof limit, i think the message is not helpful, the user have to research about it to understand the problem and find a solution, maybe this is not fair with the user, 'cause in the beginning i just think that is a RethinkDB limitation and i leave this like a RethinkDB limit until Joey from RethinkDB contact me about shirts and ask me about RethinkDB limitations. When you read the error, you don't feel this message is a little unhelpful for a common RethinkDB user?\r\n\r\nBut for sure can be a problem with the node version, the mid2012 is using a 0.10.24, and i think mid2010 using the same, i will see tomorrow cause mid2010 is a computer of my young brother.\r\n\r\nI forget to say he's not with me now but tomorrow i'll see this with more caution, just to be sure if this can be an solution.\r\n\r\nI just want help to improve RethinkDB, it's an awesome nosql solution."
