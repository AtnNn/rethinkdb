      "I think it would be practical to embed the Lua interpreter directly into the RethinkDB process instead of running it in a subprocess. The Lua interpreter is designed to be embedded in a C program. It's fully reentrant; the interpreter state lives in a structure instead of in global variables. It's also possible to control its resource usage; we could limit how much memory an evaluation uses, force it to yield the CPU to another coroutine every 1,000 instructions, etc."
