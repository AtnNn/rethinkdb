      "Other neat properties of Lua that may or may not be relevant:\r\n\r\n* If we embed a Lua interpreter in RethinkDB, it's very easy to expose C functions to Lua. For example, we could use this to let a Lua program process a datum stream without having to send the entire stream at once; or we could let Lua code run read and write queries (but we'd have to embed ReQL in Lua, and that would be a non-trivial amount of work).\r\n\r\n* Lua makes it easy to access the bytecode representation of Lua functions. So we could e.g. compile a function in one Lua context, then distribute the compiled bytecode to other Lua contexts.\r\n\r\nAgain, these may or may not be relevant."
