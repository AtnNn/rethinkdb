      "What's interesting is that the infrastructure you're describing is already built to support the `r.js` command. We have code to start external processes, communicate with them via pipes, kill them if they get out of control, serialize json back and forth, etc. It would be fairly easy to support arbitrary custom languages on top of this infrastructure, so it's mostly a matter of prioritization and compelling use cases."
