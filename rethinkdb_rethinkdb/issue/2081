        "This issue is incredibly pedantic, but I felt like I should bring it up. If you go to a table in the web interface and look at the shards, it will say something like `Shard: [ -\8734, +\8734]` but it should really be `Shard: (-\8734, +\8734)`. The reason is that the parenthesis denotes that numbers belonging to the range approach but never reach something, whereas the bracket denotes that the numbers belonging to a range do, indeed, reach a particular number. Infinity \"is an abstract concept\" ([according to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity)), not a number. It cannot ever be reached. Hence, parentheses should be used when referencing infinity. Or at least that's what my Algebra 2 teacher said a couple weeks ago :smile: \n"
