      "So, here's an update:\r\n* @simo2409 sent me a script that reliably reproduces the bug for him when run against two release CentOS servers from a client running on Ruby 1.9 on OS X.\r\n* I am unable to reproduce the bug when running against two release Ubuntu servers from a client running Ruby 1.9 on OS X.\r\n\r\nThe next logical step is to test against a CentOS build.\r\n\r\n@atnnn or @neumino -- do you happen to have a CentOS build of 1.7 / a CentOS VM lying around?"
