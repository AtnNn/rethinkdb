      "So, Simone gave me a dump, and when I import that dump and insert it the same way he did, I don't get the same error.  I had to translate the dump from a SQL dump, though, so it's possible I messed something up during that step.\r\n\r\nI trespassed further on Simone's generosity and asked whether he'd be able to provide a standalone script that reproduces the problem for him, since it might be something subtle.  If he's willing to do that, and I still can't reproduce it, pair-programming the problem or just handing it off to a fresh set of eyes might be a good idea."
