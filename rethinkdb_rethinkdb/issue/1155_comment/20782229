      "I was wrong sorry, I did another try and the problem still persists (even on self-compiled RethinkDB) but I think to understood the problem.\r\n\r\nI try to repeat everything to make it clear:\r\n\r\n1 - I installed RethinkDB from CentOS build and I started 2 instances => Error\r\n2 - I compiled RethinkDB from sources and I started 1 instance => Works\r\n3 - Still using RethinkDB from sources, I started 2 instances => Error\r\n\r\nSo this makes me think that the problem appears only when there are 2 instances connected.\r\n2 instances are connected but 1 is completely un-used (db has only 1 shard in total and there is no replication setup)"
