      "The problem with python is yielding each and every  iteration of for or while loops and capturing them. So we can't do that.\r\nIn motor , work around is to yield ```cursor.fetch_next``` and get value using ```.next_object()```\r\n```python\r\n @gen.coroutine\r\n def do_find():\r\n     cursor = db.test_collection.find({'i': {'$lt': 5}})\r\n     while (yield cursor.fetch_next):\r\n         document = cursor.next_object()\r\n         print document\r\n```"
