      "@deontologician Ok that's good to know. I have no personal preference with respect to whether to support Twisted or Tornado first. My understanding from what @larkost said is that Twisted tends to be slightly easier to install due to more widely available packages.\r\n\r\nIf Tornado is easier to support than Twisted that sounds like we should support Tornado first. Otherwise we should just pick one and then follow up the other one soon (maybe we can even do both for 2.0).\r\n@gchpaco any opinions?"
