      "@gchpaco & @danielmewes - If you refactor the logic to separate the drivers from the core logic the drivers rely on, then at least in theory, each driver should be simpler to build. Tornado is the current favourite among a lot of developers, and would be great, but when you refactor the logic you need to take into account that you need to maintain the existing synchronous driver. \r\n\r\nTwisted has a LOT of documentation regarding its use.\r\n\r\nI would try to refactor the current code to be broken apart like Autobahn has theirs, supporting twisted and regular synchronous python first, then adding tornado & asyncio in whichever order works best. \r\nI dont think the drivers will be the hard part of getting this done, I would expect that after the logic refactoring, the drivers, \"Synchronous\", \"Twisted\", \"Asyncio\", and \"Tornado\" will all be fairly strait forward.
