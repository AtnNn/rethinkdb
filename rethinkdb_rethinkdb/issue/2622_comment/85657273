      "Note in Motor, you can *create* the cursor without a yield since it hasn't begun I/O yet, just stored the query in a MotorCursor object. Only on the first `yield cursor.fetch_next` do we send the query to the server and get the first batch:\r\n\r\nhttp://motor.readthedocs.org/en/stable/api/motor_cursor.html#motor.MotorCursor.fetch_next\r\n\r\nAlso, I chose the method name `next_object` instead of `next` to avoid interacting with Python's standard iterator protocol in any unexpected way, since a MotorCursor *cannot* act like a standard iterator:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types"
