      "I am now seriously thinking about writing Async Tornado driver for RethinkDB after liking the changefeeds compare to tailable_cursors of MongoDB. \r\nWith changefeed , we can listen for Updates (Like Vote Up/Down)  which is quite nice. Its not possible for MongoDB unless you hack into oplog.\r\n@tonich-sh , i saw re-writing  RethinkDB client in twisted , but does it really necessary? "
