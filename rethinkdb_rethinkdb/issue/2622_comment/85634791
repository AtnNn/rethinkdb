      "@danielmewes, I just tested this and it isn't the expected behavior (this is my fault due to some of the cursor changes in the refactor).  `yield future` will raise a `StopIteration` exception once it is past the end of the cursor.  Unfortunately, if the user doesn't catch this, it interacts poorly with Tornado, which assumes the `StopIteration` means that the coroutine has finished.\r\n\r\nOpened #3974 for this issue."
