      "Thanks a lot for this going forward.I haven't check for long due to being busy with Async chat Implementation on Tornado and Mongo.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes  , what @csytan suggested  true that tornado's coroutines are compatible with asyncio of Python3. It gives you clean code using yield, without needing to worry about callbacks , and thats the reason for web devs choosing tornado over twisted.\r\nTornado have a twisted bridge , I think its bidrectional so if you support tornado , it will support twisted too.\r\n\r\nOne Stone , a flock of birds. Nice? :) \r\n"
