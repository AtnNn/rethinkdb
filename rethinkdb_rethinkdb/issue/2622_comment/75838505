      "Thanks @v3ss0n. Using `to_list` I presume loads all data into the client at once.\r\n\r\nThis isn't quite the same as iterating over the cursor directly which would fetch results in smaller batches only when they are needed. For example you can iterate over a data set that doesn't even fit into memory on the client with a cursor, but not with `to_list`.\r\n\r\nWe still need a way for iterating over a cursor directly.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug Have you found out whether the `in` actually works with `yield` on individual items?"
