      "Hi, I'm a PyMongo committer and Motor's author. Motor supports Tornado using greenlets (so it falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum between an async rewrite of PyMongo vs. running PyMongo in a thread pool), and this year it will support asyncio as well. I plan to abstract away the differences between asyncio and Tornado, and eventually do the same for Twisted. You can see the work in progress here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mongodb/motor/tree/asyncio/motor/frameworks\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions I'm happy to offer **very small** amounts of time to answer them. =)"
