      "@v3ss0n -- thanks for chiming in. I'm moving this to backlog for now because there are much more pressing issues to take care of first, but I agree this would be valuable. As a data point, at least 5 people (may be more) have asked me for this.\r\n\r\nI can't promise when we'll get to it, but I can say with almost complete certainty that there will be support for this eventually."
