      "@gchpaco -- a couple of questions:\r\n\r\n- Could you post some minimal sample code here of how a user would use the driver with the async API?\r\n- Would the old synchronous code still work without modifications?\r\n- Since we have time before the release, could you start working on adding other Python async backends (starting with most common) when the code review goes through?"
