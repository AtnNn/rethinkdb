      "No coroutine can do I/O without executing a yield statement. Look at your code: might it need to talk to the server? Then it must yield. A statement like \"for x in feed\" might need to do I/O to fetch more things, so it must contain a \"yield\" statement.\r\n\r\nSo must its caller, and so on up the chain, so that ultimately you have yielded to the event loop. Otherwise the loop cannot make progress and the I/O does not complete.\r\n\r\nI was like you, once: I thought I could find the way. High and low I sought. But at the end of my seeking, I chose not merely to accept this commandment as a law of nature, but indeed to embrace it was the way of salvation.\r\n\r\nhttps://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2014/02/unyielding.html"
