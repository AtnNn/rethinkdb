      "Similar to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3678#issuecomment-75142374 , we might have to pass the callback into `run` itself, rather than having an `on` method on the cursor. This is to avoid the problem that by default `run` doesn't return anything at all until it has gotten the first batch, which would be a problem here."
