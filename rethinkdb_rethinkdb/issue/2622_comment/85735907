      "Thanks @ajdavis .\r\nFor RethinkDB we need to yield on creating the cursor because we don't know whether a given query actually returns one before getting the first response from the server (some queries return a single value, which we handle differently).\r\n\r\nGood point about the incompatibility with the iterator interface.\r\nWe could certainly use a special `next` function for Tornado cursors (not sure how we would call it). I can't tell whether it's important enough to warrant the separate function though.\r\nI wonder how exactly a script fails if it tries to use a Tornado cursor as an iterator. I'll try that later."
