      "@danielmewes, it's would be fine to iterate over a `TornadoCursor`, as long as you didn't do it eagerly (you would end up with an infinite loop that would probably be OOM-killed), and as far as I can tell, we can't safely do a comprehension like `arr = [(yield x) for x in cursor if (yield cursor.fetch_next())]`.  Taking this into account, we should probably remove iteration from the `TornadoCursor` implementation."
