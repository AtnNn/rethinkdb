      "No, I didn't. Someone who knows Python a little better should look at the API. But you can definitely do this with iterators and generators combo. For example `for x in xrange(10): ...` works, so in our case `for x in feed:` should work too. The difference is that the feed would yield internally (as long as you set `future=True`)."
