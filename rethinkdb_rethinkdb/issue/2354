It would also be nice to report how much the main b-tree uses, too.\r\n\r\nA comment in IRC:\r\n<@wojons>  even if its slow at first and just read the blocks something that when i want to know for debuging reasons i can run its better to have slow visablity then none at all\r\n\r\nI think it would be difficult to performantly do persistently.  The slow version would be doable and be better than nothing."
