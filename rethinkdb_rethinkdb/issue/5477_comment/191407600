      "I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have the short and long versions of the flag behave differently.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, adding an extra flag `--short` just for short version numbers seems like overkill to me.\r\n\r\nHow about a new flag `--short-version`?\r\n\r\nWe also need to think about whether that should include the `-2` in a version such as `2.2.1-2` or not."
