      "The most sensible thing to do would probably be to follow the GNU coding standard here:\r\n\r\n> The first line is meant to be easy for a program to parse; the version number proper starts after the last space [...] If you need to mention the version numbers of libraries which are distributed separately from the package which contains this program, you can do so by printing an additional line of version info for each library you want to mention. Use the same format for these lines as for the first line. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/_002d_002dversion.html#g_t_002d_002dversion"
