      "In general I think that if you mess with non-configuration files managed by a package manager then you should expect problems. However, this is the sort of thing that probably should be installed by a post-install script anyways (both for repair and upgrade reasons). So I think we should fix it to make it robust, probably by actually installing the file to some other location, then copy/replace it into place in the post-install script."
