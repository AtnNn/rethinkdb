      "I agree. I think it may help to understand my motivation for messing with the files.\r\n\r\nRunning rethinkdb in production, the question is simply \"What do you do if rethinkdb crashes?\" The answer of \"It shouldn't crash\" isn't really acceptable to me (see my previous bug reports of rethinkdb crashes :wink: ).\r\n\r\nTo answer that question, I used upstart to create a really simple auto-restart-upon-crash service and replaced y'alls init.d script. It'll only retry 5 times with 30 seconds between each try, which I thought was nice, so if there's a real problem it'll stay down. \r\n\r\nAs it stands, you either have to be running multiple replicas to allow for crashes (a good practice anyway, and what I've ended up adopting), or simply be down when rethinkdb crashes.\r\n\r\nMaybe the solution here really is \"don't do that, silly\", and perhaps #2037 or #2014 or #2327 (or a combination therein) could then be bumped in priority, as they seem to be languishing. This is important for folks that actually want to run rethinkdb in production :smile: "
