      "I like option 1, but here are some suggestions:\r\n* Show the length of the binary. Also, show the first few bytes in hexadecimal. Maybe something like `<binary (8 kB) \"12de8a...\">`\r\n* If people want to extract a binary from a large document, going to the raw view could be a pain. Can we let them expand the binary inline by clicking a button? Or give them a button in the tree/table view to copy the binary to the clipboard? Does it make sense to offer a \"download\" link for the binary, and is that practical?"
