      "I can think of two solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Not print the content, so we would print something like `<binary>` (tree and table views).\r\n2. Print the base64 string or the raw format. The thing is that buffers can be big, and that basically has two consequences:\r\n    - we won't do syntax highlighting\r\n    - there can be a big string in the middle of the documents, which make things not friendly\r\n\r\nI leaning toward 1 mostly because I can't think of a use case where you actually read what's inside a binary.\r\nIf people want to copy/paste the content of the binary, they can still use the raw view.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny opinions on that? If not, I'll probably implement 1 sometime this week."
