      "`bin.data` is base64-encoded, right? Then your code is showing the size of the base64-encoded string, not the size of the binary. If it's not base64-encoded, then shouldn't you escape any control characters in it?\r\n\r\nAlso, for an empty binary, it seems like `<binary, 0 byte, \"...\">` is suboptimal. I suggest `<binary, 0 bytes>` instead. And it shouldn't display the `...` if the binary is so short that the entire thing can be displayed."
