      "Consider printing the data in hexadecimal instead of base64. Hexadecimal is slightly more human-friendly.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is that binary data chunks often start with a magic number that is at least partially human-readable. For example, ELF executables start with `\\x7fELF`, and PNG files start with `\\x89PNG`. So it might be better to try to interpret each byte as ASCII, but display individual bytes in hexadecimal if they aren't printable ASCII. So the ELF header would look something like `7f` `E` `L` `F` ...."
