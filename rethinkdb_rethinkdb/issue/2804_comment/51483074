      "We round the size to one digit after the decimal point, so the approximation sounds reasonable to me.\r\nThe only case where things don't work that well is when the binary is less than 1KB.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can also add a `~` character just before the size of the document.\r\nI can change the formula to use `Math.ceil`, but I would prefer not parse the base 64 string to avoid freezing the interface."
