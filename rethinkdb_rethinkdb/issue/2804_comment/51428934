      "Multiplying the size 3/4 is only approximately correct. The size of the base64 encoded string will be `4*ceil(raw_size/3)`; for example, a 1-byte or 2-byte raw string will produce a 4-byte base64 encoded string. To find the exact size of the original input, multiply the size of the base64 string by 3/4 and then subtract the number of `=` characters at the end of the base64 string.\r\n\r\nAlso, you made a typo; for an empty binary it will print `<binary, 0 bytes\">` where it should print `<binary, 0 bytes>`."
