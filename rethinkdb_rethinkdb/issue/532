        "Right now the key length for secondary indexes is limiting and we crash if people go over it. Here's what we need to do:\r\n\r\n - Create a hard cap for primary keys which is less than `250`. Remember we need to use a concatenation of the secondary and primary keys for secondary indexes so we need to save some space for the secondaries.\r\n\r\n- When a secondary index key concatenated with its primary key goes over `250` we truncate the secondary index key.\r\n\r\n- This leads to some possible false positives in sindex reads (when sindex keys have long identical prefixes) which we will need to filter out after the query."
