      "This build failure only happens in DEBUG=1 mode (because THROWS_ONLY compiles differently in release mode).  I think it's a bug in the version of Clang -- the exception specifications certainly don't differ.  Commenting out the exception specification for perform_immediate_op's argument fixes this.\r\n\r\nIn branch sam_1549, review 983, merged to next as of 6ca38a5690f6985ee85cc7dcf58df75cd4c01e16."
