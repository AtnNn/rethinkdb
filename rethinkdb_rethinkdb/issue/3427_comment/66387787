      "Ah I think that would work. In that case we should consider disconnected replicas in the progress, and assign them a value of 0.\r\n\r\nIn that case we should always have the value, and just set it to `1` when everything is ready.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what to do with replicas that are considered connected but time out when we try to obtain their backfill status. If for some reasons we get those timeouts frequently (slow network or high load or something), but they're not quite long enough to cause a full disconnect, it might look a little weird. We could ignore them in the progress maybe (i.e. reduce `n`)?"
