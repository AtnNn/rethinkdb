      "When the `table_status` table fetches backfill progress, it should apply a timeout to the queries it sends to other servers, so that the `table_status` table still works even if a server freezes. But what should `sync_progress` show in this case?\r\n\r\nMaybe we should call it `backfill_progress`, since we use the term \"backfill\" in other places. We certainly don't want people to confuse this with the `.sync()` ReQL command."
