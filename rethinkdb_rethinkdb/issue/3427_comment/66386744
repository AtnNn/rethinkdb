      "@deontologician I think that would be trickier to implement. We would have to keep track of how many replicas needed to be backfilled at the beginning of the latest table reconfiguration. That would require some extra bookkeeping on the server side.\r\n\r\nI believe starting from something larger than 0 is fine if we present it as a \"syncing\" status. Maybe that would be an argument in favor of calling it `sync_progress` and not `backfill_progress` in `table_status` actually?"
