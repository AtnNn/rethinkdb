      "If we call it `backfill_progress`, I think we could just ignore servers that time out or are not connected in the computation. We would adjust `n`, the total number of replicas to only count servers from which we have information.\r\nThat would mean that the progress would sometimes jump back to a lower value if a missing server reconnects or a server that used to time out starts replying again. I think that's ok."
