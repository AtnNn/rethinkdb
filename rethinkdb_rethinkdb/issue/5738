I don't appear to have any code in that stack trace... let me know if there's anything else you'd like me to do to help track it down. For now I'm just throwing it here to help other folks googling.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Erg, just got it again with node 5.9.1. The code hasn't changed since March, so I'm fairly confident it started happening when I updated Node, Rethink, and the Rethink driver all at once... I'll keep trying different downgrades later this evening and see if I can track it down."
