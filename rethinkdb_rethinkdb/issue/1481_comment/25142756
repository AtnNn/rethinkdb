      "If the machine was permanently removed and is picked up as a zombie, it will continue to be a zombie until the data directory where `rethinkdb` is started from has been removed or the data directory specified by your init script -- otherwise the server won't be able to rejoin the cluster.\r\n\r\nYou would have to either:\r\n  - start the process with a different data directory\r\n  - remove the directory entirely\r\n\r\nCorrect?"
