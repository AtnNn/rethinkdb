      "The proper way to remove the zombie machine (solve this issue) is still to kill it.\r\nAdding a hint to reconnect the machine with the same settings makes sense though.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner in which case can deleting the data directory of a zombie machine, going to cause a loss of data?\r\nAs soon as the zombie machine reconnects to the cluster, doesn't it consider its data as obsolete, and therefore delete it?"
