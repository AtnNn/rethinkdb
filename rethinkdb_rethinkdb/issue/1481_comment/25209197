      "I'd be really worried about talking about deleting the data directory in such a short message. It's pretty complicated to explain when deleting the directory isn't going to cause data loss. Complicated enough that we can't explain it without turning that issue into a wall of text. And not fully explaining runs the risk that someone will figure that since the database says \"delete this directory\" it must have an extra copy of the data and there's no risk of dataloss.\r\n\r\nI guess I could be okay with saying: \"If you are absolutely sure you won't lose data then delete the data directory and restart the process.\" But I think I'd prefer to have this issue link to a page on our site that explains in more detail what's going on. It just seems a little too subtle to expect people to learn it from an error message.\r\n\r\nAlso this system is due for a big overhaul sometime fairly soon (post 2.0). In the future you'll have a button to reintegrate the zombie which will make it rejoin the cluster as a fully functional machine and it will keep the old version of the data around in \"recovery-tables\" which are read only tables you can access from the query language and figure out if they contain any data you need."
