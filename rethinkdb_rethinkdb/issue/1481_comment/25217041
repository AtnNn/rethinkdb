      "My hesitation with giving a long form error messages is that I think people tend to have a different mindset when they read error messages than when they read documentation. It's a pretty subtle thing but I think when you're reading an error message and it's surrounded by big red text and warnings you're a lot less likely to learn something new. Your brain just goes in to an emergency mode because you think something has gone wrong. Like I said it's a pretty subtle difference but I actually think how we present this stuff can have a meaningful for a users experience. I generally feel a lot calmer when I see an error and then go to a documentation page to read about it and potentially click around to other pieces of documentation compared to when I just get a really long error message."
