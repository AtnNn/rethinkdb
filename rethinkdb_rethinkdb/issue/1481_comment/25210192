      "@jdoliner: that makes a lot of sense. I think it's reasonable to either give a long-form error message (it's an esoteric case and a fairly confusing one at that) or providing a link to an article on our docs site that details exactly what your options are.\r\n\r\nThe overhaul sounds phenomenal. It may be worth waiting until then -- but if we can improve the text in the interim that would be excellent."
