        "Make it such that if we want to upgrade the serializer format in the future, we can be backwards compatible with the previous file format, instead of requiring an upgrade process.\r\n\r\nThis generally means putting version numbers in magic values in appropriate places, putting serialization format info (in a higher level than the serializer) in other places such as serialized metadata values.\r\n\r\nThis should be done in a way friendly to the possibility of a command that gradually gets the entire disk file up-to-date to the latest format, so that we never need to support formats more than one version old.  This might not be practical in some aspects, but practical in others."
