        "`test-runner` is mostly working in `cygwin` on Windows (see #5180), but is not quite there in the native version of Python for Windows. Regardless of which version of Python `test-runner` gets run from it should be able to find the the versions installed both under `cygwin` and the native version, and be able to run them all.\r\n\r\nThis should be possible without too much trouble from within `cygwin`, as we can just look on the path for `INTERPRETER.exe` and variants (e.g.: `python2.7.exe`) . So I will do that as a first step. My initial thinking is that we should treat the native and `cygwin` versions as separate groups of interpreters, and default to running one version of each."
