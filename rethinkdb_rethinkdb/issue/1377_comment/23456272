      "Sorry to reopen this, but are you sure that using a global counter protected by a lock is actually a real performance issue? Here are some reasons why this might not be as big an issue as it appears:\r\n\r\n* There is a lot of stuff happening in the drivers (our code + user's code). I can't imagine that contention is very likely.\r\n* The lock is extremely short, which further decreases the likelihood of contention.\r\n* A great deal of people use multiple processes in real web apps, that reduces the contention issue even further (though admittedly this doesn't take care of all possible apps).\r\n\r\nI would consider not worrying about this issue unless it actually proves to a problem (unless it already has, in which case I retract my objections)."
