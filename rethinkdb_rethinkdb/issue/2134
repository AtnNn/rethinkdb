        "A long time ago when implementing two-machine replication, in order to prevent costly memory overhead for rows, we decided to only store replication timestamps for the first few rows in a leaf node, under the idea that a replica would only be disconnected for a short amount of time.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should store repli_timestamp_t values for every row.  That will make backfilling do less work and it will make sindex post construction not have to queue writes -- we know which write \"wins\" in the secondary index by seeing which has the later timestamp."
