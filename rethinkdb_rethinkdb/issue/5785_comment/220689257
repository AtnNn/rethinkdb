      "Indeed the `^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ` should underline the failing part of the query. The way we print it obviously breaks down once the queries get longer than a single line.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we could change the formatting for backtraces in the Data Explorer so that it highlights the failing part in bold red or something like that, rather than trying to underline it with `^^^`.\r\n\r\n(additionally there are a few errors that don't generate correct backtraces so the `^` will end up underlining the whole query. This is a separate issue, and doesn't seem to be the case here)\r\n\r\n@tve As a work-around, you might have more luck by copying the error output from the Data Explorer into an editor that doesn't break lines. Then the `^^^` should align with the part of the query that failed."
