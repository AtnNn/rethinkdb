      "I agree that the default should not be `squash: false`. I suspect we'll want to forbid `squash: false` entirely for some types of changefeeds; for example, system table changefeeds always do at least some squashing, even though they ignore the `squash` optarg. There might be other types of changefeeds in the future for which it's impractical to never squash."
