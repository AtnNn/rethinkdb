        "oom bugs should really not be happeneinga ny more? \nsrc/central_freelist.cc:322] tcmalloc: allocation failed 16384 \nrethinkdb: Memory allocation failed. This usually means that we have run out of RAM. Aborting. \n\nI have a 1gb node that randomly crashed. The werid thing is when i tred to change its cache size it would state in the logs the new cache size but would still crash in a matter of minutes or seconds. This is during a backfil. After the crash you see above i had to refll the db but i cant because it keeps crashing\n"
