      "The creator of most of the underlying tools we are using to do this came up with the problem/solution: the Finder used to allow `grid_spacing` values above 100, and the dmgbuild tool defaulted it to 120, but now blows up on those large values. We were not manually setting this, so that took down everything. Changing the value fixes our build.\r\n\r\nThis change, along with updates of all of the included projects to their latest versions, is in CR 2375 from branch `larkost/3253-installer-atwork-on-yosemite`"
