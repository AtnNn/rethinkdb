      "It appears that something has changed in the format for setting the backgrounds on dmg's. At this point I am chasing the problem though the following formats: .DS_Store, binary plists, and the alias format. So far it looks like it is more likely in either .DS_Store or the binary plist formats, but I have not located a meaningful change."
