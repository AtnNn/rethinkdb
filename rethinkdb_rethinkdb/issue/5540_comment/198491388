      "Thanks for the quick response @danielmewes. One of my assumptions here - and I think it's both true and very conservative - is that there will be 1000x as many people who will write software in the future than who do it now. Those people will appreciate clarity and consistency. \r\n\r\nAck re: table.delete() actually deleting documents. Really should be document.delete(). But that's another massive change."
