      "Hi Mike, I agree with you that `delete` is better than `drop` in retrospect.\r\n\r\nI don't necessarily agree that `drop` isn't clear enough for a destructive action. But it's also not as intuitive in my opinion as `tableDelete` or even better `deleteTable`.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's worth changing. But I could be convinced otherwise. We'll see what others think about this.\r\n\r\nNote that there's also https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3130 about changing how dropping a table works. Unfortunately #3130 conflicts a bit with this, since we already have `table.delete()` and it does something quite different from what `table.drop()` would do with #3130."
