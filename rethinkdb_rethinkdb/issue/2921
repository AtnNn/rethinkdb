        "We have a helpful script to uninstall the RethinkDB package, but currently is it just two `rm` statements. We should also run `pkgutil --forget rethinkdb` to remove it from the database of installed packages (after checking that it is there).\n\nFor bonus points we could do two other things:\n1. use `pkgutil --files rethinkdb` to make sure that we are getting everything that was installed (would gracefully handle uninstalling other versions if things changed).\n2. change our identifier from 'rethinkdb' to 'com.rethinkdb' to follow convention.\n"
