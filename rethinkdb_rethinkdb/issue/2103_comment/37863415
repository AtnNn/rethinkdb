      "@mlucy @atnnn I have also updated the Javascript and Python libraries. I haven't tested them however so a buddy check would be a good idea.\r\n\r\nIn all cases I made the new RqlConnectionError descend from whatever was initially raised. This should make this change backwards compatible. (atleast for Ruby/Python, I am not very familiar with Javascript)"
