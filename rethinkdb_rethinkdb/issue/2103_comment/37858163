      "Thanks @josephglanville !  This looks like a reasonable change to me in light of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/468 .  I think we should merge this in, but I want to wait until the same change is made to the other official drivers.\r\n\r\n@atnnn -- @Tryneus is out of town right now, do you think you'd be able to make corresponding changes to the Javascript and Python drivers?"
