      "@coffeemug -- this isn't technically difficult.  We already added some code to distinguish \"normal\" and non-existence (or recoverable) errors.  We could just add some more values to the enum.\r\n\r\nThe real pain is auditing every place in the code where we produce an error, and making sure that it's producing the right one under the new scheme.\r\n\r\nMoving this into 1.14-polish and leaving it assigned to me.  This probably isn't worth holding up the changefeed stuff for, but if I finish that and 1.14 isn't out this would be a reasonable thing to do next."
