      "I like the proposal, but I think we should bump it to 1.13. You know how software is -- getting these in might introduce bugs, which might delay the release, which might entice people to try and get something else in.\r\n\r\nI'd like to branch 1.12.x off next today, would you be opposed to holding this until 1.13? I don't think it's an urgent issue."
