      "This is technically hard to do because our indexes rely on atomic commits to stay consistent with the main data files.\r\nThis is comparably easy if the indexes and the data are in the same file, but much harder if both are in separate files. Not doing this correctly could lead to corrupted data files in case of a crash or power failure."
