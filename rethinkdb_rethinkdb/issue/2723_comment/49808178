      "Just a quick clarification:\r\n>  @danielmewes notes that there have been problems with the Linux kernel drivers for ext4 in the past\r\n\r\nMy comment was more about disk controller drivers in Linux than ext4 specifically. If the system was running on a VM it's totally plausible that the VM wasn't passing data syncs through all the way to the hard drives."
