      "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nFirstly, thank you for the excellent support.\r\n\r\nI can clarify some things here for you.  I am pretty sure this was not caused by any bug of yours.\r\n\r\nThe database was running inside a VM (QEMU).  The host server was subject to substantial power disruption and had to be repaired.\r\nThe host OS was running a writeback cache and I am pretty sure that the cache software reports the write as completed once it hits the cache and not when the data was written to the backing device.\r\n\r\nThe cache is normally non-volatile.  The cache is SSD based - the actual physical disk is on a remote server.\r\n\r\nI described the cache as 'non battery backed' to save a long explanation.  The reality is the SSD device was fried in the power disruption so any data in the cache was lost.\r\n\r\nI do hope this helps clarify things a little."
