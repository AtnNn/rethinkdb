      "Unfortunately this change does not pass our tests on Python2.6 or Python2.7, specifically failing `./test-runner polyglot/datum/string.py` and one other (both for the same reason). From one perspective this is actually uncovering a bug (more exactly a sub-optimal path) in that we have been treating unicode strings in those versions essentially as \"other\" and stuffing them in a Datum. But with this change the `collections.Iterable` test catches them one step earlier and rather tries to turn them into an array.\r\n\r\nLuckily this is an easy fix, just changing line 60 (new version) from:\r\n\r\n```    elif isinstance(val, str):```\r\nto\r\n```    elif isinstance(val, (str, unicode)):```\r\n\r\nWe already have the coverage to make `unicode = str` above to handle Python3.x cases.\r\n\r\n@grandquista could you make that change and resubmit?"
