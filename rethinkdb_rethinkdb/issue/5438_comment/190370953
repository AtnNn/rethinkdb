      "Thanks so much for working on a test case and sharing it with us @tatsujin1 . That is *extremely* helpful.\r\n\r\nThe one thing we changed about changefeeds in 2.2.5 is https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5205 , so I suspect that this is related. Though we'll still need to understand why it sometimes also happened with 2.2.3. Maybe the cause is the same, but the change in 2.2.5 makes it easier to hit?\r\n\r\n@mlucy can you look into this please?"
