      "I've now tried the map-to-json thingy, but nothing happened. Ran through all tables without a hitch. The biggest table is actually ~400k documents, but there's almost no reads there; it's basically a log.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've applied the core size limit (also to the running processes), so I hope we'll get a core next time around. It does seem to happen at least daily.\r\n"
