      "Of course it crashed again ~14:30, you could almost set a watch by these crashes...\r\nThe query logs contains the same similar standard queries; mostly `get()`, `get_all()`, slightly fewer `update()`, `delete()` and the occasional `insert()`...\r\n\r\nI also did a `top -b -d 1` before (and during) the crash; cpu load was regular ups & downs throughout. The 1-minute average system load climed during the last 3 minutes from 0.1 to 0.5. But then again, it is within normal fluctuations.\r\n\r\nOur best correlation so far is that the times kind of coincide with coffee breaks. ;)\r\n"
