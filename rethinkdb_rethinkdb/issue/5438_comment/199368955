      "@danielmewes, can you send me the prebuild package to gngeorgiev.it@gmail.com, I discovered that the changefeeds break the same way in my case with rethink 2.2.5. I need at least ubuntu 14 and maybe a arch linux build. This is highly appreciated since this is huge blocker :relieved: \r\n\r\nEdit: sorry, just saw that the fix is in next, will try to build from source first\r\n\r\nEdit2: I can confirm that the issue is resolved in the upcoming version of rethinkdb - 2.2.6"
