      "@tatsujin1 This will be in RethinkDB 2.2.6, but it might take us two weeks or so to get out. Since you're running into this frequently, I can send you a pre-release package based on 2.2.5 with the patch applied. Could you drop me a quick email to daniel@rethinkdb.com ?\r\n\r\n@jodagm could you send me a short email as well please? You're running Ubuntu Wily right?"
