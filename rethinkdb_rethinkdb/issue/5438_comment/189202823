      "Indeed it crashed as expected, promptly at 09:37... almost like clockwork.\r\nI have logs from all but one process, which is a read-only nodejs server, which I - for now - assume is not contributing to the crash. Monkey-patching javascript is not my fort\233...\r\n\r\nThere are no obvious queries that stand out; nothing that also happen about every other second...\r\nI think we'll wait for the 14:30 crash and compare the logs."
