      "> I've now tried the map-to-json thingy, but nothing happened. Ran through all tables without a hitch.\r\n\r\nThat sounds like the stored data is ok then.\r\n\r\nSo it's probably some query that triggers this. I wish we had a query log to debug things like this, but unfortunately we don't have that yet. :-(\r\n\r\nI realize that this might be a lot of work, so we can think of some other options for debugging this if it's too difficult: Is it easily possible in your application to add some form of query log on the application side? I.e. whenever you call `run`, write the query itself into a log file together with the current date and time? (you should be able to convert the query object that you call `run` on to a string)\r\nThat could give us some hints as to what's triggering the crash."
