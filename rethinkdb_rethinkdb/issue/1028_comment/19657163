      "Should the web ui just report the error, or should it also solve it?\r\nShould we let users set a new auth key on the web ui too?\r\n\r\nIn term of work:\r\n- Properly displaying the issue shouldn't be really hard.\r\n- Solve the issue is probably fine too\r\n- Letting users set the auth key isn't hard in itself, but the question is where to put it. I would tend to put it with the update options, but that probably means we will need a full view and not just a slider, which can be some \r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, we don't have a flag to set the auth key (or maybe with the `--config-file flag`?), so only the CLI can do it. If it's an expected behavior, I would tend to think that it's fine to not let users set a new auth key in the web ui.\r\n\r\nping @Tryneus @coffeemug "
