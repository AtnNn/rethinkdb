      "@Tryneus looked into it, and it looks like it's the script `conflict-util.py` just doesn't work on my laptop. It works fine on newton.\r\n\r\nI just tested again the auth key conflict. The resolution works fine.\r\nI also tested other vector clock conflict, and everything seems to work fine too.\r\n\r\nReview 686 assigned to @mglukhovsky \r\nBranch michel_1028_auth_key\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky if we can ship this for 1.7, it would be pretty nice."
