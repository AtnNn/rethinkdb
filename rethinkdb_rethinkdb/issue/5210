        "If I set includeInitial:true and includeStates:true, and do a changefeed query, is it guaranteed -- when iterating through the values -- to get either an error or to see {state:'ready'} at some point?.    I'm looking at https://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/changes/ .    I ask, because I assumed this in my now live production code, and it is failing randomly maybe 3-5% of the time.    \r\n\r\nI just tried waiting 15 minutes, then modifying what the query would get, and then suddenly got the {state:'ready'}.     \r\n\r\nSo if the API doesn't guarantee {state:'ready'} without further changes, please clarify.  That would be odd, since it would make this useless.   Otherwise, I think there is a **very** serious bug that is sporadically hit in production.\r\n\r\nNOTE: the queries I'm seeing this with are very simple -- just `.getAll(['one key']).pluck(some fields)`  -- nothing complicated at all.    (Literally, it is this: `db.table('projects').getAll(@project_id).pluck('project_id', 'host', 'state', 'storage', 'storage_request')`)\r\n\r\nI'm using RethinkDB 2.2.1 on Ubuntu 15.04.  "
