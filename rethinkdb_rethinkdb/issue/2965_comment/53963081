      "GNU Make doesn't reconsider files correctly when there are multiple targets in a single rule, such as when `protoc` generates both the C++ source and header file in a single invocation.\r\n\r\nI found that asking make to delete the `*.pb.*` files before regenerating them fixes the count. The fix is in review 2044."
