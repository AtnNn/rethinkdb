        "Hello,\r\n\r\nI couldn't find any feasible solution to this, so I'm opening a feature request.\r\n\r\nMany ReQL functions operates on \"singleSelection\", and, as far as I know, only \"get\" returns this type of data. But what if one needs to lookup for a single document based on a predicate that include primary key among other values? So I suggest:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable.filterOne(predicate) \8594 singleRowSelection\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, the filter could potentially return more then one document, in this case, the first one should be used. (An 'options' argument could define a sorting config)\r\n\r\nSo, one could do:\r\n```javascript\r\nr.filterOne({ id: 1, status: \"ACTIVE\" }).update({\r\n    list: r.row(\"list\").setInsert(\"value\")\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n```javascript\r\nr.get(1).update(function(x) {\r\n    return r.branch(\r\n        x(\"status\").eq(\"ACTIVE\"),\r\n        { list: x(\"list\").setInsert(\"value\") },\r\n        {});\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr maybe, someone could enlight me with a better solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
