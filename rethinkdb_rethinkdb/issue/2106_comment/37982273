      "> RqlDriverError does not mean much to me. What errors could the driver have? serialization/deserialization issues? What else?\r\n\r\nA misbehaving driver can do a lot of things wrong that are detected on the server.  A few off the top of my head:\r\n* It can behave incorrectly during the handshake.\r\n* It can send malformed protobufs.\r\n* It can send correct protobufs with nonsense semantics (e.g. it can send functions that reference variables which don't exist).\r\n* It can send CONTINUE queries for tokens that don't exist.\r\n\r\nBasically \"RqlDriverError\" means \"contact your driver maintainer\"."
