      "> Side Note: With Ruby Term::TermType::UPDATE is in the global namespace. It should belong in the RethinkDB namespace. Because the class Term is global, the user cannot have his own class Term and that's a little sad.\r\n\r\nWe should definitely move the `require`s inside the RethinkDB module if that would fix this.  I'm currently making some changes to the Ruby driver in a branch; I'll do that while I'm in there."
