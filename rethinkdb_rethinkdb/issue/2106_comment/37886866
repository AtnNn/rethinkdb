      "To chime in:\r\n\r\nI see 4 possible error conditions:\r\n1. Network/connection related, i.e ECONNREFUSED (retry-able)\r\n2. Server errors/bugs (non-retry-able)\r\n3. User error (non-retry-able)\r\n4. Cluster state errors (retry-able)\r\n\r\nI think each of these classes of errors need to be distinguishable.\r\nThe difference between 2 and 4 should be one of state, 2 means state had nothing to do with why your query failed, the server is just buggy and you should file a bug report. 4 would be that the cluster is either unhealthy or a state related error caused your query to fail. Something like the master being down so your table is unwritable or another blueprint/goal related error."
