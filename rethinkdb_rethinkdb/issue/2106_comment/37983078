      "> It can behave incorrectly during the handshake.\r\n\r\nI'd stay that this lands in a ParsingError category (maybe ProtocolError would be a better name?).\r\n\r\n> It can send malformed protobufs.\r\n\r\nThat's a server concern: the received query cannot be parsed/compiled.\r\n\r\n> It can send correct protobufs with nonsense semantics\r\n\r\nThat's more of a server concern: the received query makes no sense. That's a QueryCompile error.\r\n\r\n> It can send CONTINUE queries for tokens that don't exist.\r\n\r\nProtocolError?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI see what you mean by DriverError means \"contact your driver maintainer\" (with the exception of nonsensical queries)."
