      "hi Daniel\r\nno, I don't feel I can use between, because what I'm trying to do needs to be stateless and I won't have anywhere (and can't expect the client to) to store min_id between between() calls..\r\n\r\nI can confirm though that this is directly related to my document size - performance on a more smaller document size is 1.6 secs for slice(100000,101000) and 3.1 secs for slice(100000,101000) ..\r\n\r\nSo in my use case my final document size will be smaller than I've been testing with so either skip() or slice() will probably be ok."
