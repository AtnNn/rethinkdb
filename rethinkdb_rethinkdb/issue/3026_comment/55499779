      "One reason for why automatically coercing *from* GeoJSON to pseudo<GEOMETRY> would be bad is that RethinkDB only supports a subset of GeoJSON. Putting a GeoJSON object we don't recognize into a table with a geo index on it would fail to add the object to the index, without a way to tell the user that the document could not be indexed and why.\r\nHaving to call r.geoJson() explicitly provides a single and well defined point of failure for illegal/unsupported GeoJSON data."
