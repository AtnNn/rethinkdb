      "Yeah, I forgot the `run` (just updated the comment).\r\n\r\nHow do we have the same behavior with dates in JS?  Do we just discard the timezone?  If so, that seems sort of bad -- we don't do that in Ruby or Python.  We might want to consider returning a type that inherits from the JS date/time type but has timezone information attached so that we can preserve that property."
