      "I'm not sure we want to blur the line between normal objects and pseudotypes like that.  I could imagine it being really confusing for people.\r\n\r\nI think `r.table('test').insert(r.table('test').get(1).run(), conflict:'replace')` should always always always be a no-op.  I don't think it's good enough to let people retrieve a pseudotype and insert an object, even if that object gets automatically converted to the pseudotype in geo operations.  There will be other subtle differences (such as sorting order) that will confuse the heck out of people.\r\n\r\nIt would be slightly less bad to not have a geo pseudotype at all, and have geo operations take objects that are assumed to be legal geoJSON objects.  But that seems like a really big change to make at this point."
