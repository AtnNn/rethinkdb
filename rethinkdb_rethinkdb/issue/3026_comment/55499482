      "Automatically coercing to geojson would be confusing because geo indexes only index GEOMETRY pseudo type objects, but not other things that happen to look like GeoJSON. So it would be very confusing for people why some objects are being indexed and others are not.\r\n\r\nGetting rid of the GEOMETRY pseudotype alltogether and instead trying to interpret objects as GeoJSON whenever applying a geospatial operation (or inserting into a geo index) would be slightly better in my opinion, but still has a bad smell to me."
