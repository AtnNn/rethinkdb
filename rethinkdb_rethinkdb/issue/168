An \"unreachable node\" issue pops up. Declare the second node dead in the browser. Restart the second node. \"Zombie machine\" issue pops up as expected.\n\nTest 2: point the browser at the second node, then kill the first node. An \"unreachable node\" issue pops up. Declare the first node dead in the browser. Restard the first node. Everything continues to work and no \"zombie machine\" issue pops up.\n\nExpected behavior: \"zombie machine\" issue should pop up in the second test, but it does not.\n"
