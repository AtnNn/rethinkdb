      "I actually think @neumino is right: join table x with table y on condition/predicate. For eqJoin the predicate is:\r\nwhere left.attribute == right.id, but we chose to use a shortcut for that. It doesn't change though the meaning.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the discussion of having joins as prefix operation would make this even more obvious that the field_name should come last."
