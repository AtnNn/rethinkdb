      "Thanks for the issue report @erikdubbelboer . This is a stack overflow caused by the deep nesting depth during JSON parsing.\r\n\r\nWe'll look into it, but I recommend changing the data layout in the meantime. In general extremely deeply nested JSON data like this one is likely to hit badly tested edge cases both in terms of resource consumption as well as performance."
