      "@danielmewes we changed our object so this isn't an issue anymore.\r\n\r\nI thought a mature database like rethinkdb would at least have some tests with random objects of random depths and would fail gracefully when something was wrong. A simple object like this crashing the whole database seems like a big bug to me."
