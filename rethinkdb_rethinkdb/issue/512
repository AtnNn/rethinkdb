        "The config file contains options that are passed to the daemonizer (options such as `runuser` and `rungroup`), which RethinkDB knows nothing about. The old (boost) config file parser ignored them, while the new one throws an error when it sees one it doesn't recognize. It needs to not throw, because it causes problems for users who use rethink with `init.d`.\n"
