      "FYI, in the new protobuf spec, such arguments are not required fields. Every operation takes an arbitrary number of arguments and it is up to the server to error if the arguments are not of the correct number or type. While not yet implemented, the current idea is that all positional arguments are required and will produce a type error if missing while optional arguments are, well, optional. Therefore to implement your suggestion Slava we would have to make the mapping field of a map be an optional argument with a default of the identity function. This would look rather weird though to people reading the spec. Fortunately, I don't think it should be necessary. If this same query (`r([1,2]).map().run()`) were run with the new protobuf spec the server would respond with a type error (e.g. `TypeError: no mapping function argument provided to map call`). This is nice as it moves type and argument checking into the server will all drivers will benefit and the errors will be consistent."
