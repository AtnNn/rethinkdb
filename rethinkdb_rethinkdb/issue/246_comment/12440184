      "It also depends on how the driver is implemented. The Python driver currently does not check number or types of arguments as a matter of convenience though it could be made to. While client side checks would be nice, it's still important to have the server return clear messages for all the drivers that don't choose to implement error checking (or are buggy, see the current JS driver which nominally checks argument types)."
