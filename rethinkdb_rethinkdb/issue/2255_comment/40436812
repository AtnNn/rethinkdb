      "Sorry -- one more test. Could you create a directory inside the shared folder and try placing `rethinkdb_data` there? I.e. instead of `shared_folder/rethinkdb_data` could you set it up via `shared_folder/dummy/rethinkdb_data`?\r\n\r\nVirtualBox might not support fsync on the actual shared folder, but I'd like to see if it works with a dummy folder inside.\r\n\r\nAlso one more question -- what is the exact command you're running that causes this stack trace?"
