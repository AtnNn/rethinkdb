        "The current `extproc_pool_t` is created with a maximum number of workers based on the number of threads:\n\n`src/clustering/administration/main/serve.cc`:\n\n``` c\nextproc_pool_t extproc_pool(get_num_threads());\n```\n\nSince we are adding `r.http`, which may involve long-running queries, we should:\n1. increase the limit of extprocs\n2. add extproc deallocation window for when many extprocs are unused\n\nThis will be especially useful for when we add more parallelization in the query layer, and a single query may be running multiple extproc terms at the same time.\n"
