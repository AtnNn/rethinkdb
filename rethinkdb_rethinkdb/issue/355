        "We need to notify users about software updates because RethinkDB is evolving very quickly, and because of potentially critical integrity and security updates. Here's how I propose to do it:\r\n\r\n1. When the user first opens the admin UI in the browser, present them with a popover that explains why we do automatic updates (possibly with a link to an FAQ section), a checkbox that says \"automatically check for version updates\" and an \"Ok\" button. There is a question of where to store this info (e.g. cookie, semilattice metadata, both and use a conservative approach, etc. -- this remains to be decided)\r\n2. Have a little gears icon on the toolbar that the user can click on, which would allow them to turn this off at any time (eventually this will have more settings)\r\n3. If the notifications are turned on, every time the user first opens the web UI, do an ajax call to updates.rethinkdb.com and get the latest available version. If the latest version is newer than the one the user is running, present them with a popover that advises them to upgrade.\r\n4. The updates.rethinkdb.com server should send back to the client the latest version, and should contain a message that explains how to turn off the autoupdate feature (in case someone traps it via a firewall, they'll know what it's for and how to turn it off)\r\n5. The client should send the server no more information than absolutely necessary, and we should explicitly explain the FAQ which bits of information we send."
