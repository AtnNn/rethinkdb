The following works fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table('groups').update({state: 'found'}).run(conn, callback);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut doing the same thing with expr gives error: Expected type SELECTION but found DATUM \r\n \r\n```\r\ngroups = [\r\n    {userIds: [1, 2, 3], state: 'searching'},\r\n    {userIds: [4, 5], state: 'searching'}\r\n]\r\nr.expr(groups).update({state: 'found'}).run(conn, callback);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny idea what I'm doing wrong?
