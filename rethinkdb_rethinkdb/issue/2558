The following works fine:\n\n```\nr.table('groups').update({state: 'found'}).run(conn, callback);\n```\n\nBut doing the same thing with expr gives error: Expected type SELECTION but found DATUM \n\n```\ngroups = [\n    {userIds: [1, 2, 3], state: 'searching'},\n    {userIds: [4, 5], state: 'searching'}\n]\nr.expr(groups).update({state: 'found'}).run(conn, callback);\n```\n\nAny idea what I'm doing wrong? \n"
