      "1 and 2 sound good to me.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit sceptical about adding specific feature detection scripts to `configure`, because it adds maintenance overhead in the future. I feel like the next time we have to test for a new feature, we would resort to one of the pre-existing compiler/platform macros again because it's less work.\r\n\r\nI haven't heard of `_Pragma` before. How exactly is that different from `#pragma`?"
