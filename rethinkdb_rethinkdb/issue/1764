        "If you have a record missing the Field for the left table join ID, then the query will fail \n\n``` javascript\nr.db(\"user1\").table(\"others\").eqJoin(\"contact_id\",   r.db(\"user1\").table(\"contacts\"))\n```\n\nGives: \"RqlRuntimeError: No attribute `contact_id` in object\" when any document doesn't have a Field of `contact_id`\n\nThis can be avoided by doing the following:\n\n``` javascript\n r.db(\"user1\").table(\"others\").filter(function(user) {\n    return user.hasFields('contact_id')\n}).eqJoin(\"contact_id\",   r.db(\"user1\").table(\"contacts\"))\n```\n\nBut this seems wrong ... I shouldn't really have to guard all join queries like this \n\nIn SQL doing a JOIN with a NULL key would just not include that record, and for all intents and purposes in a document database, a missing field would be the equivalent of NULL (at least I would always treat it that way in my application rather than raise an exception when a field wasn't present (unless that field was absolutely critical to the application and it's exclusion would have indicated a data integrity was broken)\n\nCan I suggest that this be discussed and possibly changed to be more in line with principle of least surprise, by making Rethink exclude rows where there is no join key available?\n"
