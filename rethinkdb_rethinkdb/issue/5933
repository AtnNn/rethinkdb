        "Hey RethinkDB team,\n\n**This is really a serious issue**. I am using rethinkdb database for my new project. I created a database it was working perfect, but suddenly the next day when i was trying to connect to database it gave me error  **Database `database_name` does not exist in:  r.db(\"database_name\").table(\"table_name\").get(id)** \n\nAt a moment I thought I wrote wrong query so I went and checked the query through web interface and I was surprised to see the database that i created didn't exist.. The entire database was lost.. all the tables created and all the data in it is gone..!! I remember that I have never dropped the database, I have even checked the log but the log showed all the entries of the current day. I have no idea why this happened. Thank god that I found this before I put this into production.\n"
