      "An upstart job would certainly be helpful for some end users.\r\n\r\nWe considered using upstart, limiting the init job to a single instance, hard-coding parameters into the init script, automatically creating new users and groups during install, and having the server add a job for itself at installation, but we decided not to take these routes for various reasons.\r\n\r\n* We need to support a number of platforms other than Ubuntu, and we wanted to have a single start job framework, at least at this stage.\r\n* We had a number of usage scenarios that required multiple server instances.\r\n* The init script is not quite complete and thus subject to large changes. We thought that it would be bad for the end user to need to perform a merge during software updates.\r\n* Many people are just trying the server executable at this point and do not necessarily need us to create users and server instances for them.\r\n* The product is not quite to the point at which it would be considered safe enough to enable itself automatically on install, and it would be bad if we added a step to the average user's installation to remove the init/upstart job.\r\n\r\nWhen the product matures to the point at which a lot of users would be using it in production, we might add a compatible upstart script. Our packaging workflow can distinguish a non-portable Ubuntu build from a portable Ubuntu build (which must work on Debian) or a Debian build, so we would be able to package it quite easily.\r\n\r\nUPDATE_ALTERNATIVES is 0 in most build scenarios.\r\n"
