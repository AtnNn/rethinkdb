      "@VeXocide I think we would probably not have a separate function, but have it part of the index function. Unless there's a good reason for having it separate.\r\n\r\nYou can already do this with something like\r\n`function (x) { return r.branch(predicate(x), x('field'), null) }`\r\n\r\nWith this proposal that would become\r\n`function (x) { return r.branch(predicate(x), x('field'), r.absent) }`\r\n\r\nI think that's nicer than a second function because it's more generic and doesn't add another argument to `indexCreate`. I might be wrong of course."
