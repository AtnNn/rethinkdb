      "Another reason I think the value for this should be `undefined`/`r.absent` is because it would make the behavior of simple indexes in the absence of a field that much more predictable/straightforward to reason about. (`absent` being a suggestion from https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1032#issuecomment-31983951)\r\n\r\nAlso, `absent` makes sense for use in *querying* as well, both for getting the set of all rows that *do not have a value for an index* (like https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1032#issuecomment-19591031 described for `null` back when `null` had the semantics of this proposed value), or for (possibly future use) more complex query/filter expressions where all documents that do have a field should be excluded (could be inverted and rewritten to `not(hasFields())` by the driver or implementation)."
