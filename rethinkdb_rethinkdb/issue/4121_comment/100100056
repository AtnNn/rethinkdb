      "This is a very interesting idea to me. It seems to me that a value of `r.absent` might also serve to remove a key from a record: `.update({foo: r.absent})` instead of `.replace(r.row.without('foo'))`? If this were the case, such a value would have to be distinct from the language's concept of `undefined`."
