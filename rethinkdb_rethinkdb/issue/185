        "Our original reasoning to require `.run()` at the end of data explorer queries was that people should be able to copy/paste queries into their code. However, there are a few problems with that reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. The use case of playing with data explorer for exploration is the most prevalent now, and will remain very important for the foreseeable future. We shouldn't make this more difficult in order to enforce copy-pastability of the code.\r\n2. For node.js the code isn't copy-pastable anyway because a) the data explorer provides its own async handlers, and b) the data explorer deals with the cursor. When we write code in node, we can't just copy-paste queries from the data explorer.\r\n\r\nWe should make `.run()` in the data explorer optional."
