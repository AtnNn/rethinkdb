      "Pro accepting all opt args:\r\n* backwards compatibility for Ruby and Python\r\n* no arbitrary distinction (e.g. `durability`)\r\n* more flexbility when writing queries (can also save some typing)\r\n\r\nContra accepting all opt args:\r\n* really easy to forget adding a new opt arg to the list in the future\r\n* having to specify opt args at the term where they are being used makes sure people understand which terms a given opt arg has effects on"
