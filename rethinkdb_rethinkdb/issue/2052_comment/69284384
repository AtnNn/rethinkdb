      "> If we do this, we should make the optargspec_t constructor guarantee that the optarg is in the global list. That way we'd get a crash the first time we tried to test a term using the new optarg.\r\n\r\nAh that's a good idea.\r\nWith that out of the way, I'm leaning towards having all opt args that are allowed somewhere to also be allowed globally."
