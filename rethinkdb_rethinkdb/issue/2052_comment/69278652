      "Sorry to resurrect a dead horse, but re-opening briefly to talk about the set of accepted global optargs.\r\n\r\nThe linked patch makes some global optargs which are currently accepted illegal.  I'm not *necessarily* opposed to doing this, but it seems like a bad idea on the surface: it might break somebody's app and there's no real cost to accepting them.  I could very easily see someone wanting to specify e.g. `geo_system` globally.  It also seems strange that for some terms we now accept some but not all of their optargs at the global level.  For example, you can set `durability` at the top level, but not `non_atomic`.  I can imagine that being confusing."
