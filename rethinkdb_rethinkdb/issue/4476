        "Hey guys, I'm working integrating RethinkDB with Meteor. \n- [driver](https://github.com/ccorcos/meteor-rethink)\n- [example](https://github.com/ccorcos/meteor-any-db/tree/master/examples/rethink)\n\nI'm having some issue with change feeds though. I need to be able to implement [`cursor.observerChanges`](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/observe_changes) based on the changefeed but I'm running into two roadblocks:\n\n1) Rethink doesn't consistently provide the initial documents. In fact, the documentation is explicitly vague about this inconsistency:\n\n> Point changefeeds will always return initial values and have an initializing state; feeds that return changes on unfiltered tables will never return initial values. Feeds that return changes on more complex queries may or may not return return initial values, depending on the kind of aggregation.\n\n2) They don't support movement in ordered queries. When a document changes position in an ordered query, I would expect the changefeed to reflect that.\n\nIf we can solve these two issues, integrating rethinkdb with Meteor will be a breeze!\n"
