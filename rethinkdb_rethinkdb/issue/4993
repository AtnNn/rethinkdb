        "I haven't encountered this issue my self, relaying Williamsteins description from slack:\n\nwilliamstein [7:17 PM] \n@dalanmiller: on Iphone 6+, the RethinkDb website, docs, etc., are perhaps the most horrendously broken website I've seen on mobile.  This slowed my adoption of RethinkDB for a while (e.g., a few times, I heard about it when reading something on my phone, looked at the site, it was impossible to read, so I went elsewhere).   What happens when viewing the site in iPhone 6+ is that something gets in a weird infinite loop where it changes the layout, then changes it again about 1 second later, then in response to that change, it changes it back, ad infinitum.      I imagined this problem would be quickly fixed, but I just checked and it is still broken (6 months later).    With Safari it changes the layout about once per second; with Chrome (on iOS) it changes layout back and forth about 8 times per second (so same problem, but worse).\n\nI tested the api-docs using iphone 6, but couldn't reproduce the issue. I don't have 6+ available, so I cant test that.\n"
