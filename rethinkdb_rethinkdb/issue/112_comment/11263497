      "Outdated here means you're not guaranteed to see your own write. For example in the absence of other queries right now if I have a clean table and I do:\r\n\r\n    table.insert(\"foo\").run()\r\n    table.count().run()\r\n\r\nThe count is guaranteed to return `1`. I think it's good that every query we have is read-your-own-write so we shouldn't get rid of this. Also it's very possible to make this work in an up-to-date way which would be pretty cool.\r\n\r\nBasically this the type of thing we'll need to build an optimizer for since we basically have a command evaluated differently depending on what it's applied to. In this case `count`.\r\n\r\nDoing things per shard is only possible to approximate right now, or you can do a full scan."
