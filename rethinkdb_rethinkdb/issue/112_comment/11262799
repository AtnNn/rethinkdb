      "The one we really need to be constant time is r.table('foo').count(). It's cool if it's outdated (though we should probably discuss what \"outdated\" means here). It would also be really nice to get constant time count-like query per shard, but I don't believe it's possible, is it? (mainly, how to do it when two shards share a btree?)\r\n\r\n"
