      "> Outdated here means you're not guaranteed to see your own write.\r\n\r\nAgreed that this is bad, but why is this the case? I don't see why this limitation is necessary.\r\n\r\n> Basically this the type of thing we'll need to build an optimizer for since we basically have a command evaluated differently depending on what it's applied to.\r\n\r\nRight, but in this case it's very, very simple (i.e. if you're running `count` on a table, use one codepath, otherwise use another).\r\n\r\n> Doing things per shard is only possible to approximate right now\r\n\r\nCould you explain why this is the case? Are virtual shards the only culprits here?"
