      "It's not necessary but it's a bit of work to get rid of it. Basically to get rid of this limitation we're going to need to add a second fifo. We have one guarding the superblock we're also going to add an identical one for the statblock and then the limitation goes away.\r\n\r\n    Right, but in this case it's very, very simple (i.e. if you're running count on a table, use one codepath, otherwise use another).\r\n\r\nRight I'm just saying we should recognize this for what it is and not do it in a hacky way because I suspect there are a number of things like this we're going to want to do.\r\n\r\nVirtual shards are the only culprit here but there isn't really a good way around that. We don't want to let the abstraction of the shards to break because it's very important to our performance to have the freedom it entails."
