      "This is another case of us using too much memory. It's not really a bug, apart from the fact that the debug-only coroutine limit is too strict.\r\n\r\nI think we should make the coro limit just print a warning, rather than terminate the server.\r\n\r\nI'll also look into why we are spawning so many coroutines."
