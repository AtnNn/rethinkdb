      "I hope I finally have a fix in code review 1883 (branch `daniel_2211_nocoro_registrar`).\r\n\r\nWhether the problem is actually completely fixed is a bit difficult to test because the test still regularly fails for other reasons (test timeouts, heartbeat timeouts #2763, a different crash #2810). I didn't get any \"too many coroutines\" failures during 16 runs, while it was the most prominent way of failing for this test before."
