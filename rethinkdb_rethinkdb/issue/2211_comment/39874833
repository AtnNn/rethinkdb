      "@coffeemug Yes.\r\nOne of the advantage of throttling the number of backfills is that individual backfills finish faster and in case of an interruption don't have to be redone when the node comes back up. A solution to #1944 would take away that advantage of throttling (because backfills would be resumable).\r\nThe remaining advantages of throttling (lower memory consumption, faster mean time to availability of replicas as @srh pointed out) would remain.\r\n\r\nIt's also compatible with the currently considered solutions to #1944. If we implement the solution to #1944 described by @timmaxw here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2002#issuecomment-36312765 , that would not change anything about throttling at all."
