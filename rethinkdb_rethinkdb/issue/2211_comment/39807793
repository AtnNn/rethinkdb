      "Might it make sense to limit it to less than that?  Might it also make sense to limit it to 2 incoming backfills per peer?  The reason would be the general sort of advantage you get from batching jobs instead of running them all in parallel (without any speedup thanks to parallelism): some of them finish early, even if it takes the same amount of time to do all of them.  The result would be: some replicas are live quicker, and these live replicas no longer have write queues to maintain."
