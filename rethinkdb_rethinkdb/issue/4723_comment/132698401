      "@veigarfreyr, @cd34 Thanks for the report, and sorry you're running into this. We'll look into this and try to provide a fix asap.\r\n\r\n@veigarfreyr Could you email me the output of `r.db('rethinkdb').table('_debug_table_status')` (this can be pretty large), as well as the output of `r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_status')` and `r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_config')`? My email is daniel@rethinkdb.com . This data would help a lot in figuring out what's going on.\r\n\r\nIs there a chance you could provide us with a copy of the data directories as well? We can sign an NDA if necessary. If yes, please let me know and we will send you instructions for the data upload."
