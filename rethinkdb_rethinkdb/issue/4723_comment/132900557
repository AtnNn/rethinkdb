      "Thanks a lot @cd34 . We took a look at your server configuration and think that we understand how this happened.\r\nWe're going to include a fix for this in 2.1.2.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this is basically a side-effect of a migration bug that existed in 2.1.0, but was fixed in 2.1.1. However it seems like the new code in 2.1.1 that works around tables that were already affected by the bug has the side-effect of never making the tables appear as ready. There are still some open questions and we're still investigating the details of this."
