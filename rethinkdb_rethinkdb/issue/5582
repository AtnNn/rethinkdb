        "When running `./test/run changefeeds.change_master` I am seeing an occasional timeout failure on a `table.wait` for a table where the master and replica have only been switched. The timeout is set for 20 seconds, and there should be no backfilling necessary as this is only a swap in rolls on one of the two shards on the table. I am only seeing this occasionally, so far only when there are other tests running. The timeout is on [line 72](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/test/changefeeds/change_master.test#L72). This has mostly been locally on my Macs, but I worry that this is exposing some sort of race condition."
