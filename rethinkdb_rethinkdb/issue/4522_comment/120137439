      "Unfortunately, `r.table(x).info().default({..})` won't work where x is an ambiguous table name or doesn't exist. So it's impossible to compose into a larger query. The only work-around is to split out the sub-queries that use `.info` and `.indexList` into their own queries because there is no way to recover from that error in reql currently."
