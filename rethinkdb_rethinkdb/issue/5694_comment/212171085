      "Since I worked on #5647 \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about doing \r\n\r\n```python\r\nis_fileobj = hasattr(options[\"out_file\"], 'write')`\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of making unnecessarily complex code to work with both Python 3 and Python 2? Since in Python 3, you'd have to do `isinstance(options[\"out_file\"], io.IOBase)` --but that'd fail in Python 2.\r\n\r\nI think it's still readable and gets the point across."
