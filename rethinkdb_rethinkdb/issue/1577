        "`r.connect` in the JavaScript currently has two syntaxes:\n\n``` js\nr.connect( \"localhost\", function(error, connection) { ... } )\nr.connect( { host: \"localhost\", authKey: \"...\", .. }, function(error, connection) { ... } )\n```\n\nIf no one has strong objection, I would like to remove the first one. That way we would have the same syntax across the three drivers and that would make the driver a little less complex.\nNote that you cannot pass a string like `\"localhost:28015\"` or anything else. Nothing is parsed.\n\nThe check on line 403 is not safe too (for the type of `host`)\n\nIf `host` is `null`, no error is thrown there, but one is thrown because we try to read the property `host` of `null` (line 72)\n\n```\n> r.connect(null, function(e, c) { } )\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'host' of null\n    at TcpConnection.Connection (/usr/lib/node_modules/rethinkdb/net.js:107:21)\n    at new TcpConnection (/usr/lib/node_modules/rethinkdb/net.js:379:41)\n```\n\nIf `host` is an `array`, no error are thrown, and the result is like passing an empty object.\n\nIf `host` is `undefined`, an error will be thrown on line 403, which make the test on line 67 useless.\n"
