        "Right now the server will crash if you try to create a sindex that uses javascript to compute its values. This is because the sindex function is evaluated using a very crippled `env_t`. We need to have tests for these types of sindex functions and also not crash when we get them.\r\n\r\nOn another note it might be really nice to officially introduce the concept of a `limited_env_t` (or maybe `deterministic_env_t`) that doesn't give you fancy stuff like javascript and access to other tables since there are a few places we use such an object (mutation operations are another big one). It could really just be another constructor on `env_t` but I think having this concept could help our collective understanding of what operations can be done where."
