      "@danielmewes Disk space is fine on both machines.  Both machines are running ontop of BTRFS, I have had no issues in the past so I'm not sure it's related to the filesystem in this case.  I was setting up replication between the main server running debian, 3.12kernel to a fedora 20 running 3.13kernel, both on BTRFS.  "
