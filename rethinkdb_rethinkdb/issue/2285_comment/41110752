      "@crosbymichael Thanks for checking. We have not done heavy testing on BTRFS, so that could in theory have something to do with it. I'll set up a BTRFS partition and try to reproduce it locally.\r\nA few more questions:\r\nWhat size are the documents approximately?\r\nHow many nodes do you have in your cluster?\r\nIs the table sharded? If yes, how many shards?\r\nWhat exactly did you change to trigger the backfilling (increased number of replicas, brought a disconnected node back up, resharded?)?\r\nWere other queries going on during the backfilling?\r\n\r\n\r\n#2237 still seems to be the most likely explanation at this point, so the problem could just go away with 1.12.4."
