      "@philips thank you for the update.\r\nI'll double-check what could cause these intrusive list errors in these places.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the crashes still happened after upgrading to 1.12.4 indicates that this might be totally different from #2237 (unless #2237 somehow lead to corrupted data being written to disk while running 1.12.3, but that seems unlikely)."
