      "@crosbymichael @philips Do you still have the data files from a crashing node? If yes, can you send them to us for further inspection? They often compress very well (with gzip or the like), and it might be possible to put them in an email (daniel@rethinkdb.com). If they are too large, we can arrange for an upload page where you can securely upload the data."
