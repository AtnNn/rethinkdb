      "The problem seems to be related to gzip or deflate compression.\r\n\r\nIf I disable it by removing the line\r\n```c++\r\nexc_setopt(curl_handle, CURLOPT_ENCODING, \"deflate;q=1, gzip;q=0.5\", \"PROTOCOLS\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom our code, it works fine. It looks like curl doesn't decompress the data on Windows. Maybe it's related to how we compile it?\r\n\r\nWe could disable compression for `r.http` on Windows until we figure this out."
