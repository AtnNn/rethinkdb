        "Upon reading through the docs, I stumbled upon the *Scaling considerations* section on [the changefeed page](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/changefeeds/javascript/):\r\n\r\n> Since changefeeds are unidirectional with no acknowledgement returned from clients, they cannot guarantee delivery. If you need real-time updating with delivery guarantees, consider using a model that distributes to the clients through a message broker such as [RabbitMQ](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/rabbitmq/javascript/).\r\n\r\nThe RabbitMQ link forwarded me to the [RabbitMQ integration page](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/rabbitmq/javascript/). There I noticed, that this example script (let's call it adapter script) is also using changefeeds:\r\n\r\n> RethinkDB supports changefeeds, which allow you to subscribe to changes on a table. The database pushes these changes to you as they happen. This opens up the possibility of notifying client applications immediately when a change occurs in a table. For real-time applications, this push behavior is essential. RabbitMQ is a natural choice for distributing notifications of change events. [...]\r\n\r\nAnd the concrete example taken from the docs:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar tableChanges = r.db('change_example').table('mytable').changes();\r\npromise = promise.then(function(){\r\n    return tableChanges.run(rethinkConn);\r\n}).then(function(changeCursor){\r\n    changeCursor.each(function(err, change){\r\n        var routingKey = 'mytable.' + typeOfChange(change);\r\n        var payload = new Buffer(JSON.stringify(change));\r\n        channel.publish('rethinkdb', routingKey, payload);\r\n    })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this will only guarantee delivery of messages that actually arrived at the adapter script. I might have reduced the amount of errors that can occur by reducing the amount of listeners on rethinkdb, but [the network is still not reliable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing) and there will still be messages that will not get delivered, despite of RabbitMQ.\r\n\r\nSo, how is it possible to have a guarantee of delivery with rethinkdb?"
