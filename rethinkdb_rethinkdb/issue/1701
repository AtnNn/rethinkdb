        "I've made good use of `--canonical-address` for connecting two servers in different EC2 regions.\r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest that an option is added to the config file to support this, and a patch is made to the systemd init script. I think in many cases a simple option like `use-hostname-as-canonical-address` would be useful, and then all the cluster routing can be configured using a unique hostname for each node.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I hacked the `/etc/init.d/rethinkdb` script to add the following line:\r\n\r\n    set -- \"$@\" --canonical-address $(hostname)"
