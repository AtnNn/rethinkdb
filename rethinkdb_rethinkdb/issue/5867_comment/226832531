      "This is a case of our WebUI not-too-subtly guiding you to do the right thing. It is legal to have multiple shards on the same server (we call it oversharding), it is just not very useful since they get stored in the same file anyways. So there is no benefit to doing so, and we want to generally do the right thing in the WebUI.\r\n\r\nSince the `reconfigure` command is a little lower-level, we allow it to do more things, including ones that don't make as much sense (at least for the system as running). One place where this might make sense is in setting up a table, and then adding the servers to handle that configuration.\r\n\r\nI am going to close this as `not a bug`, but you can ask more questions, or give feedback here if you would like."
