      "@stijnsanders, NULL terminated strings are very annoying and inefficient to handle at a TCP level.  We can't pass the version magic number differently because we use it to maintain backwards compatibility with old (i.e. third party) client drivers.  We still use the `ql2.proto` file for definitions because it provides a single, language agnostic way to specify the structures and constants.\n\nI do like the idea about changing the auth key in the handshake to be JSON, as that would more easily allow us to include new information without changing the handshake (such as the wire protocol field in version `V0_3`).  I'll talk about it with @mlucy this week."
