      "Parsing out a config-carrying JSON document before we validate an auth key would be bad because it would expose the parser to the wild, and we'd have to be capable of handling arbitrarily large buffers, and avoiding stack overflows, and other things that we or our JSON parser didn't think of.  (Signaling underflow on ARM platforms?  Who knows?)\r\n\r\nNull-terminated UTF-8 would be fragile with respect to buggy client drivers, it's always better for message boundaries to be handled out-of-band.  Otherwise, a buggy client driver could be exploited to send attacker-supplied queries.  (It's also scary that JSON delimits data in-band, and that every JSON parser and serializer has a different idea of what JSON actually is.  The only reason we're using it is because right now it's the best way to spur client driver development.  I think in the long run we'll have C bindings and bind many of the dynamic languages to that, whether or not we stick with JSON as an intermediate message representation.)"
