      "I don't like what I'm reading. You guys want to move away from protobuf, but keep using definitions from ql2.proto? And what's with this 4 bytes little-endian up and down?

I strongly suggest you define a JSON to open the connection with, it can hold the version magic and auth key now, and options and tweaks later."
