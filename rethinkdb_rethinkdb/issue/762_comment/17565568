      "I think that there's nothing terrible enough about allowing an empty attribute to justify sacrificing JSON compatibility so we should just close this and not worry about it. As much of a corner case as this is we're never going to want to have to tell someone \"Sorry you need to change those empty attribute names to something else if you want to import your data in to RethinkDB.\" And adding extra code to deal with this is just not worth it."
