        "Please could you update the docs to include what the difference is between:\n- stream\n- sequence\n- array\n- selection\n- single selection\n\nThe official client driver docs make mention of these concepts but never define them. I'm writing a client driver and therefore knowing the difference is important.  It also appears that items like Table are a subtype of one of the above in that you can use it in place of a sequence/selection.\n\nA type hierarchy would be great. I see there is one in the [wiki](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/wiki/small-spec-fixes) but I'm not sure if it is final, and there are two different hierarchies. Including items like Table in such a hierarchy would be awesome.\n"
