      "I think if `fold` is used with an `emit` but no `base` we should have the same behavior as when `fold` is used with no `emit` and no `base` (i.e. that we consider the first element of the stream the base), just to be consistent.  \r\n\r\nThat would have the nice property that you can take any `fold` and add `emit=function(acc, row, new_acc) { return [new_acc]; }` to it in order to get a stream of the partial computations.  If we passed `null` as the base then `r.range(10).fold(lambda a, b: a+b)` would be correct, but `r.range(10).fold(lambda a, b: a+b, lambda acc, row, new_acc: [new_acc])` wouldn't be."
