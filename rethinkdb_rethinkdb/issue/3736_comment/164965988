      "Looking at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_%28higher-order_function%29#Folds_in_various_languages, about half of the languages seem to put the base first and half the function. Most functional languages (but also JavaScript and Python) seem to take the function first, while some traditionally procedural languages (C#, C++, D, Java) have the base first.\r\n\r\nI think `fold(base, f)` might read better, because you have all the data to the left, and the function body to the right (`data.fold(data, function {.......})`), rather than having `data.fold(function {...........}, data)`.\r\n\r\nI'm happy with either option. Let's go with `fold(base, f[, {emit: emitFunc}])` unless someone has strong other opinions."
