      "Oh, so `emit` wouldn't be called on the first element at all if there is no `base` argument?\r\nI find that a bit confusing.\r\n\r\nI think for the fold function it makes sense, because it obviously needs two values to work. But conceptually `emit` seems more like an iterator over the input to me, not unlike the function passed to `concatMap`. I basically expected `seq.fold(ANYTHING, emit=lambda _, x, _: f(x))` to be equivalent to `seq.concatMap(lambda x: f(x))`. I'm no longer sure if that's really a useful property though."
