      "In GeoJSON (for some weird reason), longitude goes before latitude. If you look at the [`r.point`](http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/#point) documentation, you can notice that longitude goes before latitude. That's why sometimes you notice in the documentation that it's addressed in different orders, but in this specific sentence it makes sense to put longitude before latitude, following the documentation for `r.point`."
