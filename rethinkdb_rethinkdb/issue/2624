        "After talking with @mlucy and @neumino, it looks like the reason `getField` isn't suggested in the interface is to discourage its use in favor of the `()` syntax (which is obviously much cleaner). If you type a `(`, it'll explain the behavior, but you have to know the syntax first, so it's not very discoverable.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking it should suggest the `getField` method when you type a period, and the help text for `getField` should recommend using `()` instead.\r\n\r\nCons are that the autocomplete pane is already kind of huge, so there's a tradeoff in utility here vs. adding an entry most users will only use once or twice (assuming they read the help text)"
