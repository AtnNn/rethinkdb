      "@pires thank you.  I just checkout branch next from github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb, then modify it, then push it forcibly to branch next_smart_type_conversion of github.com/sjitech/rethinkdb. It seems i should rebase my branch to some revision then merge my modification again. I'd thought these two ways are same. Anyway, hope this request works.\r\n"
