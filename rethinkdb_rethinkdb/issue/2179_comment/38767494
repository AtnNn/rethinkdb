      "For anyone wondering why we use an internal code review tool instead of GitHub's pull request system, is that we found that CodeCollaborator, as terrible as it is, is better. You can do side-by-side diffs, and have issues with the code listed on the side that you can browse in parallel with and independently from the code. These features are essential to the team here, and GitHub's code review tool isn't nearly as usable (as much as we want to use it)."
