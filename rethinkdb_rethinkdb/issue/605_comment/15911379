      "Oh turns out this actually isn't a bad issue. We have a ptr_map for the `btree_store_t`s for the sindexes. Currently they don't get created on restart. If you create a sindex, restart and then try to read from that sindex you'll get this error. Fix is simple to do a pass over the BTree on startup and recreate these structures."
