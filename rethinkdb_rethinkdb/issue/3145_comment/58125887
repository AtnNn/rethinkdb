      "Thank you for opening an issue about this @madflojo. The idea of adding encryption into RethinkDB has come up a few times before, but I cannot find an issue specifically about it either.\r\n\r\nMy opinion of the matter is as follows:\r\nThe difficulty with supporting encryption out of the box is that it comes with a high level of responsibility. There will almost certainly be vulnerabilities (either in our implementation, or in the library we might be using), and users would rightfully expect us to understand and handle these issues in a timely manner. At this point those resources are better used to improve our core feature set, while leaving encryption to external tools.\r\nThat being said, I realize that having encryption built in would simplify deployment of RethinkDB clusters significantly, so we will definitely keep that in mind for later."
