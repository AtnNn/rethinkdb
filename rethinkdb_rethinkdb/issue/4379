        "I have been having a look at these issues (#364, #4237 ) which talk about configurable sharding. \nFor range based sharding is it possible for me to provide compound sharding keys ?\nSomething like what mongo does (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/choose-a-shard-key/#shard-using-a-compound-shard-key)\nBasically I shall be storing time series data collected from sensors. \nAnd the consumption is see is mostly about data between some time. \nSo if I could use the sensor id + timestamp as the sharding key, then it would help in balancing the shard I guess.\n"
