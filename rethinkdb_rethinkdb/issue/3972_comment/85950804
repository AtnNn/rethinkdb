      "I think it's really bad that meteor is not adding new databases faster (redis is on the way, but a lot of people asked for sql and also rethink, but little progress has been made).\r\n\r\nI don't think I'm really capable of hooking the two together (meteor and rethinkdb), but I want it really badly, so I may end up tying it myself.\r\n\r\nI think we would need `changes()` added to reqlite for the integration with meteor. Do you have any plans of doing that ? How hard is it (I haven't really looked into reqlite yet)"
