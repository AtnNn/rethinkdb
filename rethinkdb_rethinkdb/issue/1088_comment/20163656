      "Hum that's interesting. I don't have an extra line on Linux/Chrome in your case.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this bug I think is just because we just have a border-left for each panel. Meaning that the border-left of the set of 4 panels is thicker too.\r\n\r\nI'll fix it by adding a border-right and collapsing border with a negative margin."
