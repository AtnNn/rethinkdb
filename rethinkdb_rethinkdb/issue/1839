        "The query `update({:age => r.literal(30)})` works. However, the query `update{{:age => r.literal(30)}}` doesn't (the latter returns a \"stray literal\" error message). Same is true for other drivers -- the server accepts `r.literal` in case we pass an object to update, but rejects it if we pass a lambda that returns an object.\r\n\r\n@mlucy -- is this expected behavior? Also, now that `merge` is going to accept a lambda, what is the behavior of `r.literal` and `merge` with a lambda? "
