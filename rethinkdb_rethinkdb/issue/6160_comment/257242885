      "I had this kind of problems before, that was the scenario:\r\n\r\nI have scripts to create the database /indexes in a test scenario and the next step was to populate data / perform assertions.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the create table scenario may fail if for some reason you run two of them doing the same thing, you will end up having multiple tables with the same name and a very similar error log are thrown. \r\n\r\nIs this somehow related to your scenario ?\r\nCheers."
