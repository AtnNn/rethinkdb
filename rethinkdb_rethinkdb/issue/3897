        "Currently the server metadata system in `raft` acts the same as it always has: new servers make entries in the semilattices, and these entries stay until the user deletes them, and then they can never come back. This made sense when the reactor was using the server metadata to decide when it was safe to do operations, but it doesn't make sense with Raft. We should do something better.\n\nThis is closely related to #3594. There are basically two options:\n- Make server metadata only visible when the server is visible. It would automatically disappear from `server_config` and `server_status` when the server disconnected. We'd have to do something special for servers that were not connected, but were supposed to be used by tables.\n- Something similar to the current system, but make servers automatically un-delete themselves if they rejoin the cluster.\n"
