        "In updating the JavaScript connection tests for #4027 I added `BLUEBIRD_DEBUG = 1` to the env variables to prompt bluebird to give better stack traces. Unfortunately a bug in the version of the library that we include (2.3.2) that makes it very slow when we have a lot of items to process and this env variable when is set. I replaced that with 2.9.25, and that fixes the problem. Obviously we would need to throughly test a new version, but we should look at updating bluebird.\n\nIn a related area, we are currently including all of the bluebird files in our repository rather than downloading them like we do for some other libraries. There well may be a reason for this, but we should at least evaluate it when replacing all of the files.\n\nIn the mean time I am going to not enable the debug output generally, but would like to have this generally as it sometimes makes the output better (but generally the JavaScript stack traces are near worthless).\n"
