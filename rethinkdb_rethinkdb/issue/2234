        "From the user:\r\n\r\nI'm having an issue trying to upgrade from 1.11 to 1.12. I'm trying to run the rethinkdb dump command to migrate my data and I get the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"Error when launching rethinkdb-dump: No such file or directory\r\nThe rethinkdb-dump command depends on the RethinkDB Python driver, which must be installed.\r\nInstructions for installing the RethinkDB Python driver are available here:\r\nhttp://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/python/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try running the `pip install rethinkdb --upgrade`, I get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"sudo pip install rethinkdb --upgrade\r\nRequirement already up-to-date: rethinkdb in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages\r\nRequirement already up-to-date: protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from rethinkdb)\r\nRequirement already up-to-date: setuptools in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from protobuf->rethinkdb)\r\nCleaning up...\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? I know there's a `$PATH` I can check possibly, I'm just not sure how to check it. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 2.6.32-042stab078.28 i686) as my OS. To install RethinkDB, I ran this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:rethinkdb/ppa   &&  \\\r\nsudo apt-get update                         &&  \\ \r\nsudo apt-get install rethinkdb\r\n```\r\n\r\nPinging @atnnn and @Tryneus."
