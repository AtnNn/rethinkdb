        "From the user:\n\nI'm having an issue trying to upgrade from 1.11 to 1.12. I'm trying to run the rethinkdb dump command to migrate my data and I get the error:\n\n```\n\"Error when launching rethinkdb-dump: No such file or directory\nThe rethinkdb-dump command depends on the RethinkDB Python driver, which must be installed.\nInstructions for installing the RethinkDB Python driver are available here:\nhttp://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/python/\"\n```\n\nWhen I try running the `pip install rethinkdb --upgrade`, I get the following:\n\n```\n\"sudo pip install rethinkdb --upgrade\nRequirement already up-to-date: rethinkdb in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages\nRequirement already up-to-date: protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from rethinkdb)\nRequirement already up-to-date: setuptools in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from protobuf->rethinkdb)\nCleaning up...\"\n```\n\nAny thoughts? I know there's a `$PATH` I can check possibly, I'm just not sure how to check it. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 2.6.32-042stab078.28 i686) as my OS. To install RethinkDB, I ran this command:\n\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:rethinkdb/ppa   &&  \\\nsudo apt-get update                         &&  \\ \nsudo apt-get install rethinkdb\n```\n\nPinging @atnnn and @Tryneus.\n"
