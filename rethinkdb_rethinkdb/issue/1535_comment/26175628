      "This error does not seem to have anything to do with missing files anymore. At least I can delete any of the files in rethinkdb_data and I do not see this error message. Maybe it's caused by corrupted metadata?\r\n\r\nThis of course makes it even more confusing and only adds to the need to change the error message once we know what this error really means nowadays."
