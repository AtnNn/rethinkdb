      "Ok, had to add `__attribute__((packed))` to two more structures: `btree_superblock_t` and `metablock_manager_t<metablock_t>::crc_metablock_t`, and I can get the database files running between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.  Going to do a little more testing, but we still can't guarantee this works unless we are sure that all data serialization is also safe, which is a little tougher to do."
