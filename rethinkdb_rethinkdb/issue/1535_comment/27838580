      "The portability changes have been approved and merged to next in commits 4bdab21, c1097e3, f005bfa, and 9a9dcfc.  This will be in release 1.11.\r\n\r\nI also investigated the minor differences I found in exported time objects, and they appear to be a result of the python implementation on the two systems, there was no difference in the data received by the client.  Therefore, there will be no new issue for that."
