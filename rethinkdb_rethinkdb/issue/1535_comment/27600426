      "So, as near as I can tell, this is a combination of two problems.  First of all, the `multiplexer_config_block_t` type is neither `__attribute__((packed))` nor padded.  Secondly, its `creation_timestamp_t` member is a typedef of `time_t`, which has a platform-dependent size.\r\n\r\nThe first is a simple enough fix.  As for time_t, we could convert all existing time_t code to use a statically-sized type, or add padding in a wrapper struct, any suggestions?"
