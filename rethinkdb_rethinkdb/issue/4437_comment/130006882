      "@danielmewes There is an alpine linux package. The downstream patch looks good to me, and could be merged if it doesn't break the build on other platforms, which I never got around to do. You might also want a CLA.\r\n\r\nhttp://git.alpinelinux.org/cgit/aports/plain/testing/rethinkdb/musl-fixes.patch"
