      "Hey all,\r\nI am working on building the latest rethinkdb (2.3.5) on alpine with Docker. I managed to make it work with [this dockerfile](https://github.com/pdonorio/dockerizing/blob/master/databases/rethinkdb_tiny/Dockerfile) and would like to give a contribution here.\r\n\r\nA few thoughts and questions:\r\n- I couldn't use the edge version of alpine for all the packages since alpine left openssl in favour of libressl, and I get conflicts. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12691733\r\n- build is very slow and it breaks the public docker hub timeout :/ so no automatic builds\r\n- How do I make a package for alpine? I saw here that @AtnNn managed to do so, but I have no clue on how to help. Also if there is eventually a way to build it not in the official alpine repo.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
