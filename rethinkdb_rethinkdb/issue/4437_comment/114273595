      "I just tried building on Alpine Linux. These are the dependencies that are needed:\r\n\r\n```\r\napk add g++ bash protobuf-dev protobuf-c python nodejs \\\r\n        icu-dev openssl-dev make wget curl-dev boost-dev \\\r\n        jemalloc-dev linux-headers\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuilding RethinkDB with\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure --allow-fetch\r\nmake -k\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerates many errors. Most of them seem minor, such as missing `isinf`, `isnan`, `int32_t` and `ssize_t`.\r\n\r\nSome of the errors are in code guarded by `#ifdef _GNU_SOURCE`. Replacing it with `#if defined(_GNU_SOURCE) && !defined(__MUSL__)` seems to work, but is inelegant. I wonder what the correct guard is.\r\n\r\nThe other class of errors I can see is caused by the lack `execinfo.h`."
