      "It's great to see an Alpine Linux package. I'll try to get your patches merged for RethinkDB 2.1.\r\n\r\nI would recommend using the system's version of all libraries except for v8 and re2, partly because their functionality is directly exposed through the query language. Using a different version could change the semantics of some queries. Also, both libraries use rolling releases which are hard to track."
