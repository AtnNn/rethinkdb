        "There are several issues with the configure script that I think should be fixed.\n1. I get a seemingly spurious warning when building support after a ./configure --fetch <dep>. For example:\n\n```\n./configure --fetch tcmalloc_minimal\nmake support\nmk/support.mk:53: warning: undefined variable `TCMALLOC_MINIMAL`\n```\n1. --fetch seems to be broken as building support with a --fetch option doesn't actually do anything. @atnnn was able to coerce it into doing the right thing yesterday but I don't know how to do it. This should just be fixed.\n2. I should be able to do something like `--fetch tcmalloc_minimal  tcmalloc_minimal=<fetch location>` at the same time. Presently this requires configuring with the `--fetch` building, configuring with the `tcmalloc_minimal=<>` and then rebuilding.\n3. Can we call `tcmalloc_minimal` just `tcmalloc`? By default we can continue to link the minimal version but it looks confusing when I have to say that I want the full version of tcmalloc to be the version of tcmalloc minimal that I want to use\n\nAs you might have guessed dear reader, I'm trying to build rethinkdb with a different version of tcmalloc. This is so that I can use the built in heap profiler. It would be nice to have a configure option that simply enables the heap profiler. I'll post more on what this option will have to do when I finally get this thing working.\n"
