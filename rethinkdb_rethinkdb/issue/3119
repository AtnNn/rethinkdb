Unfortunately dates stay as strings and saved to RethinkDB as a string.\r\n\r\nSo I can't query like that:\r\n```\r\n  var q = r.db(opts.db_id)\r\n        .table(TABLE_NAME)\r\n        .filter(r.row('at').gt(r.expr(r.now().sub(seconds))))\r\n        .[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs there is no coerceTo('Date'), how should I proceed ?\r\nThanks"
