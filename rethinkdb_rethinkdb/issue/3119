Unfortunately dates stay as strings and saved to RethinkDB as a string.\n\nSo I can't query like that:\n\n```\n  var q = r.db(opts.db_id)\n        .table(TABLE_NAME)\n        .filter(r.row('at').gt(r.expr(r.now().sub(seconds))))\n        .[...]\n```\n\nAs there is no coerceTo('Date'), how should I proceed ?\nThanks\n"
