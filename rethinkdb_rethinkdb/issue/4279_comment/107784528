      "@timmaxw I think that should work properly. As long as the second `txn_t` hadn't acquired any blocks before the first one has its destructor called, the first one should start flushing immediately.\r\nOnly if a subsequent transaction acquires a block for writing before a previous transaction gets into its destructor, it will create a dependency and the earlier transaction(s) will need to wait for the later one to destruct as well."
