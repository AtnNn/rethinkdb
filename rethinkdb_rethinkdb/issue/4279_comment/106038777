      "Suppose I have the following workload: Start 100 `txn_t`s in hard durability mode. Do some writes on the first `txn_t` and call its destructor. Before the destructor returns, do some writes on the second `txn_t` and call its destructor. Repeat. Will this work properly, or will it wait for all 100 `txn_t`s to be destroyed before it flushes any of them?"
