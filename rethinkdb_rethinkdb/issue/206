        "So the code is a little messy because we changed many times the behavior of the suggestions.\r\n\r\nSo while refactoring, I plan to solve the following issues\r\n- Find a better way to handle keydown, keypress, keyup, mousedown, click, mouseup so we can show suggestion earlier (there was some issue to get the same behavior on Chrome and Firefox). It should fix the copy/paste problem mentionned in #190.\r\n- ~~Let the user hide the suggestions - It could solve #190~~\r\n- Handle better anonymous functions. So after `r.table('test').filter( function(post) {` the user will see a suggestion for `post`\r\n- Suggestion for () after a json object (mentioned in #158)\r\n- Try to do a better job after r.letVar(). By the way isn't the return type of letVar in the docs wrong too?\r\n- Selection put the cursor at the beginning of the selection when it should be at the end\r\n- More?"
