      "We actually have no dependencies at all in the MacOS package, and our installer only installs the single file at `/usr/local/bin/rethinkdb` (#4507 would change that). We make sure that everything needed is either in the system install, or statically linked.\r\n\r\nFor users on MacOS X I would rather not add an additional official route for the following reasons:\r\n1. Using a `.pkg` installer means that upgrades are nicely handled for us. We can add or remove files and not worry about it. If you take a peek into our uninstall tool for MacOS you will see that we take advantage of this same mechanism to make our uninstaller \"just work\".\r\n2. For anything I would see someone wanting to package for deployment on MacOS X they should probably be using `.pkg` to deploy their code. Tools like [Packages](http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html) make adding our `.pkg` into yours easier. Of course that assumes you don't want to pull the RethinkDB binary into your own bundle (there are cases where this would be better).\r\n3. For the few users who could benefit from this it is not too difficult to pull `.pkg` files apart (do this in a temporary folder):\r\n  - `xar -xzf PATH_TO_PKG`\r\n  - `tar xzvf rethinkdb_server.pkg/Payload`\r\n  - `ls -l rethinkdb`\r\n\r\nI should note that regardless of how you redistributed the RethinkDB server, you would of course need to include our `COPYRIGHT` file to keep everything on the level."
