      "You can download the [Windows binary](https://download.rethinkdb.com/windows/rethinkdb-dev-preview-0.zip) at any time, Linux and OSX is a bit more tricky as there are dependencies that must be installed on the users system as well since those OSes don't support native binaries like Windows does. But that is just my 2 cents, I will leave it to the Rethink guys to give a final answer."
