      "@joeblew99: specifically on MacOS X, `.pkg` is a far better tool than wrapping things up as a `.zip` or '.tar.*', for the reasons I have highlighted above. That is why it is the preferred format for almost [1] all of the MacOS deployment solutions I know of: AutoDMG, Caspar, DeployStudio, Imagr, Munki, NetRestore, and Puppet. Even FileWave has a digester. Having done a lot of work in this area, I would strongly advise that if you are rolling your own without using `.pkg` you are doing extra work with lesser results. Even if you have never done it before, the Packages tool I mentioned above makes it really easy to create `.pkg`s.\r\n\r\nAnd I have already listed the two steps you need to do to unwrap the binary out of the `.pkg` for those rare cases where it is a better idea not to use `.pkg`. So this is not much of a speed bump, especially if you have this automated.\r\n\r\n[1] The lone exception that comes to mind is Radmind, but that is a horse of another color."
