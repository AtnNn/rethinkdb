      "Sorry I guess I am too in my head...\nBasically when for example I go to download OSX, I can only download a PKG,\nwhich is not great when all you want is the rethinkdb binary executable\nonly.\n\nThe exe is all I need for OSX ( and also windows and Linux ), in order to\nrun my code ( golang in my case ) to talk to rethinkdb.\n\nI place the rethinkdb exe inside the main deployed tar or zip that gets\ndeployed to my devices and servers.\n\nDoes this explain why all the packaging does not help me, but actually\nslows me down each time you do a release ?\n\nOn Mon, 4 Apr 2016, 22:33 Karl Kuehn, <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> @joeblew99 <https://github.com/joeblew99>: Can you elaborate?
