        "Problem description: I have a read query that takes about 10 seconds on a single node. As soon as i add a replica on a slower machine the query takes between 20 and 40 seconds. Latency and bandwidth between the 2 servers is fine.\r\nThe client(web interface) is connected to the master.\r\nThe replica is fully synced and no writes occur during the query.\r\nAnother query is taking about 700ms on a single server and 7 seconds on the replica setup. They have several chained maps with subqueries in common.\r\n\r\nYou can find the 2 queries in question, the schema, a fast and a slow profile here:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/ydnax/58aa321a1d4b353acbe3"
