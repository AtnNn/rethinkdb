      "I don't work with the code (so take my opinion with a grain of salt), but from a 10k foot view, I'd also like the templatization and dummy/memcached protocols removed. IMO complexity is death because linear increases in complexity cause nonlinear increases in development time. So, I think any complexity increase needs to have *really* good justification. In this specific case, it seems to me that the justification for increased complexity doesn't outweigh the development burden."
