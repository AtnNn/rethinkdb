      "We're really moving in a different direction. Rethink isn't the best memcached product -- there are much, much better ones out there. Currently we use the protocol internally for testing, but it would take non-trivial engineering resources to make memcached access polished enough for general use. It would take away from ReQL development, and it's something I don't think we should do. (Sorry if that's disappointing!)"
