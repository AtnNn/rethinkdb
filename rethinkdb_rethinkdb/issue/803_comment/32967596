      "until @danielmewes told me that there was a built in memcache protocol for rethinkdb i really had no idea. I know reql is amazing and all but my guess since memcache is a plain text protocol there is no binary serialization required which means basics things would be much faster in this. I have some workloads that are just get calls where this would be super useful if its already made i think it should stay"
