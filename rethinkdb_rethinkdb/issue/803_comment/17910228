      "I don't think it's productive to take an emotional reaction to a stylistic matter and make sophisticated technical arguments to justify this reaction. All of us are smart enough to argue this either way, if we wanted to. The bottom line here is that we have a lot code that most people don't like for their own reasons, and we have a clear path to remove it.\r\n\r\n> Of all the examples to come up with, this is one of the most benign possible.\r\n\r\nIt may me benign, but Mike's point is that it's unnecessary code that makes everything harder for humans to read for dubious benefit.\r\n"
