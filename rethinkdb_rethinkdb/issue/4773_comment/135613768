      "Found the problem with the system tables. There are a few operations that are genuinely slow because of the load on the table. In particular operations that need to get the status of secondary indexes (like `r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs')` and `indexStatus()`). Most other status and configuration requests are really fast though.\r\nThe problem now is that we have a mutex around a get_status function. So all the fast status retrieval operations have to get in line with the slow ones.\r\nThe dashboard uses `indexStatus()`.\r\n\r\nThe solution for that part of the problem is probably to use a read/write lock instead."
