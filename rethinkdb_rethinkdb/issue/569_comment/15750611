      "Yes, he showed me the bug.\r\n\r\nI'm in the middle of setting up my tests, so I haven't checked the code, but I have a pretty good idea why it was broken,\r\n\r\nI overwrite quotes only when I'm in a string (an object in `stack` that has the type `string`). The element `object_key` in the stack can be a string but are not reported with this type because we can declare the key without quotes.\r\n\r\nI'll fix that tomorrow morning, it should be pretty easy."
