      "I don't think we should make it optional (as discussed before), because tcmalloc helps *a lot*, and it's very easy not to link it by mistake. I'd much rather suggest `--without-tcmalloc`.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure it came up a few times on IRC on different platforms, but I can't point to specific examples."
