      "Performance gains in YCSB are not as dramatic as hoped. Roughly 15% in the read workload. \r\n\r\nHowever running analytical queries on a table with more complex documents is roughly twice as fast now. The queries and data come from an actual real-world application, so that's not an artificial test."
