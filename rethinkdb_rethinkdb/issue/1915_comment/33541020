      "@mlucy: Yeah, I thought so too. I got rid of one level of pointer indirection with the special string type. It is essentially just a length-prefixed char array, so the `r_str` pointer in datum_t can directly point to the data instead of pointing to an `std::string` which has a field that points to the data.\r\n\r\nReplacing `std::map` is a bit more involved. I will first look at some other parts of the mailbox / message handling code and then maybe come back to it..."
