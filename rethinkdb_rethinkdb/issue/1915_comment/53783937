      "To be honest, throwing an error on datums that large is not much of a break from current behavior.  If I remember correctly, we will error on a Query or Response that is larger than 64 MB, due to libprotobuf.  Granted, we are eventually going to rip out libprotobuf, but I still think we should have an upper limit on datum_ts that is far less than 4 GB."
