      "> For example, if we change the datum serialization format, then the serialized size might change, so previously legal datums might become illegal. So maybe we should measure something other than serialized size.\r\n\r\nThat would definitely make it a bad choice for https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2614 , where we might want to enforce a smaller limit. I think for enforcing the 4 GB limit that would be ok, because we don't have another choice than rejecting it anyway (unless we go for support of 64 bit offsets)."
