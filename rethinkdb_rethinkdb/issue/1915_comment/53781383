      "If we do this\r\n> Implement two serialization formats, one with 32 and one with 64 bit offsets. When serialization detects that 64 bit offsets are needed, it can transparently switch to the 64 bit format.\r\n\r\nWe can also have a third option with 16 bit offsets for small datums (maybe even one with 8 bits). That would save some memory and disk space. I think that would be pretty neat, and probably worth doing."
