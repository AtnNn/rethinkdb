      "Going to work on completing the replacement of datum deserialization soon, hopefully in time for 1.15.\r\n\r\nAfter discussion with @mlucy and @timmaxw , we decided that there should be a format that is the same on disk and in memory in addition to the current datum_t representations. The current representation will still be used for constructing new datums out of existing ones, while the more efficient non-deserialized format will be used for data loaded from disk."
