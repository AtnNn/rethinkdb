      "I think I'm going to implement variable offset sizes. That's one of the easier solutions (more difficult only than \"just crash\" and \"just use 64 bit offsets\"). It also has advantages apart from dealing with big datums gracefully, namely it saves a significant amount of space for use cases such as large arrays of numbers."
