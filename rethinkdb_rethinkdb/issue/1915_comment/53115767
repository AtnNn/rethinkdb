      "Doing an `r.table()` on the table with the complex documents now takes 1 ms server time for the first batch, vs. 12 ms with the old datum format.\r\n`r.table(\"...\").map(function(x) {return x;} ).count()` goes down from 7.7s to 160 ms when data is in the cache. I think this will solve some of the complaints people have (rightfully) had about the performance of non-optimized `count()` queries."
