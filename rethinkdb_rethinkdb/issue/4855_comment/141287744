      "@sontek -- this is expected behavior.\r\n\r\nIn general, to survive K hardware failures, you need K * 2 + 1 servers. So, for example, to survive two hardware failures, you'd need a cluster of five servers. We need this for the Raft consensus -- we can't guarantee data consistency unless we can get a majority vote.\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense -- closing this issue, but feel free to comment if you have more questions.\r\n\r\n"
