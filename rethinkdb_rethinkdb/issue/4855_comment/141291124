      "@sontek Actually you *can* still read from a single node, but you need to tell RethinkDB that it's ok to ignore any writes that might since have been acknowledged on the other side of a potential netsplit.\r\n\r\nThe way to do that is to pass the `read_mode=\"outdated\"` optarg to `table` or `run`."
