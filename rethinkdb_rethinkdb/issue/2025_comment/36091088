      "One way to address this problem would be to do something similar to what we do with generated keys.\r\n\r\nWe could return something like\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        group: \"hello\",\r\n        value: [\"hello\", \"hello\", \"hello\"], // trunk to X elements, 100k may be too much.\r\n        warning: \"<warning message>\"\r\n     },\r\n    {\r\n        group: \"world\",\r\n        value: [\"world\", \"world\", \"world\"],\r\n        warning: \"<warning message>\"\r\n     }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nBut that would mean that the ruby/python driver would need to return results like in javascript.\r\n\r\nNote: It may seems like I'm doing a sneaky attempt to get what I proposed for the ruby/python driver, but I genuinely believe that adding a warning message is good trade off.\r\nThe warning message could mention to use `coerceTo(\"ARRAY\")` if users want to retrieve everything (with a note about memory)."
