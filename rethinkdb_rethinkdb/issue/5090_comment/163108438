      "`'merge'` may have other connotations, perhaps `'mode'` instead?\r\n\r\n`'ordered'` makes me think that the result would be ordered. Perhaps `'add'`, `'append'`, `'argument_order'` or `'left_to_right'` instead?\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could also allow specifying the order in the same way as in `order_by`? Either by allowing something like `.order_by(sort=lambda a, b: a < b)` or `.union(comparing=r.desc('a'))` or both. Otherwise using `order_by` and `union` together would be confusing and inconsistent."
