      "The selector-function proposal sounds reasonable to me. Would you be able to return `r.desc(\"foo\")` from the function?\r\n\r\nI think the optarg should be called `interleave`, not `interleaved` by the way.\r\nI'm not completely happy with the name `interleave`, but I don't have any other idea right now that hasn't been mentioned yet."
