        "It's better to clone 'hostOrCallback' to avoid side effects.\r\n\r\nIf you run r.connect more than one time with the same config object,\r\nit gets mutated in case 'username' is set instead of 'user'.\r\n\r\nThen, the second time you run r.connect, with the same config object,\r\nthe driver will complain that you can't use both 'username' and 'user'\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nObject.assign on 'hostOrCallback' will fix this issue."
