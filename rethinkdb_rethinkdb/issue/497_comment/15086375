      "This is already what we do in the cluster layer and there's a good argument for unifying. Supposing we limit to `b` bytes in the cluster layer and `n` results in the driver layer. If a person stores documents that are `b / n - \1013` you'll basically wind up transferring `2 * b` bytes to return `b` bytes to the user every time which is a lot of extra latency."
