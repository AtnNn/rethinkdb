        "There are currently three ways to serialize an object in the drivers.\n1. `r.expr(obj)` converts it to a tree of datums and uses protobuf serialization, this is slow\n2. `r.json(JSON.stringify(obj))` uses native JSON serialization, this is pretty fast\n3. `r.exprJSON(obj)` is used by `insert` to convert the parts of the object which can be to JSON. For a large pure JSON object this imposes a penalty over option 2 but is still faster than option 1 for mixed objects (those that have a little bit of ReQL code burried somewhere) that can't be handled by option 2.\n\nCurrently, option 3 is an internal helper used to implement `insert`. We should probably expose this to users and document it so they can use it elsewhere they want to.\n\nN.B. While `insert` uses method 3 by default and all other uses method 1 by default, any of the three behaviors can be forced by manually wrapping the object before passing it into a ReQL api function.\n"
