        "@nviennot previously suggested in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1876#issue-25845181 that we could provide some level of integration with node discovery tools. In that issue, that included determining secondary/primary roles and auto-failover which we are now going to implement ourselves.\r\nHowever a remaining question is (cluster) node discovery. @dminkovsky recently ran into some issues when trying to use etcd node recovery to create a RethinkDB cluster (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3215).\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could integrate with tools such as etcd to automatically discover RethinkDB nodes.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what it would take to do that exactly. Maybe a simple script around RethinkDB would be enough?\r\n\r\n( @deontologician @AtnNn )"
