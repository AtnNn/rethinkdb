      "After thinking about this for a while, I'd like @atnnn to be the tie-breaker when it comes to test-related issues like this one. It's his job to make tests actually run as part of our development process, so he should have the authority to decide what to do when people disagree. It might inconvenience some people, but without that our test situation will never improve.\r\n\r\n@atnnn -- please use this new power wisely.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I agree with @atnnn and @mlucy -- we should fix the tests or open an issue if the tests don't get fixed. Having perpetually broken tests in the suite will forever prevent us from having a good test suite integrated into our development, as will the wishful thinking that we'll some day fix all tests and they'll stay fixed.\r\n\r\nI do think that there should be an easy way for individual developers to enable tests in their local branches via some sort of config file or env variable, so @srh can continue depending on the behavior of failed test output without having to locally reenable them all the time."
