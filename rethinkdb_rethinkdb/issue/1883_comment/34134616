      "I'm with @atnnn here.  Arguably the real problem is that I didn't fix the test right away (I sort of stopped paying attention to GitHub while I work on `gmr`), but if tests in next regularly fail people stop being worried when they fail, and the tests become less useful.  If there's a failing test that won't be fixed close-to-immediately, we should open an issue and disable the test until it's fixed."
