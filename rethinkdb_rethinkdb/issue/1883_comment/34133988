      "@srh sorry about the broken build.\r\n\r\nI strongly disagree about keeping failing tests enabled. I think that tests in next should never fail. When they do, ideally the offending commit should be reverted, the test should be disabled or the failure should be fixed very quickly. When I test my code, it shouldn't fail because of someone else's commit. I believe it is much more useful to have an open issue about the failing test than to have the tests fail for over two weeks."
