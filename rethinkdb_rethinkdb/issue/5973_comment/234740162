      "Well, it's official: this PR isn't winning any beauty contests.. I added a weird :query_handle_class option so the QueryHandle class can be overridden for async alternatives.\r\n\r\nHow is test coverage on the Ruby driver? I used this command: `RUBY_DRIVER=`which ruby` ./test-runner -i rb em` and it ran only 3 tests that didn't fail even though I had made an obvious mistake."
