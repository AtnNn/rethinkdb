      "I don't know who has setup CircleCI, but that is not how we do testing, and it does not seem to be testing anything. To run our Ruby tests [1] for checking the changes you made you should [2] run the following commands:\r\n1. `./configure --allow-fetch` (see #5620 for why)\r\n2. `./test/reql_tests/test-runner -i rb`\r\n\r\nNote I am assuming that you are modifying the driver in `drivers/ruby`. You only need to play with `RUBY_DRIVER` if you are trying to modify one in another location (and `which ruby` would not give you the correct value for that).\r\n\r\n[1] Yes, you should run all of them.\r\n[2] I am including instructions from the root of our repository. The testing system actually does not care what your `pwd` is for most things."
