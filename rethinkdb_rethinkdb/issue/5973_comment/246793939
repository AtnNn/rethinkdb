      "@tinco No worries, congratulations on the house!\r\n\r\nDepending on how much time you think you can spend, we could also take this over from here and do the testing (and any potentially necessary fixes) ourselves. Let me know if you'd prefer that. Your work on this PR is a big help in either case!"
