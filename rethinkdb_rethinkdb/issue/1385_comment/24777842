      "Just to clarify: What is the \"write rate\" exactly? Is it the number of btree write transactions or something like that?\r\n  In other words: Are the GC writes part of the write rate or is the actual amount of data written to the disk the sum of write rate (times some factor) plus GC rate (times some factor)?"
