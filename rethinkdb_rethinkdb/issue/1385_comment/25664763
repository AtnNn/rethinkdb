      "Addition: After re-reading @underrun 's original problem description, I should point out that the original problem was with non-batched inserts, so the batch splitting will actually not have an impact on that scenario.\r\nWe still have to fix the stalls in @mlucy's insert workload and the splitting does improve that one.\r\n\r\nThis might be a good time to re-visit the throttling hypothesis. Some throttling improvements are already in next, and I will check how much difference they make now that we have gotten (most of) the flush lock stalls out of the way."
