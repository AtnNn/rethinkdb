      "Turns out throttling was actually not the problem for the workload that @mlucy reproduced the issue with. Even though there were a couple of things about throttling which were worth improving anyway, and the improvements help on my test with smaller caches.\r\n\r\nA further inspection of the data suggests that there is a negative correlation between a specific part of the writeback process and the slowdown of the queries. So this is the next hypothesis to test. I have to run further experiments to locate the cause more exactly."
