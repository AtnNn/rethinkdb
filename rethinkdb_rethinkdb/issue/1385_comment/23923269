      "I'm seeing a similar square-wavey thing after inserting ~30m 2k documents with soft durability, wavelength of about a minute and average throughput of about 2k docs/sec.  (The throughput at the start was closer to 6-8k/sec.)  I'm seeing the square wave in the data explorer, but I don't think it's due to a stats timeout because the peaks of the wave correspond with high CPU usage, and the troughs with almost no CPU usage.\r\n\r\nI talked to Slava and he mentioned that it might be because of how we flush dirty blocks in the buffer cache, and that @srh might have a way to improve that once he's done making `env_t` reentrant."
