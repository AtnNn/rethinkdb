      "I'm using external performance measurement for my per minute counts - i'm actually monitoring the queue that is feeding rethinkdb. whether or not the admin web page is underreporting performance, rethinkdb is not keeping up with my queue ... which is about 3k/min average, but it does dip and spike and with my perf resolution at the minute level, the instantaneous spikes could be quite large. Since my recorded data is per minute and the per second data i reported was observed at some point during the event I don't have a good way to reconcile the two.\r\n\r\nLiterally the performance graph of the per minute data looks like a square wave. With a wavelength of 10 minutes and at best about a 50% duty cycle. To top that off, looking at the performance over time, the oscillation is unstable with a steady maximum and decreasing average insert rate. It took about 12h to degrade to the point I described in this issue from when the square wave behavior started emerging.\r\n\r\nI've got enough memory to try it with with a larger cache, but it took about a week to get to this point and unless I missed something I would have to recreate the table to change the cache size?"
