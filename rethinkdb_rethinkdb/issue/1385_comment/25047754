      "In my small-scale tests this behavior was caused by our throttling.\r\n\r\nI'm going to make the throttling gradual, and also fix a few additional problems with our current implementation. This should avoid sudden drastic drops in throughput. On average, the throughput is not going to increase though, because it is probably limited by disk throughput and/or how efficiently we make use of it.\r\n\r\nWorking on the throttling changes in branch daniel_throttling."
