      "Could garbage collection play a role in this, potentially when it competes with btree reads due to an out-of-cache condition? I feel like we had this tuned pretty well, but it might be worth to recheck that.\r\n\r\n@mlucy: Would you mind checking how the serializer_data_extents_gced perfmon behaves during good and bad performance phases? It could also be interesting to check serializer_block_reads during those phases (specifically the recent_duration avg and max values).\r\n@underrun If you like, you can also have a look at these values when you point your browser to http://<rethinkdb-server>:8080/ajax/stat . However it can cumbersome to actually filter out the relevant parts.\r\n\r\nI think this is a good time for writing a tiny script for visualizing perfmons post-mortem. Unless Slava manages to interfere before I can finish, this is what I'm going to do now."
