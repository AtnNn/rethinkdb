      "We're presently in the process of setting up long running performance tests to weed out issues such as this one. #1369 describes the first workload we're going to focus on which seems to be similar enough to this workload that it should uncover whatever problem it is you're hitting. This should get better withing the next few releases. One question I have is how long has the server actually been running? Judging from your numbers here (30M docs and 2K/minute) it seems like it's probably been up for about 10 days. Is that about right?"
