      "So the test implementation I used which removed the issue completely was actually not correct. I now have a correct implementation, but for performance reasons it cannot split the insert batches into overly small chunks. The issue is still noticeable with this version, even though it is strongly reduced.\r\n\r\nWe might be able to get rid of the flush lock completely eventually, but that will take more time as it requires deeply overhauling or re-implementing most of our cache.\r\n\r\n@underrun Sorry for not being able to completely resolve the issue as quickly as hoped. You should see significant improvements with the next version though."
