      "@KyleAMathews Sorry, forgot to update this.\r\nWe've shipped RethinkDB 1.16 and an easy way to check the health of the cluster now is to run\r\n`r.db('rethinkdb').table('current_issues').count().eq(0)`\r\n\r\nIf it returns `true`, then everything is ok. If it returns `false`, some server is down or there is another issue with the cluster.\r\n\r\nWe haven't gotten around to adding an HTTP end point for monitoring yet. For now you could set up a webserver yourself with a script that performs this query."
