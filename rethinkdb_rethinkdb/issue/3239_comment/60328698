      "What sorts of checks / information would you like to see in such a command?\r\n\r\nWe are actually working on an entirely new administration API where you can check the status of a table very easily through ReQL. You can see the basic layout of the data it returns in this comment https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2983#issuecomment-54391302\r\nAs you can see there are a couple of different `ready_for_...` levels, which you can look at to check whether a table is available for a certain operation or not.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, there will be a way to check on existing issues in the cluster through a ReQL command as well (with information similar to what currently appears in the web UI if for example a server goes down). Here you can see the basic format https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2864#issuecomment-53827701\r\n\r\nDo you think that API is going to work for your use case?"
