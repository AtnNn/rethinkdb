      "@wojons it will go away immediately with the release of reql_admin. These have always been inofficial APIs that were not meant for being used by outside tools.\r\n\r\nWe have a `reql_admin` branch that is getting more complete by the day now. We should talk on IRC when things are sufficiently stable, so we can start converting ElasticTrace and any other tools you might be using yourself that use these endpoints."
