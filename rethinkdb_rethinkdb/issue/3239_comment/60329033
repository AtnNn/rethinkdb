      "That'll be awesome. But something even more simple would be great. E.g. if /health-check returned `200` if the cluster is healthy and `503` if not. Something really lightweight that people's monitoring setup could ping every few seconds.\r\n\r\nThe additional information would be fine or even helpful perhaps as long as it's a very lightweight call.\r\n\r\nAlso, it'd be annoying or perhaps impossible to install a ReQL client everywhere I'd want to use this. So an endpoint that just returns JSON would be great."
