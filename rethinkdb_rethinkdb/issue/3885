        "The Raft system assumes that backfills work even if the starting version is not an ancestor of the ending version. Our current backfill logic crashes in this case. We need to fix it.\n\nThe general solution is this: Suppose we are backfilling from version A to version B. Their common ancestor is X. The backfillee needs to find all the keys that changed between X and A, and ask the backfiller to send new values for those keys, in addition to sending all the changes between X and B.\n"
