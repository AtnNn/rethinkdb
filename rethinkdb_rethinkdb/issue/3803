        "I often need to use the admin console for both development and production and it would be great if there was a very visual way of differentiating them so I don't do something catastrophic in production.\n\nFor example, perhaps a new color option in the config file that could be used to do something attention getting.  Changing the color of one of the following might be useful:\n- Add a bar of color under the sidebar (say a 6px div all the way across)\n- Change the background color of the icons on the sidebar.\n- Change the color of the server name on the sidebar.\n\nMaybe put the color closer the destructive items like an optional colored bar across the top of the list of tables and the text area in the Data Explorer.\n\nThis might go along with the Friendly server names #3029 \n"
