      "Very mysterious. I definitely can't see anything in your commits that should affect normal (non-clustered) query behavior.\r\n\r\nJust to make sure, could you try the experiment with e.g. only the first of your three commits applied?\r\nThe only other thing I can think of is that having additional commits after the last tag (v2.3.4) will change how the version number is generated. You can take a look at the scripts/gen-version.sh script, and maybe (for testing) make it output `2.3.4` instead of what it usually does. I have no clue how that would have any effect on this test though. Maybe it affects rethinkdbdash somehow."
