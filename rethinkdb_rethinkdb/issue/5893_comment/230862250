      "@danielmewes I can certainly check it out. Would it be possible to try to reproduce it on your side of the equation as well? I did my tests on three separate machines with no success, and I sort of stopped working on it since then because it was slowly driving me mad \128516 \r\n\r\nI do modify the `gen-version.sh` already, and simply add a `-sid` to the end of the version, but like you I can't think that would have anything to do with the runtime. I'm also pretty deeply familiar with the internals of rethinkdbdash and can't think of where that might affect anything on that side. It does seem more likely to me that it has something to do with stripping the binary, or rather something compiler related."
