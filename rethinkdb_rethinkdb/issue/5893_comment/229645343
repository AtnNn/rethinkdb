      "@AtnNn yes I'm very careful to `git clean -dfx` before each build, and I've modified my testing process to configure with `--fetch all` as per your suggestion on slack. I agree with you assessment that the PPA might be building with different options, but I'm not sure it explains the fact that the vanilla `v2.3.4` builds and works fine (both remotely and locally built deb packages), as well as the fact that the `sid` (my changes from the PR) deb when built locally exhibits the same behavior as when built remotely on the PPA. \r\n\r\nThere are three particular commits, you can see them on this branch: https://github.com/mbroadst/rethinkdb/tree/stop-reconnect-unknown-sid-on-v2.3.4. That code is branched off the `v2.3.4` tag, with the three commits from the PR on top of it. There are no logs of interest whatsoever when run, and I can't really see much of a cpu deviation when doing quick monitor with `htop`. It does feel like something is screwing with coro's internally, but I'm not quite sure how to prove that atm.\r\n\r\nI would be incredibly interested to see if you guys get the same results as I do building a deb at your office, would that be possible?\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** let me know if it would be easier to deal with if I squashed that to a single commit"
