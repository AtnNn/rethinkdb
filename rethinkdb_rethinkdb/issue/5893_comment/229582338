      "@mlucy The debian package might get passed different `--fetch` options or be built with a different version string. It might also get stripped differently. The dpkg build process might also be using a different toolset or default compiler options.\r\n\r\nIt's possible there are interfering artifacts from previous builds. Perhaps running `make clean` or even `git clean -xd` before building might help.\r\n\r\n@mbroadst What is the exact commit? After the connections start failing, is the server still running? Is it under high load or is it hung on IO? What does its log report?"
