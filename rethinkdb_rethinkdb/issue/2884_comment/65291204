      "@timmaxw The row format looks great. I think 1ms time prevision is fine. If a server emits more than 1,000 log messages in one second things are going to look a little weird, but in that case there's a problem anyway. We have to keep this limitation in mind though if we later want to add additional logging features (for example https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/544 or https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2238)."
