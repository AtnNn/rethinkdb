      "@danielmewes: Another option would be to use a precise round-trippable type in the primary key. For example, we could use a string in ISO8601 format with 9 decimal places on the seconds, which is the same format we use in the log file itself. This means essentially no limit on the rate at which we generate log messages (1 per nanosecond). Being able to assume round-trippability also makes the code more elegant in some other ways."
