      "This looks great.\r\n\r\n> how to handle the case where a new server connects or a known one reconnects with respect to changefeeds on the log table\r\n\r\nAborting feeds if a server connects/disconnects would be very annoying IMO, and seems very counterintuitive. When a new server connects, I'd definitely go with option 3 (keep the feed, but do not send notifications for the old entries of the new server). When a server disconnects, I'd do nothing (i.e. do not abort the feed).\r\n"
