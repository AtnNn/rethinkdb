      "What would be a use case behind \"Index log statements using a positive or negative integer\"?\r\n\r\nHaving the pseudo table expose `[<UUID>, <TIME>]` as the primary and another secondary index on `<TIME>` sounds reasonable.\r\nThe only problem I see with that is that using compound indexes is a little awkward in ReQL right now. A common use case I think is to get all logs for a given machine, ordered by timestamp. At the moment one has to use some weird `between` statement for filtering on the first component of a compound index.\r\nThat will become much nicer when we address https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2670 ."
