      "It seems better to me to have just the timestamp be the primary index (or the timestamp plus some uniqueifier).  You can tack a normal filter on the end to get the logs for a particular server -- there probably won't be that many, so it won't be that much slower.\r\n\r\nAlso, a primary key of `[uuid, time]` makes it really hard to say \"give me all the issues from the last day regardless of server\", which I think is another common query."
