      "My only concern with that is that it would be annoying/inefficient to get a range of log statements from a specific server.  What if we made it `id: [<UUID>, <TIME>]`, then had a secondary index `timestamp`?  This would allow selecting log statements by time range across the cluster or on a specific server, just using `between`."
