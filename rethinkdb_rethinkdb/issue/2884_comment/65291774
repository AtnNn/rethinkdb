      "@marshall007 It's not really a compound index in the same sense as for secondary indexes. In secondary indexes you can index multiple fields together. In this case you still have a single field `id` as the primary key, except that it happens to have array values. The allowed data types for primary keys in RethinkDB are numbers, strings, binary values, bools, arrays, and times (no objects though)."
