      "@coffeemug does this proposal look ok?\r\n\r\nAnother question that came up is how to handle the case where a new server connects or a known one reconnects with respect to changefeeds on the log table.\r\nShould we abort the changefeed (like when a server disconnects)?\r\nShould we keep it and send change notifications for all the old log entries that the server has?\r\nShould we keep it, but not send notifications for the old entries of the server?\r\nThis situation is somewhat unique, because in other tables having a server reconnect typically doesn't add loads of new entries to the table. On \"real\" tables for example you wouldn't even be able to have a changefeed if any of the primaries is down.\r\n\r\n(I personally have a slight preference for aborting changefeeds on the log table if a new server connects.)"
