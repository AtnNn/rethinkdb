      "What if `r.match()` could be partially applied?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.row('tags').contains(r.match('^h'))\r\nr.row('tags').map(r.match('^h'))\r\n```\r\nProviding static, curried versions of certain RQL terms has broader implications and could simplify a lot of queries (see the second part of #3485 for example). Furthermore, I'm pretty sure all such curried terms could be implemented in the drivers with no changes to server code."
