      "That's an interesting idea @marshall007 .\r\n\r\nOne possible source of ambiguity is that in this case, the first argument to `match` (as in `arg1.match(arg2)`) is the one that's left undefined. So the currying is not applied from left to right.\r\nInstead we might want to always leave the first argument `arg1` open for terms that are usually applied in the form `arg1.term(arg2, ...)`. This is something we have to think about a bit, and it will likely require some additional logic in the drivers."
