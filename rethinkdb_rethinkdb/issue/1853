        "... because they are configured with a time interval of just 1 second.\r\nSome processes can easily take multiple seconds (especially i/o related things, writebacks etc.). So if I check the perfmons at a random point in time, there is a high chance that they don't show any data because the slow event is happening less than once per second.\r\n\r\nWe should check the configured recording intervals and adapt them where necessary. Assigning to myself."
