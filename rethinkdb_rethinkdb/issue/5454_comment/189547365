      "Can `.catch` actually catch exceptions? That would surprise me. Isn't it just a function call on the promise?\r\nIf `eachAsync` indeed throws an exception directly, I would expect the behavior that @larkost describes, i.e. ending up in the \"actual\" `catch` with `console.log('Rather I get here');`"
