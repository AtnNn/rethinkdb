      "According to the docs, it's supposed to catch exceptions thrown inside a `then` block coming before it:\r\nhttp://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/catch.html\r\n\r\nIt can catch them because the `.eachAsync()` call is wrapped in a closure, but it wouldn't be able to catch problems with arguments to `.table()` etc, since those aren't part of the promise chain."
