      "@larkost as it is, your example is basically equivalent to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nPromise.resolve()\r\n.then(function() {\r\n  throw new err.ReqlDriverCompileError(\"...\")\r\n})\r\n.catch(function(err) { console.log('I should get here'); });\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince you're in a `.then()` callback when the exception is thrown, I would expect this to already work as you've described it should. Are you certain it's not?"
