      "> I wonder if it's just count, aggregations in general, or range queries in general.\r\n\r\nThe way the code's structured, count should be doing strictly less work than a reduce (it follows the same code path, but doesn't load the document off disk or do any work on it).  So this almost certainly happens with other aggregations too.  (There could, of course, be a bug that makes count alone way slower.)"
