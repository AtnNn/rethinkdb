        "Many people want Rethink to support a unique secondary index feature (see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6804275 for the discussion). Currently people have to resort to code like this:\n\n``` javascript\nr.branch(r.table(\"users\").getAll(email, {index: \"email\"}).isEmpty(),\n         r.table(\"users\").insert(user),\n         {})\n```\n\nThe main problem with this code is of course that it isn't atomic -- there is no guarantee that the result is unique. This would also be an issue with any reasonably doable implementation of a unique index feature. However, this may be an acceptable tradeoff, or there may be some other creative solution here. We should brainstorm and see if we can come up with some options.\n"
