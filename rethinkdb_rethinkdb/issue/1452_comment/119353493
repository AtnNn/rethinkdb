      "Some queries in RethinkDB are deterministic, and others aren't.  We keep track of this internally, but don't expose the information.  If we exposed the information in `info` we could write tests to assert that queries we expect to be deterministic are, and queries we expect not to be deterministic aren't.\r\n\r\nThis requires server work before any new tests can be written.  (Maybe it should be in backlog instead of testing?)"
