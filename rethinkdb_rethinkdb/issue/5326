        "Any thoughts on supporting v2 raspberry pi.\r\nThe v2 is  is a different arm ISA version and much easier.\r\n\r\nI currently run my middle tier code on raspberry pi with golang. It's very easy.\r\n\r\nIn terms of OS, I am currently using Ubunutu Core. It's 16.04 LTS.\r\nBasically libs and or application for the next version of Ubuntu can be written as debs or the new Snaps.\r\nSnaps can reference deps. Installing Snaps is crazy easy, as is writting them.\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/build-apps/\r\n\r\nRaspian is also another option as an OS. It's a bit different in terms of tooling. Bespoke you could say.\r\n\r\nI prefer Ubuntu core and Snaps because then for servers, desktop and embedded writting and installing is 100% the same. So I am hoping that this fact leans you to packaging as Snaps :)"
