        "Hi,\n\nthis was by no mean a scientific benchmark, but I played around with Rethinkdb and Mongodb in Go and measured how long time it took to insert around 29K of documents using the [Zip JSON](http://media.mongodb.org/zips.json). On my computer, the results were 9 seconds for Mongodb and 21-22 seconds for Rethinkdb. There is of course overhead of the Go drivers for each DB, but I didn't expect to see such difference in performance. Has anyone done any similar comparisons that can either confirm or deny my results?\n\nRethindb: 1.11.2\nMongodb: 2.4.8\n"
