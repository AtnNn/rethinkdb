        "Reported [on twitter](https://twitter.com/GrzegorzNosek/status/463732276514525184).\r\n\r\nBuilding should be possible with the system protobuf library and without `--fetch protobuf`. Another workaround is to copy `libprotobuf.a` to `lib/` where the rethinkdb makefile expects it to be.\r\n\r\nThis bug can likely be fixed by adding a configure flag to `mk/support/pkg/protobuf.sh` or just symlinking `lib` to `lib64/`"
