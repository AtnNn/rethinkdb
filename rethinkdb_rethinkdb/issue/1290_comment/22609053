      "@neumino Yes. We actually have no way of telling the difference between the output of `datetime.utcnow()` and `datetime.now()` or really any other python date without timezone information since `utcnow` doesn't set the timezone. You could always do `datetime.now(r.make_timezone(\"00:00\"))` though to get the equivalent of `datetime.utcnow()` with timezone information. Alternatively, `datetime.now(pytz.utc)`."
