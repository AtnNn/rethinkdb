      "I'm still not a big fan of prefixing everything. There is a reason why people love chaining, and that's because it's the natural way to do things.\r\n\r\nThe way I build a query when I want to retrieve all the posts with all its comments is:\r\n1. I get the post\r\n2. For each post, I retrieve the comments\r\nWhich translate in `posts.join( comments)`\r\n\r\n\r\n`r.and(a, b, c)` is better than `a.and(b).and(c)` but `a.and(b)` is better than `r.and(a, b)`\r\n```"
