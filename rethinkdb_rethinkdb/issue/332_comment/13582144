      "@neumino I think from a PL perspective you are right about JOINs syntax. In SQL you can usually write joins in 2 ways:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM table_parent JOIN table_child ON condition\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nFROM table_parent, table_child WHERE condition\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've almost always used the 2nd form and that's probably why I think I'd prefer `r.join(table_parent, table_child, condition)`"
