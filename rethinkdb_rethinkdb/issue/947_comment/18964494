      "To give a little more info on how I think we should tackle this:\r\n\r\n1. If somebody has a spontaneous idea on what might cause this, we should verify that hypothesis. @mlucy: any suggestions?\r\n2. If 1 doesn't lead to success relatively quickly, we should take the systematic approach and profile the whole thing. I've successfully used the profiler built into Solaris Studio http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solarisstudio/downloads/index.html on RethinkDB in the past (used it on Linux), and I was very satisfied with what it did (I recently had to use the Intel Parallel Studio one and it was awful to use in comparison). @wmrowan: If not done already, I think it would make sense for you to set up some profiler. We will very likely need it for solving a number of issues soon anyways."
