      "There are only a few query languages features that we use in YCSB. Beyond the basic operations like get, between, and update, that we have to have, we only use pluck, and limit.\r\n\r\nWith both pluck and limit we could choose to implement the same functionality in the client but that involves transferring more data to the client than is strictly necessary. Ultimately it will be faster to ensure that these commands are fast than to try and work around the fact that they are slow by avoiding them. Given how easy it was to fix pluck (and I think limit is already doing the right thing) I don't think this is actually something we need to worry about anymore."
