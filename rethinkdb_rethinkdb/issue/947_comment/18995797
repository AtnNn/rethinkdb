The problem is gone.\r\n\r\n```\r\nGet: 1161.05924555qps\r\nGetAll: 1108.7861070552qps\r\nGet pluck: 1032.0003712373qps\r\nGetAll pluck: 907.12853594443qps\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I can chain without() behind a get() as much as I want... :-)\r\n\r\n@jdoliner: I consider this solved. I think it is not necessary to make pluck or other commands copy-free at this point, for the reasons that you've mentioned. We will get back to that in a couple months maybe..."
