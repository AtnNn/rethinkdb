      "I'm pretty sure this is caused by the fact that we make a copy for `pluck`. It would be pretty easy to fix. However we should bear in mind, there are a huge number of inefficiencies like this in the query language and we obviously don't want to take the time to fix them all right now. Ideally we want to only fix critical path things like base write performance and base read performance because otherwise performance becomes an intractable task. However I guess this issue becomes critical path due to the fact that YCSB uses it. Is there anyway we could work around this and have YCSB not use it?\r\n\r\nAlso I'm going to hack up a copy free version of `pluck` so we can test the hypothesis."
