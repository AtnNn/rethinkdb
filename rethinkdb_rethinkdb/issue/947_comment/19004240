      "@coffeemug it's kind of moot in this case because we already solved it but what you're saying doesn't really clarify issues like this. In this case pluck is on the critical path only because of how we choose to implement YCSB. We could have implemented in another way and completely ignored pluck. So we need to give a bit more thought to what's actually on the critical path and what appears to be on the critical path."
