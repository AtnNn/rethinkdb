      "@jdoliner: Yes, we can absolutely live without it for a little while. YCSB doesn't have to use pluck. I believe that there actually are other more relevant issues with YCSB for now. However query processing will matter soon enough.\r\n\r\nWhat really smells are the quadratic costs. Also, copying should in no way account for a 40 % performance hit. I mean we are talking about 800 queries per second here. Not 8 million. What I want to say is: I have some hope that there's a deeper issue behind this, which is not specific to pluck. Solving it could have a positive impact on a lot of queries."
