      "Would be interesting to know how much the performance impact actually is in a benchmark like https://github.com/ajselvig/RubyDatabaseBenchmarks (also see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1798 ).\r\nThat benchmark uses pretty simple queries, so there might be applications where it has more impact. Still it would provide us with a rough ballpark figure.\r\n\r\nPS:\r\n@nviennot did some tests as part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/1842 . If I read those numbers correctly, the time difference was in the range of 0.1 ms for constructing a query. So I expect relatively little difference in the numbers that we get from the mentioned benchmark, given that we get only ~500 qps in the first place (so it would be a time saving of ~5%). Now in an environment with multiple concurrent clients (or multi-threaded clients), the impact can be significantly larger though."
