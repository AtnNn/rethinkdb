      "Doesn't the web UI do it by issuing a distribution get?  I don't think the same thing is available to the RQL clients.  We could do it if we had the http port in the import/export scripts, but it seems rather silly to require users to provide that just so we can have a progress bar.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner, the smoothness I was worried about was more along the lines of having one table with very big rows and another table with very small rows.  If we aggregated the progress of all tables into a single percentage, the user would observe the progress go very quickly until the table of small rows is done, then slow down significantly while the table of large rows finishes.  Thus, why I think it's probably better to show the progress of the least-completed table."
