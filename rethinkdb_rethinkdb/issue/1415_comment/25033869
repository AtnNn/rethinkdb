      "Out of date count isn't available in RQL clients but it could very easily be added. I'd just add it and perhaps leave it undocumented for now so we don't need to figure out how to explain it to users, we could also just add it fully as `approx_count` or something. Using true `count` could actually wind up adding a decent amount of overhead to the script."
