        "From #2957:\r\n\r\n* I should be able to just call reconfigure() with no arguments and have the system reassign shards to machines if it makes sense. At least in the Python driver I get a \"not enough args\" error.\r\n\r\n* We should consider again making shards and replicas named arguments and allowing passing one at a time. ~~I know there were problems with this approach, but from the UI perspective it would be such a huge boost, I think we should at least revisit it now that we have more information. Let's talk about this in person.~~ (We decided to have shards and replicas default to the current number of shards and replicas.)"
