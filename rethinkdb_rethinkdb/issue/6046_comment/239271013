      "Thanks for reporting this @sagivf .\r\n\r\nIt doesn't look like the Link header is valid in that response. According to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988 page 6, the `link-value` must consist of an URI-Reference enclosed in `<` and `>`. In this response, the closing `>` is instead HTML-escaped into a `&gt;` which I think is wrong in an HTTP header.\r\n\r\nOne thing we should change I think is that if `r.http` is used with the `page: null` option, we should ignore parsing-errors in the `Link:` header (or not parse it at all). It looks like currently we always parse the `Link:` header, so there is no way to use `r.http` with pages that return an invalid `Link:` header."
