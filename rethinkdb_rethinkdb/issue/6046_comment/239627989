      "Hey @danielmewes, thanks for looking into this.\r\n\r\nSo I if I understand correctly, this is failing because rethink is trying to parse the link header for pagination? (nice, wasn't aware of that option)\r\n\r\nNot sure about the `page: null` - If i'm not interested in paging I don't think it should matter, If I did I can understand why an invalid header should fail the request.\r\n\r\nI'm find with both though. Any chance to get this fix in soon? \r\n"
