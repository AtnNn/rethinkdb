      "So the dude who originally reported this seems to have given up on RethinkDB without providing any more information about this bug. I'm not even totally sure what he meant by the connection getting \"stuck\". I've tried to reproduce something, anything, like what he described but am seeing no memory leaks on `outstandingCallbacks` when I run a long running insert only workload with 500KB documents.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug would it be alright to close this as a can't reproduce bug?"
