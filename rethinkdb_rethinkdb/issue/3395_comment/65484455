      "Thanks for the suggestion @marshall007!\r\nWe actually already have some discussion about it in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2629 . The running proposal is to have an `if_empty` opt arg to `reduce` (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2629#issuecomment-47708763 ), which seems like it would work in your case.\r\n\r\n(closing as duplicate of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2629 )"
