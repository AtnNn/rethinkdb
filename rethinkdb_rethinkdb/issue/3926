        "Currently if you use `r.connect().repl()` it gets set in what is effectively a global variable. We have some warnings in the docs and source that this should not be used in a multi-threaded environment, but no enforcement of this.\r\n\r\nIt would be really easy to make this variable be thread-local, and then have a second flag so that we can give a good error message in cases where the connection is then used from another thread."
