        "When a Safari/SafariMobile browser hits our WebUI it is also looking for either an `/apple-touch-icon.png` or a `/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png`, and we have neither. This puts two additional log entries like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSomeone asked for the nonwhitelisted file \"/apple-touch-icon.png\". If this should be accessible, add it to the static web assets.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth to allow the graphical bookmarking, and to remove these potentially confusing log entries we should add the files. This is a reasonable [writeup](https://realfavicongenerator.net/blog/apple-touch-icon-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/) of what is needed.\r\n\r\nWe should also make sure that our website has this as well."
