        "@encryptio noticed that `ftruncate` probably makes our table files sparse on Linux, depending on the file system. That might make writing to the end of the file inefficient, because it will potentially require the file system to frequently update its metadata structures. I suspect that this will be particularly relevant for hard durability writes on rotational drives.\r\n\r\nWe should look into ways of making `ftruncate` not do that, and benchmark whether it has an impact on performance."
