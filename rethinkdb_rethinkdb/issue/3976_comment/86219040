      "Actually, maybe not 100% reproducible, earlier I started the server back up (after the first crash) and re-ran the query and it blew up on me again, but after I made a sandwich and came back and started the server back up for a second time, the secondary index appears to be working now. Weird. I gzipped the directory in case you want it."
