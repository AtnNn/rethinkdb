      "Shortly before we got this error we added a new index (on 1.16) and tried to use it before it was finished creating.\r\n\r\n    RqlRuntimeError: Index `foo_index` on table `db.table` was accessed before its construction was finished. in: r.table('table').between([27L, r.iso8601('1400-01-01T00:00:00+00:00')], [27L, r.iso8601('9999-12-31T23:59:59+00:00')], left_bound='closed', index='foo_index', right_bound='open').order_by(index=r.desc('foo_index')).without('id')\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, what I meant earlier by that we had rebuilt all indexes was that we got warnings about indexes that needed to be rebuilt after we upgraded to 1.16. We had already done that when this error occurred.\r\n\r\nWe have not had this error again after the rethink daemon was restarted.\r\n\r\nIt's a clustered setup running on AWS."
