      "We hit this bug almost any time a server is restarted.  Now that the apport stuff is enabled, it's even worse, since that spins at 100% forever, instead of rethinkdb getting restarted.    This is really so bad that it makes using rethinkdb as a cluster worse regarding \"single point of failure\" than it would be to just use a single big rethinkdb node...   How can we use automatic failover, if failure of one node (even on purpose via \"service rethinkdb stop\") leads to other nodes segfaulting and exiting?   Sorry, not happy right now."
