      "My theory about the bug turned out to be wrong, and we currently don't have an explanation for this.\r\n\r\n@haraldschilly Did rethinkdb leave a core file behind by any chance?\r\nIf not, could you enable core files for the future, in case this happens again on one of your servers? A core file would make it a lot easier to debug this issue if it ever happens again."
