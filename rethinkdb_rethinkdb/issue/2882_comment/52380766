      "We use the terms \"broadcaster\" and \"listener\" internally. In the internal usage, a \"primary\" has a broadcaster and a listener. Maybe we could have a set of servers for a shard, and one of the servers is the broadcaster.\r\n\r\nEdit: I guess that's a bad idea; we want a term that people will have heard before."
