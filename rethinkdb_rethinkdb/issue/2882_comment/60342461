      "I think we should use \"primary\" and \"replicas\", for a couple of reasons:\r\n\r\n- Other people do it, so it won't confuse anybody\r\n- It doesn't have evil imperialist connotations\r\n- It's better than \"master\" and \"servers\" in the following ways\r\n  - \"servers\" is confusing. For example, if I look at table status and see \"servers\" for a shard, I don't know what that means. Does the shard somehow reside on multiple servers? Or are multiple servers responsible for it? Is it sharded across these servers? Whereas if I see \"replicas\" I know exactly what's going on -- these are all replicas of this shard.\r\n  - \"primary\" is more \"adjective-y\" than other possible terms, so I can combine the two into \"primary replica\" and it still makes sense. I think that's really delightful.\r\n"
