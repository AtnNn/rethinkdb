      "The problem I have with `primary`/`secondary` is that they sound mutually exclusive, like a node can't be both a primary and a secondary at the same time. But the APIs in #2680 and #2857 treat the \"primaries\" as a subset of the \"secondaries\", like some nodes are just secondaries and other nodes are both secondaries and primaries. So the terms \"primary\" and \"secondary\" don't really fit."
