      "`master` is widely used, but it might be politically incorrect. See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master/slave_(technology)#Political_correctness_issue>. Apparently Django and Drupal 8 both switched from `master`/`slave` to `primary`/`replica`. But we've never used the term `slave`, and `master`/`replica` has a different set of connotations than `master`/`slave`.\r\n\r\nHowever, the \"master copy\" metaphor isn't actually correct for our case; it's hypothetically possible for a replica to be more up-to-date than the master, in which case the replica will take precedence."
