      "> Are we sure we want that abstraction (i.e. that we don't want disjoint sets in the interface)?\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure. But that discussion probably belongs in the other issues.\r\n\r\n> We could also sidestep the issue by not using \"replica\". What if we just called the replicas the nodes for that shard, and one of the nodes was the master?\r\n\r\nI like the idea of calling them \"servers for a shard\", but I don't think it counts as \"sidestepping\" the issue. We still have to decide on the right term for `master`."
