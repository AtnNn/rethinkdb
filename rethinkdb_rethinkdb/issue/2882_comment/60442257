      "@coffeemug -- the problem with \"primary\" and \"replicas\" is that when we say \"1 primary and 3 replicas\" we mean \"3 servers one of which is the primary\", but users think \"4 servers one of which is the primary (the other 3 are replicas)\".  People are confused about this all the time.\r\n\r\nI would be OK with using \"primary\" instead of \"master\", but I really think our old primary/replicas terminology is confusing for people."
