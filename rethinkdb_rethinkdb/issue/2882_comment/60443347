      "> the problem with \"primary\" and \"replicas\" is that when we say \"1 primary and 3 replicas\" we mean \"3 servers one of which is the primary\", but users think \"4 servers one of which is the primary (the other 3 are replicas)\".\r\n\r\nI'd get around this problem in the following ways:\r\n\r\n- Instead of just saying \"primary\" in the relevant field names, always say \"primary_replica\" instead.\r\n- The name of the primary replica server would always be a member of the \"replicas\" array. If the user tries to set it to something else, they get an error.\r\n\r\nI think that's good enough. Even if you say \"servers\" and \"primary\", there is still opportunity for confusion (is the primary one more server, or is it one of the existing servers?) It's admittedly a little bit less confusing, but I think it doesn't get around the problem entirely. On the other hand just saying \"servers\" is *really* confusing, because it's not at all clear that these are copies of the data.\r\n\r\nSo I'd call it \"primary\" and \"replica\" and then do a really good job explaining that the primary is one of the replicas in the docs. When I played with the admin queries, doing it that way wasn't confusing and was really really nice.\r\n\r\n"
