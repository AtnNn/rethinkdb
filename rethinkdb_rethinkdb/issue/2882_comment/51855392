      "I'm trying to come up with words that accurately describe what the \"primary\" does. The `leader`/`follower` metaphor is not bad. The word `router` is the most accurate term I can think of, but it has other connotations in a computer networking context. Slava suggested `director` and we've been using it in the preliminary work on the new ReQL admin API, but it seems odd to me. Maybe we could use `coordinator`, but that sounds like the leader of a consensus protocol to me.\r\n\r\nWe might be better off with a term that's widely used but not literally correct than with a term that's accurate but nobody has ever used in this context before.
