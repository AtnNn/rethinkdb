        "The query language code uses a lot more memory in 1.4.x than it did in 1.3.x. While we're generally putting off fixing performance regression there is evidence (see #505) this this is causing blocking problems for users.\n\n@mlucy suggests that this is primarily because the `datum_t` and `val_t` structures are deliberately dumb and use a lot more memory than necessary. @jdoliner suggests that this is related to the custom memory management system in place in the new query language code. There might be other reasons as well. Better memory profiling will be needed to both determine the size and significance of this regression from 1.3.x as well as determine the sources of the problem.\n"
