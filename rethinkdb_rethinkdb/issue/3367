        "I have been thinking that I still do not use change feeds because they do not give me enough promise that the function is going to run for many reasons. after speaking with @timmaxw  for a few minutes there looks like there is an easy way to give users the options for triggers.\r\n\r\n - use most of the code that runs for when an index starts\r\n - before the corutine launches check to see if node is primary of the shard o the document\r\n - allow for non determanisc queries\r\n - allow for a timeout if the user wants to allow for a timeout\r\n - #997 allow users to make mistakes. Lots of the issues with dealing with trigger development is making sure the users dont mess up. Let the users mess up and fix the bugs from there. users that are using trigger to update tables will have to be responsible for not ending up in a never ending loop."
