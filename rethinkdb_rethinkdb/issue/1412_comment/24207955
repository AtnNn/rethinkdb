      "@jprichardson -- thanks for your feedback. We're working on improving the documentation now, we'll try to make some time to give love to the config file docs.\r\n\r\nThe first time you start the server you can pass `-n` followed by the machine name (e.g. `rethinkdb -n foo`). If the node already has a name (i.e. you're restarting Rethink) the `-n` argument will be ignored. You'd have to create a brand new node (for example, by deleting `rethinkdb_data`) to give it another name. Currently there is no way to rename a machine from the command line.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."
