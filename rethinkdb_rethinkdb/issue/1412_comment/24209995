      "Excellent... because I'm using Ansible and building a RethinkDB playbook. So, if I can configure `machine-name` in the instance config file, that should hopefully solve the problem.\r\n\r\nWhat'd be really helpful if you guys would create a different documentation repo so that your users can do PRs for your docs."
