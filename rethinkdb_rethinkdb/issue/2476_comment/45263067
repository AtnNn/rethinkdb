      "I looked into this a little, and this is complicated a bit because `jinja2` it depends on [MarkupSafe](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MarkupSafe), which includes a compiled C part. It is still includable, but a bit messy. Since this is the only place where it is required I am looking at how hard it would be to replace its use by using handlebars, which we already have a dependency on."
