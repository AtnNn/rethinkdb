      "After a little bit of playing with it I settled on replacing Jinja2 with [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io). It is light enough to include the file in the repository (along with the MIT license file). The branch of this is `larkost/2476-test_report.py-requires-jinja2`, commit is fe484c0, and the review number 1594."
