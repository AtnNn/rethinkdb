      "One point; are the inserts made using `noreply` ? If so, then no (depending on definition of \"reliably\").\r\n\r\nAs the data is being inserted in the background you can't retrieve it immediately. To make sure the data is written, call without `noreply` option (the `insert()` returns after completion), or use `noreplyWait()` after the inserts have been performed (waits until writes using `noreply` has been completed).\r\n\r\nIf you're not using `noreply` then you may have encountered a bug... But someone who actually knows things should probably step in here (i.e. not me)."
