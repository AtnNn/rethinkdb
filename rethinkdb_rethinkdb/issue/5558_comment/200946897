      "@QianJin2013 If you want to post the `bulkInsert` I can take a look and see if I can spot anything wrong. Though it looks like it's working now?\r\n\r\nIn general indexes are consistent as soon as the write operation returns. Though you will get inconsistent results if you run the `count` while the write is still happening, or when using `noreply` writes as @tatsujin1 mentioned."
