I have not used noReply mode, i just use normal insert method.\n\n\nThe select use an new connection than insert.\n\nThey are just executed by junit one by one, i have confirmed insert is\nfirst get executed.\n\nI will try it again by using same connection.\n\nAnyway, this is not easy to happen.\n\nI have uploaded test source to\nhttps://github.com/sjitech/rethinkdb_test_java\n\nThe error happened at\nhttps://github.com/sjitech/rethinkdb_test_java/blob/master/src/test/java/PerformanceTests.java#L297\n\nI suspect that index has not yet completly built for new inserted rows,\nthis is async.\nWhile select does not know the status, so it could not use the excepted\nindex.\n\n\n2016\24180\&3\26376\&24\26085\26408\26332\26085\12289Tatsujin<notifications@github.com>\12373\12435\12399\26360\12365\12414\12375\12383:\n\n> One point; are the inserts made using noreply ?
