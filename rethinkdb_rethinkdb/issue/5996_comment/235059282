      "In your solution would you still consider using the internal executor / response pump / `Future<T>` threading mechanism?  If not, then I think there could be more motivation to consider https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5380 and move the Future/awaiter mechanics down to `SocketWrapper`.\r\n\r\nThis way, maybe, if we pushed the awatier/threading mechanics down to `SocketWrapper` (#5380) then allowed you to replace/implement `SocketWrapper` with your own `ClojureSocketWrapper` it could work.\r\n\r\nThe only trouble ahead I see would be the need for `ClojureSocketWrapper` to be respectful of the `Response.*` members `Connection` expects to see in `Response` when making decisions about deserialized responses, ie: if the response is a sequence, make and keep track of a `Cursor` 'n stuff...\r\n\r\nAlternatively, allow you to replace the entire `Connection` :sunglasses: .\r\n\r\n:rocket: \r\n\r\n:cloud: :sunny: [**Bassnectar - Chasing Heaven - Into the Sun**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2BAia075lE)"
