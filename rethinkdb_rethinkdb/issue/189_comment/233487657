      "This is now in `next` with 1e868573 from branch `larkost/189-add-rethinkdb-shell` after review CR 3694. We decided to use `rethinkdb repl` since that is the command we have both in the Python driver and in ReQL.\r\n\r\nNote for integration: this has both Python driver and server components, so needs to be done with some care. We should also make care to note the rev-lock in the release notes."
