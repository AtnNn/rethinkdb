      "I have implemented something similar to this in the Python driver in df57248. That allows you to `python -m rethinkdb repl` and it will get you a shell/repl with the driver imported (as `r` and `rethinkdb`) and a connection (`conn`) established to a server if possible (even using `.repl` to make `run` easy)."
