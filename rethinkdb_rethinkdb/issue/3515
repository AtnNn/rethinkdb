        "My reading (and @timmaxw seems to agree) of `./test-runner polyglot/regression/665` is that it is highly dependent on exactly how the sub-shard hashing of keys works, and this is not bound up with that code at all (so might already be an invalid test).\r\n\r\nThis regression test should probably re-worked as a unit test that mocks the hashing code with something that it can predict/synced with.\r\n\r\nThis is low priority."
