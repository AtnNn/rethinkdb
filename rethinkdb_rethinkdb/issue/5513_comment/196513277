Some implementations probably ignore duplicate vertices.\r\n\r\nWe are not currently doing this, though we're planning to filter out duplicates automatically in the future, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4518 .\r\n\r\nAt the moment you'll need to filter the input geometry yourself."
