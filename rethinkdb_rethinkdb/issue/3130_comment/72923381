      "If we change `tableCreate(...)` to `table(...).create()`, we should also change `dbCreate(...)` to `db(...).create()` and `table.indexCreate(...)` to `table.index(...).create()` (compare https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3663 ).\r\n\r\nI think it would make for a pretty nice and consistent interface.\r\nSimilar to #3663, I'm on the edge to moving this out of 2.0 though.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether interpreting `create()` like an exception handler is a good idea. For that to actually work `create()` would have to return the created table instead of the configuration, which comes with the usual problems when trying to use it with `forEach`."
