      "Also, implicit table deletion is a bad idea. Consider this scenario: The user creates a table and sets some configuration options (primary key, sharding and replication settings, etc.). Then they start a workload against the table, which at some point causes the number of rows in the table to drop to zero. When they try to insert into the table again, it will be implicitly re-created but with the default settings."
