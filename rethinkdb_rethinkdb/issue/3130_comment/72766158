      "I still think `r.table('foo').create()` when `r.table('foo')` doesn't exist is kinda nuts (and we'd have to rejigger things a bit internally to make `r.table('foo')` return something lazy).  I would be OK with `r.table('foo').drop()`, but I don't feel strongly about it, and the asymmetry would be a little ugly."
