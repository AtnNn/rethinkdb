      "`r.table(\"foo\").drop()` is pretty nice, but I'm not a big fan of `r.table(\"foo\").create()`.\r\nWhile it makes better demo, it feels a bit weird to me to select something that doesn't exist, and then create it (like if things were in the wrong order).\r\n\r\nIf https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2355 can make it, it would mean we just need to implement `r.table(\"foo\").drop()` :)"
