      "It wouldn't be totally implausible. But \"not totally implausible\" is a really low bar. To make table autocreation work in a sane way we'd need either cluster-wide or database-wide Raft coordination, which isn't currently on the road map. The problem with implementing either of those is that then the user would have to manually add and remove servers from the cluster-wide or database-wide Raft cluster. For tables we add and remove servers from the Raft cluster when users add and remove them as replicas for the table, so the user doesn't have to do it manually. Even if we decided that was an acceptable price to pay, actually implementing the cluster-wide Raft would be a fair amount of additional work."
