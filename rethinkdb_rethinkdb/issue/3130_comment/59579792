      "yeah, as long as tables actually have settings, and aren't just a name like databases, auto-dropping sounds bad.\r\n\r\nBut that kind of fits with this proposal overall. Everyone is like `r.table().create()` is weird because the table doesn't exist yet, but autocreation fixes that perception, and you could use `.create()` as an opportunity to specify settings on the new table.   `table().drop()` works too, since it should probably be explicit."
