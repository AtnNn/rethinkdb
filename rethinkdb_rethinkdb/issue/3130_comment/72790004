      "I am with @deontologician in which I like `r.table(\"foo\").create()` and `r.table(\"foo\").drop()` both.  The selection arguments hold no particular truck with me, and I find it attractive.  Especially I like `r.table(\"foo\").config()`.\r\n\r\nI don't think implicit table creation is such a great idea although some command we could issue that worked like `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` per MySQL would be fine.  Key is that it should be opt-in.  In contrast I think implicit table deletion is a *terrible* idea for reasons that have already been explained."
