      "We don't seem to be coming to a consensus on this one.  Everyone except @timmaxw seems to like `r.table('test').drop()`, but only @deontologician and @gchpaco seem to like `r.table('test').create()` (and I dislike it pretty strongly, personally).  It would be unfortunate to have the two diverge.\r\n\r\n@timmaxw -- Would it be totally implausible to use the upcoming raft implementation to make table autocreation work in a sane way?  That would get around a lot of these problems."
