      "@danielmewes Some applications may want some sort of \r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table().insert()\r\n```\r\n\r\nand that just creates the table as you insert the data i feel like dpeending on your setup this could be bad or good. some people like tables that create them selves on first insert. I think it should be a database or cluster level choice for easy table creation."
