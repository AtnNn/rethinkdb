      "Well, the main argument *for* `table.create()` is that it looks consistent, not that it makes a ton of sense. Pretty much everybody in this thread has said that they don't like `.create()`. I'd be interested in  @coffeemug's opinion, but I don't think it would be a blight on the language to leave `.tableCreate` laying around. It could always be revisited later if it just sticks out so badly that it's intolerable."
