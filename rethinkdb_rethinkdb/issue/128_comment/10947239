      "This was explained in the e-mail. Here's the proposal for do:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.do(r.table('test').get(0), r.table('test').get(1),\r\n    r.js(function(row1, row2) {\r\n        return row1.value + row2.value * 5;\r\n    })\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think we need to address this now, we'll address it in the new spec with the `do` command. @mlucy -- is `do` part of the spec? If it's not, add it! If/when it is, could you close this issue?"
