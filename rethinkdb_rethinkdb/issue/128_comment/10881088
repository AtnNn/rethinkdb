      "So back in the olden days you could do this:\r\n```ruby\r\nstream.map(r.func(\"x\",\r\n  r.js(\"x+1\")))\r\n```\r\nThen we switched to using anonymous functions, so you instead have to write this:\r\n```ruby\r\nstream.map {|x|\r\n  r.js(\"#{x}+1\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI.e., you splice the variable into the string.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we completely forgot to change the Python and Javascript drivers to support something similar, so they currently have no way to access RQL variables from javascript."
