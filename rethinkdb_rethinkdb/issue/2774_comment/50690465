      "I'm honestly not sure what to think.  There are basically three options:\r\n* Require people to re-create sindexes this release.\r\n  - This sucks, and we need to stop doing it.\r\n* Keep the old behavior for old sindexes\r\n  - This is a pain in the ass.\r\n  - This can be confusing: why does this one sindex act totally differently than new sindexes with the same code?\r\n  - We could make this less bad by logging a warning when we read an sindex with a comparison operator in it.\r\n* Re-interpret old sindexes to use the new behavior.\r\n  - This is terrible.\r\n  - It might not be so bad here because it only matters if you're comparing times to strings, which is probably exceptionally uncommon.\r\n  - We could still log a warning.\r\n\r\n@srh -- I assume you're strongly in favor of the second option?"
