      "So, in the simplest example I can come up with, a user has a table with one entry: `{date:<time object>}`.\r\n\r\nThey add an index `r.row('date').lt(\"some string\")`.  Granted, this is a pointless index, but bear with me.\r\n\r\nBefore changing `datum_t::cmp`, the index for this row would be `false`.  After changing `datum_t::cmp`, the index would be `true`.  If they were to upgrade from the old behavior to the new behavior using the same data files, their rows would now be indexed incorrectly (that is, if they were to delete and reinsert the row, the index for it would change).  I'm not sure what effects this may have on various queries."
