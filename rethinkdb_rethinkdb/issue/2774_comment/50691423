      "I see, you mean re-create the sindex from scratch to match the new interpretation of the sindex function?\r\n\r\nWe'd have to re-create almost all the sindexes (since so many things do comparisons), which would prevent queries on the sindexes from running, possibly for a long time, and afterward the results of some queries would be different than they were before.  But maybe that's better than the other options; what do other people think?\r\n"
