      "@neumino -- if you call `r.now.typeof` the output should be something like `PTYPE<TIME>`.  We generally have the rule that types sort according to the output of `typeof`.  (This is why `time_to_str_key` says they sort between `NUMBER` and `STRING`; `N < P < S`.)  I'm not sure why `datum_t::cmp` thinks that pseudotypes are always larger than real types.  That logic seems odd to me too."
