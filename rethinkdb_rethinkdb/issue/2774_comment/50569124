      "The orderings in `datum_t::cmp` and `time_to_str_key` don't match up.  `datum_t::cmp` says that pseudotypes are always larger than \"real\" types, while `time_to_str_key` says they sort in-between `R_NUM` and `R_STR`.\r\n\r\nWe need to make these consistent for anything to make sense.  Since people probably have data on-disk indexed by a pseudotype, I think we should change `datum_t::cmp` to reflect `time_to_str_key`s semantics."
