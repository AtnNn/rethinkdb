      "Here's a proposal: If these changes might break an index, then we flag the index and put a warning message in the log. Queries against a flagged index fail with a message explaining the situation. The user can rebuild the index (which automatically clears the flag) or manually unflag it. If the index should have been rebuilt but the user manually unflags it, then the behavior is undefined."
