      "Python and Ruby were handing a broken pipe in a way that never printed the server error. I am seeing the proper error in js, but sometimes not, which is odd.\r\n\r\nOk, looks like the error is propagated back to the user to handle. So if you don't handle the ReqlDriverError in the callback to run, then it just complains that you didn't handle it rather than telling you what it is."
