      "GitHub for Mac's installer has a yes/no dialog that pops up asking if you\r\nwant to install command-line tools -- as another option for the installer\r\nflow.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Jul 23, 2014 at 8:51 AM, Karl Kuehn <notifications@github.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Additionally the third option there would allow for a \"Start RethinkDB\r\n> now\" button/checkbox in the installer.\r\n>\r\n> And an alternate to having an external script would be to embed the tool\r\n> directly into the RethinkDB binary as another command-line option. MacOS\r\n> would be easy there, but figuring out what to do for the various linux\r\n> startup systems would be more difficult.\r\n>\r\n> \8212\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\r\n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2717#issuecomment-49893525>\r\n> .\r\n>"
