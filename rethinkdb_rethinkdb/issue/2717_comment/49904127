      "GitHub.app's behavior is possible because you are downloading a(n) .app. It just does this when it creates its preferences file for the first time. Since we don't have a(n) .app that route is not an option for us at this point. If we wanted to create some sort of app, either as a bundle around the server, or as a administration tool then we can do something on that line."
