      "Additionally the third option there would allow for a \"Start RethinkDB now\" button/checkbox in the installer.\r\n\r\nAnd an alternate to having an external script would be to embed the tool directly into the RethinkDB binary as another command-line option. MacOS would be easy there, but figuring out what to do for the various linux startup systems would be more difficult."
