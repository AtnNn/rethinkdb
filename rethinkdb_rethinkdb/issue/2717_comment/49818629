      "I don't think we should install a LaunchDaemon plist as part of a normal install. However, there are 3 pretty easy solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Include a script to create the LaunchDaemon plist and install it alongside the rethinkdb binary in `/usr/local/bin/`. This is probably the most flexible because it allows for post-installer setup.\r\n2. Add a second off-by-default package to the installer package. This would require that people click on 'custom install' in the installer and opt-in to the package. This is relatively easy to do.\r\n3. Write a installer plugin to provide a GUI during the installer to allow people to choose whether to set RethinkDB to start on boot. This could use the script from number 1 in the background.\r\n\r\nNote that the biggest problem is that we need to set the location for the data files, as well as what user the rethinkdb process should run as. I think that pushes us to 1 or 3. The user part is actually the most annoying part (I know how to do this)."
