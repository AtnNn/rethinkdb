I'm not entirely certain about the steps to replicate this, but here is a set of likely steps:\n- Create a cluster of two machines (one per datacenter).\n- Create a table, set one of the datacenters as primary, have a replica in each datacenter.\n- Manufacture a netsplit.\n- Turn off primary datacenter on one of the sides.\n- Rejoin the machines.\n- Try to do anything with primary datacenter setting on that table.\n"
