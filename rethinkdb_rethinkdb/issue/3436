        "@timmaxw has a need for partial matching of dictionary results in the polyglot tests (specifically to keep from having lots of unneeded boilerplate for checking `table_create` results).\r\n\r\nThe solution we worked out is to add a `partial` function to the polyglot \"drivers\" that will match any array or dictionary (depending on type) that contains all of the key/value pairs (just values for arrays)."
