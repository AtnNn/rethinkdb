      "The first commit for this is in the mis-named commit 82c74d7. The review is 1619. I needed to make minor changes to both the cpplint program (comment out a print statement), and check-style.sh script (allow it to be run from anywhere, remove the grep -v for the aforementioned print statement). This now should be in the full test suite."
