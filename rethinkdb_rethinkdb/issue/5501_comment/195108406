      "It seems to be working for me. Note though that the default behavior of `changes` changed in RethinkDB 2.2 when it comes to `get` queries. Previously they would always emit the initial value of the document. Now - in order to be consistent with changefeeds on other queries - this only happens if you specify the `include_initial` option to `changes`.\r\n\r\nDoes it work as expected if you do\r\n```js\r\nr.table(\"events\").get([\"ok\", 4]).changes({includeInitial: true})\r\n```\r\ninstead?"
