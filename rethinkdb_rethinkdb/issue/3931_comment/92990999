      "As the lead developer of the rethinkdb-net library, I'd also be interested in hearing any feedback on my project.  I'm sure there are things that could be done better, some of which I'm aware of, but I'd be happy to hear if there's anything I'm missing.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the one area that mfenniak/rethinkdb-net is truly lacking is documentation.  We do things a bit differently than the official RethinkDB drivers because .NET is a strongly typed environment and this driver is made to fit into that world.  Unfortunately, that means that it's not simple to compare RethinkDB's documentation with our driver and expect everything to work."
