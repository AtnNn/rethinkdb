      "From the driver documentation: \r\n\r\n>\"RethinkDB manipulations (pluck / merge / without / append / contains) and control structures (branch / forEach / error / coerceTo / typeOf) are not currently supported. Some manipulations (pluck / merge / without / append) are maybe not really compatible with the strong typing approach this library currently supports.\"\r\n\r\nIn practice, LINQ for performing queries on dynamic objects seems limited (pseudocode below, but perhaps I'm doing something wrong here?)\r\n\r\n    books.Filter( book => book.Name.ToLowerInvariant().Contains( \"foo\" ) );\r\n\r\nwill result in an exception. @mfenniak, perhaps you can suggest a workaround for this scenario and also chime in on the current level of support for the RethinkDB streaming APIs.
