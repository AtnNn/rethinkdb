      "Whether the approach of mapping LINQ expression trees into ReQL is the best approach to a .NET driver or not would be a great discussion to have.  If you want to have that discussion, I'd really enjoy participating in it, and we should take that to the rethinkdb-net project (as opposed to here).  I have considered before that it might be better to have two layers of functionality within the driver; a basic layer that just provides all the operations with no type-safety but is easy to write and update, and a higher-level type-safe layer sitting on top of it.\r\n\r\nThe query you're trying to write doesn't seem to be supported by RethinkDB; RethinkDB's \"contains\" operator doesn't work on a string.  RethinkDB does have a match operator for regular expression matching which could be used though; rethinkdb-net doesn't expose that currently (mfenniak/rethinkdb-net#107).\r\n\r\nIt also isn't supported by rethinkdb-net because we don't have a mapping for ToLowerInvariant() into the ReSQL downcase operator.  I'll add an issue to support that (mfenniak/rethinkdb-net#206) and implement this for both Lower and Upper.\r\n\r\nThe current head of rethinkdb-net supports the streaming APIs on most of the queries.  I just closed your issue, mfenniak/rethinkdb-net#190, after merging this support in 4 hours ago.  A couple streaming cases aren't supported yet."
