      "@quentez: we arent going to declare an official driver soon, so feel free to pick whichever you like. But we would likely use the bchavez driver since it's similar to the java driver and is easier to maintain. The mfenniak driver will likely continue to be the more idiomatic driver for reasons discussed in bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver#18"
