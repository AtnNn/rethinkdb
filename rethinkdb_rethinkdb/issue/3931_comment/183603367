      "@srh No worries. Your :beetle: spidey-sense can rest at ease. The [bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver](https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver) now follows proper C#/.NET naming conventions for the **ReQL AST** and all public APIs (`v2.2.5-beta-3` or later). It's a bit of whiplash for those upgrading to `v2.2.5-beta-3` but I'd rather do it now than later. Docs updated too. :+1: \r\n\r\nAlso, fixed a bug in the ReGrid file storage API: https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver/issues/28 \r\n\r\nThank you all for your valuable feedback. Brian"
