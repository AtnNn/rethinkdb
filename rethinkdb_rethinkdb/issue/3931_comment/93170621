      "@danielmewes well. I don't know how many people are asking for a native driver, but I'd reconsider the java over c# priority. With the new aspnet stack coming down any day now, it would be really great if you could take a ride on it's momentum to have gain some traction. If we think about aspnet5+rethinkdb+signalr, we certainly have a stack as powerful as nodejs+rethinkdb+socket.io."
