      "Thanks Mathieu, let's continue this conversation over on the rethinkdb-net project. In case my intent was misinterpreted, I have been using your driver, and I think it's a great start. I filed this issue after a chat with @deontologician to list rethinkdb-net as the official .net driver and perhaps work with you to attain feature parity while preserving idiomatic C#/.net APIs. "
