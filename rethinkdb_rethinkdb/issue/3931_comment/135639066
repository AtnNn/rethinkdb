      "Hey everyone, I created a new C# RethinkDB driver here: https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver\r\n\r\n[bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver](https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver) is modeled closely after @deontologician 's current Java driver progress (pretty much a one-to-one port of the Java driver). It follows the same build process and driver architecture as Josh's current Java driver.\r\n\r\nAs with @deontologician 's [Java driver connection unit test](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/8e701ed158e649c25984e568431e96d5c675b24a/drivers/java/src/main/java/com/rethinkdb/RethinkDBTest.java), the [bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver](https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver/blob/master/Source/RethinkDb.Driver.Tests) C# driver passes its first connection unit test too. :+1:\r\n\r\nI hope to continue following Josh's Java driver work closely and keep this new driver up-to-date since they both share the same architecture."
