      "@luisrudge Thanks for your feedback. You make a good point.\r\nThe reason we're going to support a Java driver first is that a) we've seen quite a bit of demand for it and most importantly - b) there isn't an up-to-date community-supported driver for it.\r\nrethinkdb-net on the other hand is already a really good driver, and it's up to date and maintained."
