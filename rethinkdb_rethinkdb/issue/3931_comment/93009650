      "We're going to expand our set of officially supported drivers over the next months. We'll start with a Java driver (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3930 ), but I think a C# driver might be next on our list (though this isn't completely planned out yet).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure yet how we are going to do this exactly, but one option is to integrate the great driver by @mfenniak and the other rethinkdb-net developers into our testing system and documentation. We would then make sure to submit patches for protocol changes and extensions on time for our official releases."
