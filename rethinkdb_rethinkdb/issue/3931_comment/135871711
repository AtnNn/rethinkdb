      "Nice! I am going to have to document this thing better now I guess...\n\nOn Thu, Aug 27, 2015 at 10:27 PM Brian Chavez <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hey everyone, I created a new C# RethinkDB driver here:\n> https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver\n>\n> bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver <https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver> is\n> modeled closely after @deontologician <https://github.com/deontologician>\n> 's current Java driver progress (pretty much a one-to-one port of the Java\n> driver). It follows the same build process and driver architecture as\n> Josh's current Java driver.\n>\n> As with @deontologician <https://github.com/deontologician> 's Java\n> driver connection unit test\n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/8e701ed158e649c25984e568431e96d5c675b24a/drivers/java/src/main/java/com/rethinkdb/RethinkDBTest.java>,\n> the bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver\n> <https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver/blob/master/Source/RethinkDb.Driver.Tests/ConnectionTest.cs>\n> C# driver passes its first connection unit test too. [image: :+1:]\n>\n> I hope to continue following Josh's Java driver work closely and keep this\n> new driver up-to-date since they both share the same architecture.\n>\n> \8212\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3931#issuecomment-135639066>\n> .\n>\n"
