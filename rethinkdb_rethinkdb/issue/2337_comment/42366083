      "@chrisguidry What a nice offer! I also enjoy stout.\r\n\r\nI was planning on closing the ticket when these changes get merged into v1.12.x, which theoretically also needs to be fixed (although I have not been able to reproduce the bug in v1.12.x). I am also worried that this bug might be present in the other drivers."
