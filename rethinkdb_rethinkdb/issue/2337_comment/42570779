      "We just upgraded a development machine to server version 1.12.4 and python driver 1.12.0-1.  We recreated the Token X Not in Stream Cache Exception as soon as we finished deployment.  It looks like you're working on patching the driver in #2364.  Do you think the patch you made for the 1.11 driver would fix this issue for the 1.12 driver?"
