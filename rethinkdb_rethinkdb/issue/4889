        "Added support for select and insert operations on Java bean classes, not only on boxed primitive types, lists and maps. You can select one typed object:\n\n``` java\nPojo pojo = r.db(\"db\").table(\"table\").get(\"reql-expr\").run(conn, Pojo.class);\n```\n\n...or a list of objects:\n\n``` java\nList<Pojo> pojoList = r.db(\"db\").table(\"table\").get(\"reql-expr\").runList(conn, Pojo.class);\n```\n\nObjects are constructed from `Map<String, Object>` instances selected from RethinkDB using reflection. Insertion of typed objects employs the same technique:\n\n``` java\nPojo pojo = new Pojo(\"foo\", new NestedPojo(42L, true));\nr.db(\"db\").table(\"table\").insert(pojo).run(conn);\n```\n\nMerging this code to Java driver would be extremely useful for me and, I presume, to the community, because working with maps and primitives is quite painful in Java.\n\nI bet my code removes a portion of that pain :smile: \n"
