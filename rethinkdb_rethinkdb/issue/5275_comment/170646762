      "Thanks for the issue report @sagivf. I think the correct argument is `\"attempts\"`, and the docs are wrong.\r\n\r\nHowever I'm not sure why `\"attempts\"` is failing for you with the JavaScript driver. I can't find the miss-spelled term `reattemps` in our current code base, so I'm unsure where that's coming from. Maybe that message is generated by `libcurl` somehow? @Tryneus could you look into that please?"
