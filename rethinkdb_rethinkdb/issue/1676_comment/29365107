      "Also @mlucy as best as I can tell the distinction between what you're calling \"postfix\" and what we have now is that you've swapped out the key \"description\" and replaced it with \"task\" and since \"task\" comes after \"sub_tasks\" lexicographically while \"description\" comes before \"sub_tasks\" lexicographically we're assuming that languages are going to render the dict objects in a postfix looking way. It really feels to me like this is getting a bit silly and we'd be a lot better served by figuring out exactly what types of visualizations of this data we want to show users. And then figuring out how to render that information from the profiles. I've already proposed one that's explicitly designed to visualize how much time is spent in each segment of the query and I think it's the best way to make things understandable in the way you guys are talking about."
