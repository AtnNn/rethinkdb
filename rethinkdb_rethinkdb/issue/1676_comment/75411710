      "The more I use rethink the more I end up moving application logic into the query. Subqueries, http requests and the power or ReQL allows huge amounts of processing to be contained into a query. The issue I have is when the query gets so large that it's >20Kb of (no data, just code) ReQL. It's probably high time I backup and try to split things up a bit. Still, I'll see if I can put together a big mess of code to demonstrate slow query-parsing and report back with it."
