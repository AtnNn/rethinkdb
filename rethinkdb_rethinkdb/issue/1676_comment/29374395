      "> I've already proposed one that's explicitly designed to visualize how much time is spent in each segment of the query\r\n\r\nCould you link to it? I can't seem to find it (possibly because I don't know what to search for).\r\n\r\nMy original feeling on infix/prefix data structure actually had to do with a concrete visualization I had in mind. Imagine a vertical axis that denotes time (where the top of the graph is T0, and the bottom of the graph is T+X, where X is the time it took to run the query). I thought it would be difficult for the visualizer code to analyze/transform the current output to get the necessary information. This might be misguided though -- the proper way to do this likely has nothing to do with infixness/prefixness of the output.\r\n\r\nSo, I hereby remove that piece from this issue and agree that we should discuss it in terms of a concrete visualization (which we should probably do in person, since it's hard to do on GitHub). The other parts of the issue still seem relevant, though."
