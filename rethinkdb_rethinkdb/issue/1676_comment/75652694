      "I don't think there's a need for ripping it out and I don't think putting it into the `jobs` table would make for a good user experience (you'd have to query the `jobs` table exactly at the time your query is running, or you'd miss the profile).\r\n\r\nI'm on board with simplifying the profiler output though, and only keeping things that actually work properly.\r\n\r\nArguably the profiler is actually under-engineered, making certain things difficult to track through it (which is why we aren't tracking them and why its output isn't as relevant as it should be for some queries). At some point we'll have to put some thought into it and figure out if we can fix it or if we should instead reduce its scope to have a less powerful but better working profiler."
