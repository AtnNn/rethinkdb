      "@webmasterkai those are huge queries indeed. I can see that that would take considerable time for query parsing (especially with the inefficient way we currently generate backtraces for queries on the server). If you can put something together for us to test that would be great.\r\nI suspect it will become more efficient once we solve https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2900 . It's not a trivial change unfortunately, so that won't make it in before version 2.1."
