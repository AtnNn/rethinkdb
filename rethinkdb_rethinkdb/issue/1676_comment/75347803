      "What about the time it takes to parse the query in the driver and in the db? I have seen several cases of a reported duration of 10ms in the profile output but have it actually take over 150ms from .run() to the return function. It seems changes in the way the query is written (but not its functionality) keep the reported duration within a few ms but change the roundtrip time (up to 700ms) dramatically. Possibly related to #3249."
