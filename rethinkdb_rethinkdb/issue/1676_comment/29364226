      "So the profiles aren't really infix or prefix or any fix. The profiles just represent the path that execution takes. Because we record every time we enter an eval method you get something that tends to look a lot like the query you wrote but if you look closely you'll see there's a lot of little ways that it doesn't match up with any of these notions. It's going to take a huge amount of work to squash these traces in to the form of our query language, and in the process you're going to lose a lot of information. A much more sane thing to do is to attach backtraces to nodes in the profile for which it makes sense and then use that to reconstruct how much time is spent for each segment of the query. "
