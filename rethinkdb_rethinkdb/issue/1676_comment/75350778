      "@webmasterkai Not sure how easy it is to do, but I agree that query parsing at least on the server side would make sense to include.\r\nOut of curiosity: What is the query for which the way you write it makes such a big difference? Does it have any large arrays? (in that case it might be a side-effect of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2919)\r\n\r\nThe profile currently has quite a few omissions and problems, and definitely needs some work to be really reliable."
