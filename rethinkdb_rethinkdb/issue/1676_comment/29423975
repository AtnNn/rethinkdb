      "@jdoliner -- when I was watching @coffeemug read and parse profiles before he left, the single biggest problem for him seemed to be that he would run `tbl.map{...}.reduce{...}`, and then be confused in the output because the string \"map\" came *after* the string \"reduce\".  For example, he would read the profile for map, then scroll down to look for reduce and not be able to find it.  Moving the names to be below their sub-tasks seemed like an easy patch for that problem, but I don't feel too strongly about it."
