        "To implement this interface https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/997#issuecomment-39495690\r\n\r\nWe actually don't need a new type. \r\n\r\nHere's the proposal:\r\n- If the user call `on` on a cursor, we are going to create a recursion like the second snippet on http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/next/ and we will emit an event \"data\" every time we get a row. \r\n- Once you call `on`, we'll add methods like `next`, `toArray` on the cursor object such that people won't be able to use both interfaces.\r\n- We'll add things like `once`, `removeListener`, `removeAllListener` etc.\r\nWe can also add `off` because it's nice and some libraries like Backbone have them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPutting in 1.13 polish."
