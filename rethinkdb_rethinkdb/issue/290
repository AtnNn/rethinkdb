        "I have four instances of rethinkdb running on four separate hosts:\r\n\r\nrdb1, rdb2, rdb3 and rdb4.\r\n\r\nUp to now they have been set up with the following roles:\r\n\r\nrdb1: Primary, hosts 2 tables t1 and t2, unsharded\r\nrdb2: Primary\r\nrdb3: Secondary, hosts replicas of t1 and t2 from rdb1\r\nrdb4: Secondary\r\n\r\nWhen my primary dies and I bring it back up all cluster members show down. If I leave the web UI nothing seems to change until I manually restart one of the other cluster members also.\r\n\r\nIs there a way for me to confirm if this is simply a web UI issue or that the primary does in fact not see the other cluster members?"
