        "Currently it returns the status, which from what I can tell from the discussion on #2259 happened just because it has to return something, so status was a reasonable choice.\r\n\r\nIf it instead returned the table itself, it might be more useful:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.db('foo').table('bar').wait().filter(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you really want the status, you can always do:\r\n```\r\nr.table('bar').wait().status()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has a problem though: you can wait on dbs, and we don't have much you can do with a db object currently. Maybe we should make db objects more useful, or maybe it's ok to be slightly inconsistent and return the status of the tables like it currently does.\r\n\r\n"
