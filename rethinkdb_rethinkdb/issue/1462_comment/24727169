      "The issue should be fixed now. The new version of the node-protobuf package is 1.0.5-0.\r\n\r\nIf you re-run `npm install rethinkdb` you should be able to get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> var r = require('rethinkdb')\r\n> r.protobuf_implementation\r\n'cpp'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you get errors such as these:\r\n\r\n```\r\n../protobuf.cpp:7:45: warning: google/protobuf/dynamic_message.h: No such file or directory\r\n../protobuf.cpp:8:40: warning: google/protobuf/descriptor.h: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may first need to run `yum install protobuf-devel`.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue. Thanks for the report. I opened issue #1463 to make the installation process easier."
