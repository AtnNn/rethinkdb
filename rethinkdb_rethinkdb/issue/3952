Can anyone explain why this query doesn't seem to use an index and can take 10-20 seconds to run.\n\n``` javascript\nr.db('ijoin')\n  .table('plans')\n\n  // One-To-Many\n  .map(function (parent) {\n\n    return parent.merge({\n      investmentVehicles: r.db('ijoin')\n          .table('investmentVehicles')\n          .getAll(parent('id'), { index: 'planId' })\n          .coerceTo('array')\n    });\n  })\n\n  .count()\n```\n\n...but this one appears to work fine and easily counts 20,000+ records in 50ms?\n\n``` javascript\nr.db('ijoin')\n  .table('plans')\n\n  // One-To-Many\n  .map(function (parent) {\n\n    return parent.merge({\n      investmentVehicles: []\n    });\n  })\n\n  .count()\n```\n"
