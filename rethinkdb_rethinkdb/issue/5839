        "Dumping and restoring has been fixed for Windows, provided that the `dump` occurs on Windows.\r\n\r\nMy issue is that I have a development template DB dumped from Mac/Linux that I would like to restore on Windows. Now I'm still having the old issue, ref: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5505 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5399\r\n\r\nI understand not wanting to change the default dump naming scheme for Mac/Linux to preserve any scripts that may depend on it.\r\n\r\nCould there be a flag or naming option that uses a format friendly for all platforms? Even when I specify the filename and db with `-e` and `-f`, `dump` still nests a folder with the timestamp that breaks restore on Windows. There should be some solution that doesn't involve manually extracting, renaming, then recompressing the dump file."
