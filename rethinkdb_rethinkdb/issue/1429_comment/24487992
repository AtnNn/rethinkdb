      "I'm not sure it's that commit which is broken.  If that were broken, I don't think we'd see odd errors where a secondary index is accessed before it was finished being constructed -- we'd see different errors.  It might have broken things by the nature of some side effect, like serializing things to a smaller value, causing timing issues to come into play."
