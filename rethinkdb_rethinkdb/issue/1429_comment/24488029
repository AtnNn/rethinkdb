      "As far as I can tell, the SindexPostConstruction test doesn't randomize its behavior.  A bug in serialization or deserialization of numbers would exhibit itself much more widely than one unit test.  I'm moving this back to milestone 1.9.x.  I'm going to make some tests for datum serialization in sam_1429_datum_serialization_tests in the meantime."
