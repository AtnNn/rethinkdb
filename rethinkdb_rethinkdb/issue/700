        "Currently it's very easy for anyone to break next (just merge some broken code), which makes Travis tests useless. I propose the following automated merging scheme instead:\n1. Nobody merges into next manually\n2. When you're ready to merge into next, you submit a request to an automated system to merge your branch (something like `pleasemerge slava_999`)\n3. The automated system ensures that a) `slava_999` is a fast-forward off next, and b) `slava_999` ran through a travis build and passed. If both of these conditions hold true, it merges `slava_999` into next. If either of these conditions is false, it tells the user it won't merge.\n\nThis will make it _much_ harder to accidentally break next, and it seems very easy to do.\n"
