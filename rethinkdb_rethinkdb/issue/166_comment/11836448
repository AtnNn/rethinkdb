      "> Ok, I've decided to remove this error message entirely and have workers die silently if they hit an unexpected end-of-file [...] This ties into issue #69, which should add visibility when a worker process fails, and have the ability to restart them as needed. I think we will be fine without this log statement until then.\r\n\r\n:+1: \r\n"
