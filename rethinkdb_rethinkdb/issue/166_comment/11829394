      "So, this is also back on Linux, because getppid() will only let us know once the parent is dead.  After a brief search, I can't see a simple programmatic way of determining if the parent process is dying on OSX, so we either live with this error message or have it silently fail.  As for Linux, we can either keep the same behavior as on OSX, or have some linux-specific code to check the parent process's state.  I'm not sure what I'll choose yet, all the options kind of suck."
