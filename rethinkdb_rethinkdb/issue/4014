        "We have most administrative functions now available thorugh Reql, but not the ability to shut down the server. There are a couple of places in testing where this would be nice (allowing more things to be handled in YAML tests), and I could see how it would be a nice feature for third party management consoles.\r\n\r\nI talked with @danielmewes briefly about this, and he thought that one way of doing this would be to add a \"running\" entry to the servers pseudo-table that would be \"true\". If you set this to \"false\" that server would shut down. Of course there would be no way of restarting that server from the same interface."
