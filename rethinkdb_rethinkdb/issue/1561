        "Hello, I'm writing a clojure driver for rethinkdb and I have a question:\r\n\r\nin the python driver documentation you have this query\r\n\r\n    r.table('marvel').update(\r\n        lambda x: {'age': x['age'] + r.js('1')}, non_atomic=True).run(conn)\r\n\r\nI was wondering what does this:\r\n\r\n    {'age': x['age'] + r.js('1')}\r\n\r\ncompile to.\r\n\r\nAFAIK it can't be a `Datum` of type `R_OBJECT`with `r_object: [{type: AssocPair ....}]` because `AssocPair` only takes `String` + `Datum` as elements and the result of `x['age'] + r.js('1')` is a `Term`. So how do you compile that? "
