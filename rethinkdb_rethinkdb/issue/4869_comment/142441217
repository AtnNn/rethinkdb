      "More on the class variable point, you'd have to use a class object attribute accessor instead of a class variable, i.e. ``@@default_conn``. Class variables are like global variables. Sub-classes inherit the same class variable as the parent. Read more here: http://www.sitepoint.com/class-variables-a-ruby-gotcha/\r\n\r\nUsing a class object ``attr_accessor`` (which is backed by an instance variable) should work as desired:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nclass RQL\r\n  class << self\r\n    attr_accessor :default_conn\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```"
