      "Oh I see. I think we should handle the case where `sys.stdout.encoding` doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nI found this thread which is about a related issue where LoggingProxy doesn't provide a proper `fileno()` on `stdout` https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/928 .\r\n\r\nThe conclusion seems to be that Python doesn't require anything else but a `write()` method on `sys.stdout`, though the documentation is a bit ambiguous (https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.stdin)"
