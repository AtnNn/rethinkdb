      "Just for the record: I simulated full memory by having `while true; do sleep 0.05; (echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches); done` run while the benchmark was running, and by using a 2 MB cache-size for RethinkDB. That way most reads had to hit disk, and I could measure the overhead for actually reading from disk with direct vs. buffered i/o.\r\nI know this is hacky, but it seems good enough to detect big inefficiencies (like the read-ahead one)."
