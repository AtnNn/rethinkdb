      "What is the easiest way to test if `--direct-io` works reliably, and makes a difference? It would be nice if there was a simple (python?) script to run. The servers have 64GB RAM, and SSD with ~140k IOPS.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find anything in the documentation about the `--direct-io` option besides the one line in command line option description, and some _old_ blog articles just briefly mentioning it."
