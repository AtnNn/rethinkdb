      "@analytic To give you a data point, I've not personally seen a single system + workload combination for which `--direct-io` was faster, including some with NVMe storage. There normally isn't much reason to turning it on.\r\n\r\nI think a generic testing script wouldn't be much good, because it would likely not reflect the same load pattern that your actual workload will put on the I/o subsystem."
