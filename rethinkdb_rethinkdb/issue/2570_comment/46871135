      "I am not sure it's such a big and reccuring problem in the nodejs world. Only a matter of drivers\r\nhandling connections, so maybe some big driver community projects.\r\n\r\nBut do not expect one of the JS gurus to give you an advice on this, I think @neumino handled this well in his own rethinkdbdash and we should agree on taking his idea into the new driver.\r\n\r\nSo that no more JS developers come to the rethinkdb driver and think: \"FUUU what's this madness around connection handling\" :)"
