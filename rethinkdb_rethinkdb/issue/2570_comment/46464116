      "> There was a discussion of letting run handle a promise (see #1395 (comment)) but it seems like a bad idea to me, you shouldn't use a promise like a \"future\"\r\n\r\nI see, can you think of potential problems it could bring to let run handle the promise?\r\n\r\nThe provided example from @AtnNn in #1395 looks great:\r\n\r\n    c = r.connect();\r\n    query.run(c);\r\n\r\n\r\n"
