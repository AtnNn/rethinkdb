      "My bad, I made a mistake.\r\n\r\nI thought that you could call `then` only once a promise, but I just tried and it's not the case, you can call `then` multiple times. Looking at [the specs](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/) (2.2.6) it's expected.\r\n\r\nSo what I wrote works fine and I actually don't have any strong objection left.\r\nI still thinks it's weird, and I'm worried that we are doing something strange (we basically hide some asynchronous operations).  \r\nBut I can implement it since it's pretty easy to do.\r\n\r\nThere is one last little things that I'm not sure about.\r\nIf you do something like\r\n```\r\nvar c = r.connect();\r\nsetImmediate(function() { // or any async operation\r\n   query.run(c)\r\n})\r\n```\r\nAnd suppose that `r.connect` fails (like if you connect to the wrong port), you get a log `Possibly unhandled RqlDriverError. Could not connect to localhost:28015.\r\nconnect ECONNREFUSED` printed in the console.\r\nBut that's kind of an edge case, so we could probably ignore it.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
