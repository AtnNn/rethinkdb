      "> Implementing close, noreplyWait on top of a promise seems like a bad idea too. It's just going to make things more and more confusing.\r\n> \r\n> To improve run, we should just add a default connection pool in the driver like in rethinkdbdash.\r\n> That seems like a better solution to me.\r\n\r\nYes given your well thought example it seems that the second option is a better choice (a lot better).\r\n\r\nThis issue and the comments still shows that something is wrong with the driver and your proposal of having a default connection pool seems better.\r\n\r\n"
