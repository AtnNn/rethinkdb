Would you mind commenting in that thread with the requirements you have for the primary key generation scheme?\r\n\r\nFor the moment, I'd recommend generating the keys explicitly on the client when inserting data. The server isn't doing anything special with its UUIDs (it just picks a random one when evaluating the insert)."
