        "There is no in-system warning currently to make users aware that a two-server table/shard configuration does not auto-failover. Regardless of what we tell users in the docs, we should also warn them of the downsides of this setup both when they `reconfigure` to get into this setup, and when a table is in this state. For the latter something like a warning icon on the `Tables` page, and a banner on the detail page for that table would work.\r\n\r\nAfter a bit of in-person conversation with @VeXocide and @Tryneus we decided that this would best be done only in the WebUI, and not appear anywhere on the command line or in `rethinkdb.issues`, mostly to target the users who are most likely to stumble on this without annoying power users with non-dismissible issues.\r\n\r\nThis is a takeoff on [this comment](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5245#issuecomment-169173223) by @samkelleher."
