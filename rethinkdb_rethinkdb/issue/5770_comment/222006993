      "Cool, I think in both cases RethinkDB is working as expected then.\r\n\r\n@artdude543 we're happy to discuss alternative setups with you or check which configuration changes are necessary to get things up with Scaleway. This would fall into the range of our commercial support offerings though. Please contact us via http://rethinkdb.com/services/ or drop me an email to daniel@rethinkdb.com if you'd like to explore that option.\r\nAlternatively someone might be able to give you some pointers in our Slack channel. You can easily sign up for it at http://slack.rethinkdb.com/ ."
