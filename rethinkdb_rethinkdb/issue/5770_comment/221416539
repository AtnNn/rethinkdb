      "As far as I know the queries were working but we had the error on the panel about the servers not being connected to each other.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming I'll need to add external IP's to the other servers? I moved to Scalway to cut down on costs such as IP's but nothing major if it's needed. I thought using the internal network would be sufficient. Unless I'm missing something with the config on the proxy / cluster."
