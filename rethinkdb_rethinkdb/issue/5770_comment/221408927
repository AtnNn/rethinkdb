      "I'm getting the same issue on a new cluster setup of which I did not have on my old cluster setup. I use Scaleway for the servers and have the master which has an external IP and the other machines use the internal DNS to connect to the master. The proxy then uses the main IP to connect.\r\n\r\nOn our old setup which worked fine with no issues. On the server stats the main server shows as connected to the proxy but the \"sub\" servers show as not connected to the proxy.\r\n\r\nNot really sure how to fix this due to not having the issue before hand."
