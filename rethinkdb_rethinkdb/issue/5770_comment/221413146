      "@artdude543 Note that this issue wasn't detected / displayed before RethinkDB 2.3. So the issue might have been there, but you wouldn't have noticed it under certain circumstances (though the proxies would still be unable to reach any primaries on the non-connected servers).\r\n\r\nAre queries actually failing now?\r\n\r\nIn general the proxy needs to be able to connect to all servers in the cluster, not just one. If the Scaleway configuration exposes only a single IP and the other servers' IPs aren't accessible from the proxies, that setup cannot work. It might work in practice as long as all primary replicas are on the server that the proxies can reach, but queries run through the proxy will fail as soon as that's no longer the case (e.g. in case of a failover)."
