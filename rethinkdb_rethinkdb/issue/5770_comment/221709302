      "As mentioned things will work as long as the proxy is connected to the server that is a primary for all replicas. Once you shard the tables or an automatic failover happens queries run through the proxy will no longer work.\r\n\r\nThe RethinkDB cluster connectivity architecture just doesn't currently support setups like this. Every server and every proxy node must be able to connect directly to each other to establish full connectivity."
