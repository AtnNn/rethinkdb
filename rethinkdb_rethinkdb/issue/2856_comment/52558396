      "It's illegal to ask for replicas on two tags that share a server. So when you asked for one replica on `tag1`, the server would reject that change.\r\n\r\nI guess I don't understand the problem with auto-failover. If the death of a server causes the goals to be unsatisfiable, we should satisfy whatever we can and show the user an issue. Where is the problem?"
