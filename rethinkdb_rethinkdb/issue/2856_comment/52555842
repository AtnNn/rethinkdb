      "@timmaxw -- Yes, but that doesn't mean they are useful for users.\r\n\r\nI have a few issues with tags:\r\n\r\n- It's harder to represent, and to visualize\r\n- Increasing the number of replica for a tag can add a replica on a machine that doesn't have the tag.\r\n- It can lead to unsatisfiable goals that we can't automatically solve -- how is failover going to deal with that?"
