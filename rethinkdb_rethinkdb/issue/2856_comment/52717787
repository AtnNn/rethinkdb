      "But you can't actually take advantage of tags like that. For example, suppose you want to have the primary and one replica in `us_east`, and another replica in `us_west`, but you only want to use high-reliability servers. The only way to get that under the current scheme is to have tags `us_east_high_reliability` and `us_west_high_reliability`; there's no way to specify the intersection of two tags.\r\n\r\nWe could conceivably add Boolean operations on tags. So you could specify the replication settings as `{\"us_east&high_reliability\": 2, \"us_west&high_reliability\": 1}`."
