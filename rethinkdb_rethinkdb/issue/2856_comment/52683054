      "I'm even more confused now.\r\n\r\nAren't tag something on the high level API?\r\nCan they produce unsatisfiable goals? If I request 2 replicas on tag1 and have two machines, but later kill one, what happens?\r\nIf people can't change replicas if a tag overlaps with another, what's the point of having tags?\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll come ask you a few question in person, I think I'm missing a few things here."
