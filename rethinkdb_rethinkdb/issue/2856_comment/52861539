      "The operation would need to know what settings the admin wanted for `table.reconfigure()`. Not all admins would even use `table.reconfigure()`; they might have set the previous config using the low-level API, in which case there's nothing we could do.\r\n\r\nThe admin also needs to know what the server removal function is doing under the hood anyway. If they assign other tables to the server while the old tables are being offloaded, then that will defeat the purpose.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, retiring a server is a fairly uncommon operation; it's mostly for advanced users; and the above procedure isn't actually that bad."
