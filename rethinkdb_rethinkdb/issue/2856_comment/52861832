      "If we can mark a server as 'being deleted', we can make sure it doesn't assume any more responsibilities.  Even if retiring a server is uncommon, for that kind of process you would need a checklist, which is very user unfriendly, mostly because if you screw it up you could be looking at loss of availability in the best case or loss of data in the worst."
