      "What if we scrap server tags completely? Most users will consider all of their servers equivalent for replication purposes; i.e. they'll be perfectly happy to call `table.reconfigure(4,2)` without specifying any per-tag settings. Advanced users can write a tool that manipulates `rethinkdb.table_config`.\r\n\r\nIf we keep server tags, I think we should de-emphasize them as much as possible, and present them as an advanced feature. For example, when the user clicks \"Reconfigure\" in the web UI, it should start by just showing them options for how many shards and how many replicas. They should have to click \"Advanced...\" or something to see per-tag settings. Maybe we should even forbid server tag manipulation in the web UI, and tell people to use the ReQL API."
