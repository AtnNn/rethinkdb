      "> Maybe the `default` tag shouldn't be assigned when tags are explicitly specified?\r\n\r\nI think that would be a reasonable option. It might be a little surprising to the user, but I think I've seen other software that works that way, so it might be OK. Also, there's no way to start a server with no tags, although the user could work around that by starting the server with a tag they'll never use."
