      "The `default` tag is mostly for new users who don't want to think about tags. The goal is that if someone starts one or more equivalent machines and creates a table, it should \"just work\". The way we accomplish this is by tagging every server `default` and then having `r.table_create()` and `r.table().reconfigure()` use servers with the `default` tag by default.\r\n\r\nOne alternative would be to get rid of the `default` tag, and have `r.table_create()` and `r.table().reconfigure()` use all servers by default."
