        "I'm using CentOS as my server and have both sysvinit and upstart, the default for RethinkDB is the sysvinit but unforuntately the service crashes sometimes and due to the cache definitions may take too much ram and die later. Right now I need to come in manually and restart it in such cases and upstart would just restart the service back again increasing the availability.\n\nPlease provide an upstart script that can just be dropped in, the sysvinit script seems rather complex to just be simply converted with no thought.\n"
