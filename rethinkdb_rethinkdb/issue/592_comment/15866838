      "Sorry, please move this to rethinkdb-www.\r\n\r\nThe API page seemed slightly different because it touched upon the doc changes we made in main and in my head is so intertwined with rethinkdb itself. I'd prefer to keep that issue here, but if people feel strongly it should be moved, I won't stay in their way. Other website related issues should definitely be in -www, though."
