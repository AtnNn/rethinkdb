      "We intentionally made this decision, like @deontologician said.\r\n\r\nI think it's ok to allow additional things using ReQL commands that are not possible through the web UI. The main scenario for which more shards than servers are useful is for testing purposes on our end. In practice is almost never makes sense to do this, and will likely result in reduced performance.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this, but let me know if you think there's a better way in which we should handle this @dalanmiller ."
