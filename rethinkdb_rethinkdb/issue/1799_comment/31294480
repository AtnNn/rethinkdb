      "@coffeemug the multiple choice error stuff came from when i was in the admin ui and i was trying to change the replication settings. At this time the UI was not showing me a vector clock issue BUT changing settings put that error into the log file and crashed the entire rethinkdb process.\r\n\r\nthe vector clock error came into effect because one machine had dont pin master, and the other machine said pin table master to me when they joined up."
