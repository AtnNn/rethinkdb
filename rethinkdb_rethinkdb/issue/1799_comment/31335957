      "> Last time we talked about that (pre 1.2), I think we agreed on forbidding user to use both mode at the same time (per datacenter, and on the cluster), but we didn't do it because we had to ship.\r\n\r\nI think we didn't do it because there were fundamental objections based on the underlying metadata propagation model, not because we had to ship. I agree that we should revisit this decision now that we have a lot more information.\r\n\r\nI also think we should carefully consider how we define \"replica\" so that the web UI never has to do the trick of adding/subtracting one in order to make things work. I think there will be a bit of fine-tuning we'll have to do to *really* nail the operations aspect of RethinkDB, and this is an opportunity to make changes and get things right based on additional information we now have (#1792 is one such source of information).\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure where this lands on our product roadmap yet, but I think it's quite important so I'm leaving it in subsequent for now."
