      "@neumino overall i have been able to fix the problem. The really problem came that both sides of the network paration had a full working copy of the data but none of them wanted to give me access to the other half. Even though in one of them i marked the server as permanently dead.\r\n\r\nThe other important problem is when trying to change the replica values on the web ui would crash the server also. \r\n\r\n"
