      "@coffeemug -- there are a lot of sub-issues here which shouldn't necessarily be done together, and I think at least one of those issues should be in 1.11.x rather than subsequent.  Would you mind breaking this out into its sub-components, with at least one issue in 1.11.x to fix the crashing bug?"
