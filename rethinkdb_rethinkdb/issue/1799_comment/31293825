      "@coffeemug \r\n\r\nYeah i understand the way the pinning works what made this so frustrating is on the secondary machine i removed the pinning but for the life of me i was not able to get the machine to share its data. Even on the machine that was suppose to be the master The data was not available. This took several hours lots of poking around and playing with replication shettings getting both machiens back together changing the settings back to what they where and then the data came back with the vector clock errors. Which one was able to be solved on the admin ui but the second one kept crashing the javascript.\r\n\r\nThe crash was just a simple oom "
