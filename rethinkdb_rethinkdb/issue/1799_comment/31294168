      "Ok, I replicated a part of the issue. The flow is actually really surprising and hard to figure out if you move machines between datacenters after the replica count has been set on the table. When you declare a machine dead we do show unsatisfiable goals, but it's surprisingly difficult to figure out how to satisfy them. We'll talk about how to fix this internally once we get to this issue.\r\n\r\nCould you describe the steps you used to get to a vector clock conflict? I can't reproduce this part."
