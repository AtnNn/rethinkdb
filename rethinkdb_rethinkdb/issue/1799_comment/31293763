      "Ahhh, I see. This is actually by design -- if you declare a datacenter as primary for a given table, no machines in other datacenters will get elected as master for that table. We should publish an issue for this (probably unsatisfiable goals) if we don't already. We'll check when we get to this.\r\n\r\nWould you mind also listing the steps on how you got to a crash?"
