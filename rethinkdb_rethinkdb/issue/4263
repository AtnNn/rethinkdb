        "It appears that deleting documents, even something as simple as deleting all documents in a table by just doing `table.delete.run`, is orders of magnitude slower than batch inserts.  This makes use of RethinkDB unfeasible in uses cases where there is a need to maintain a rolling set of documents in a table, such a time series, but where batch insert performance is the only mechanism to capable of inserting document at a sufficiently high rate.  Without being able to delete documents at the same rate as the batch inserts, the table would grown unbounded."
