      "I'd like to be able to say:\r\n\r\n    table.filter(row[\"locations\"].intersects([1,2,3])).\r\n\r\nAlso I think another cool idea would be extending the object filter syntax\r\n`(this one: table.filter({\"a\" : 1}))` a bit.\r\nRight now all you can pass to it is value which we then compare for\r\nequality to the corresponding value. We could also allow passing partially\r\nevaluated functions. So then you could say things like this:\r\n\r\n    table.filter({\"locations\" : intersects([1,2,3])})\r\n\r\nWhich uses the value of `row[\"locations\"]` as the second argument to\r\nintersects.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Fri, Jan 25, 2013 at 8:48 AM, Alex Popescu <notifications@github.com>wrote:\r\n\r\n> @coffeemug <https://github.com/coffeemug> the solution proposed on the\r\n> Google Group1<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rethinkdb/Z-UPiP7IPYY/discussion>is still ugly.
