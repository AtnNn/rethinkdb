      "The second bug @tryneus observed is independent of the first (which seems fixed by b3323a96a1cb778ccc9f242651b9f5b0d6a02c10 in branch sam_666).\r\n\r\n`rdb_modification_report_cb_t::on_mod_report` is trying to atomically check if sindex_block is acquired and then acquire sindex_block if necessary.  Its code is not actually atomic, though, and multiple `on_mod_report` calls made simultaneously would cause multiple waiters on the write token to be made, when acquire_sindex_block_for_write expects itself to be the only waiter."
