      "It happened in release and I haven't seen it yet in debug, but I haven't been trying to reproduce it.  I would bet that if you build release with SYMBOLS=1 and point a bunch of ruby clients doing big inserts at it that it will happen again.  (I can also try to reproduce it myself when I'm done with other things.)"
