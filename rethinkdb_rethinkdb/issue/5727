        "r.table('xyz').getAll([1,2]) - in data explorer displays - \"No results returned.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly in python - r.table('xyz').get_all([1,2]).run(con).next() - results in error message saying cursor is empty.\r\n\r\nThe feature is important as one can define the list of values in a variable and pass the variable to getAll like -\r\n\r\nx=[1,2]\r\nr.table('xyz').getAll(x) \r\n\r\nWhat works: r.table('xyz').getAll(1,2) - works. This means that getAll currently accepts comma separated values but does not accept list of values.\r\n\r\nNote: Table 'xyz' contains a primary_key which has values 1,2,3,... This behaviour is same for secondary index. \r\n\r\nNote2: pluck does accept list of column names as input which makes life a lot easier.   \r\n\r\nUpdate: I understood the problem in giving out the feature. The list is supposed to be used with a compound index. The get around would be to allow a list of list or a tuple as input for getAll for a simple index for plucking particular rows from the database."
