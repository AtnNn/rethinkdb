      "I think we should offer 'milestone' releases for well-defined upgrade paths - these should probably coincide with the LTS releases.  Then, it would be very easy to support upgrades from all versions since the previous milestone up until the next milestone.\r\n\r\nOn a personal note, it would make my life much easier in the no-protobuf branch if we could drop support for pre-1.16 in 2.1."
