        "> r.time(2016, 1, 1, 'Z').sub(r.time(2015, 1, 1, 'Z'))\r\n\r\nI'm really happy to have the date subtraction capability - because I need it.  :)  But it would be great if I could specify something like:\r\n\r\n    r.diff(r.time(2016, 1, 1, 'Z'), r.time(2015, 1, 1, 'Z'), 'd')\r\n\r\nto get the difference in days.  Right now I have to write this:\r\n\r\n    r.floor(r.time(2016, 1, 1, 'Z').sub(r.time(2015, 1, 1, 'Z'))).div(86400))\r\n\r\nArguably, that is not horrible, but having a smart & flexible date difference function would be quite handy and easier to digest than specifying time constants in the query.\r\n\r\nOur friends at ArangoDB offer a nice DATE_DIFF function.\r\n\r\n> DATE_DIFF(date1, date2, unit, asFloat): Calculate the difference between two dates in given time  unit, optionally with decimal places. Returns a negative value if date1 is greater than / after date2.\r\n>\r\n> unit can be either of the following to specify the time unit to return the difference in (case- insensitive):\r\n>\r\n> y, year, years\r\n> m, month, months\r\n> w, week, weeks\r\n> d, day, days\r\n> h, hour, hours\r\n> i, minute, minutes\r\n> s, second, seconds\r\n> f, millisecond, milliseconds"
