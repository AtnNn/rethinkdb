        "> r.time(2016, 1, 1, 'Z').sub(r.time(2015, 1, 1, 'Z'))\n\nI'm really happy to have the date subtraction capability - because I need it.  :)  But it would be great if I could specify something like:\n\n```\nr.diff(r.time(2016, 1, 1, 'Z'), r.time(2015, 1, 1, 'Z'), 'd')\n```\n\nto get the difference in days.  Right now I have to write this:\n\n```\nr.floor(r.time(2016, 1, 1, 'Z').sub(r.time(2015, 1, 1, 'Z'))).div(86400))\n```\n\nArguably, that is not horrible, but having a smart & flexible date difference function would be quite handy and easier to digest than specifying time constants in the query.\n\nOur friends at ArangoDB offer a nice DATE_DIFF function.\n\n> DATE_DIFF(date1, date2, unit, asFloat): Calculate the difference between two dates in given time  unit, optionally with decimal places. Returns a negative value if date1 is greater than / after date2.\n> \n> unit can be either of the following to specify the time unit to return the difference in (case- insensitive):\n> \n> y, year, years\n> m, month, months\n> w, week, weeks\n> d, day, days\n> h, hour, hours\n> i, minute, minutes\n> s, second, seconds\n> f, millisecond, milliseconds\n"
