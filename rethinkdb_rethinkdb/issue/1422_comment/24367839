      "I can confirm that I have run this successfully on 12.04LTS-ubuntu-server non-VPS machine with 4gb of ram. I, unfortunately do not have any VPS'es which have more ram; they are too expensive.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that the hosting provider has played with the distribution image; as someone mentioned the kernel version was unexpected."
