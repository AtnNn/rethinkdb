      "For what it's worth, RethinkDB runs fine on default installation of Ubuntu 10.04 Server edition in 128 MB of memory.\r\n\r\nWe don't consider it a bug to run out of resources on systems with low resource limits.  If you can change the default stack size on your system, changing it to 2 GB should work [1].  If not, I recommend running rethinkdb with `--io-threads 5`, or maybe 3 or 4.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't change our recommendation that you run RethinkDB with at least 2 GB of memory -- right now the default cache size of tables is bigger than 256 MB, and you'll want to set it to a low value on every table you create (using the cache_size option in r.table_create, or the appropriate option in the admininistrative UIs).  Things will be easier for low-memory users in version 1.10 when issue #97 makes it in (and also #1425 would be nice).  These are scheduled for version 1.10.\r\n\r\n[1] Beware, IANAL and I'm not qualified to give advice about changing resource limits on production systems.\r\n"
