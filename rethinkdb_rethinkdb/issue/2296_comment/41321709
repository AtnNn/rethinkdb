      "The reason for that is that it lets the server distinguish between times and strings.  This is useful because:\r\n* Some operations are overloaded on times and strings (`+` for example).\r\n* It lets us turn it into a native time type when we send it back to the driver.\r\n\r\nThe server does support ISO 8601 times with the `r.iso8601` term, so if your times happen to be stored that way you can still work with them in ReQL."
