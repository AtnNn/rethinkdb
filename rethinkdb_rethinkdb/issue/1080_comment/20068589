      "Batched inserts would be about equivalent having batching in the scheduler. Assuming it gives a similar boost it would make me very dubious of the batched scheduler change. The batched backend change hurts single client performance and thus most people's first impressions while only helping the case in which you've got multiple concurrent clients but are only sending a single document at a time. This case seems pretty uncommon to me since user will probably only have multiple clients if they're trying to get better performance and I'd expect people to add batching before they add a thread pool because it's so much easier."
