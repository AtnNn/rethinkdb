      "Prioritizing first impressions over other numbers is really not the same as \"shoot people in the back when they would start getting some load on their production systems later on.\" It's obviously a trade off in which both numbers matter. But the reality is we've gotten several complaints about performance from people. And several people who have just given up on the product due to performance and in basically every case I've observed these weren't people who were using multiple threads or batching. Increasing the percentage of people who have this experience even a little bit is actually very costly for us."
