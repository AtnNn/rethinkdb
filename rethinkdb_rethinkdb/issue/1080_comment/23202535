      "Moving this to 1.9-required.  The numbers @danielmewes originally reported are really bad, and I think multiple clients issuing point writes with hard durability is probably a pretty common workload.  (The latency is by far the worst part.)\r\n\r\nI'm getting about 14 writes/sec/client on our setup with 10 clients and a rotational drive.  (That goes up to about 100 writes/sec/client on an SSD, which still isn't fantastic.)\r\n\r\nI sort of lost track of this discussion (and some of it is over my head).  @srh -- are there one or more good fixes for this that we could implement for 1.9?"
