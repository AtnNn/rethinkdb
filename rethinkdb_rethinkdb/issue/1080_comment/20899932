      "I'm aware of the spinning around issue due to the write serialization involved. However writing the metablock to the data extent would allow the disks NCQ to merge it with data writes from other concurrent commits (i.e. from other hash shards), which is relevant to this issue.\r\n\r\nChecksumming all blocks and verifying which state is the latest consistent one on startup would be nice, but I think that would involve considerable implementation effort."
