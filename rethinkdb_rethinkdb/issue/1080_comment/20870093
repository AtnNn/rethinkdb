      "I've thought about this a bit more (and did a few more experiments). I think that this and write performance on rotational drives in general could be drastically improved if we could write the metablocks \"inline\", that is into the data extent. That way we would very significantly decrease the number of random disk seeks when writing. As far as I see, that could actually be the easiest solution to this problem.\r\n\r\nI will later open a separate issue for this, as I think that it is a good idea in general. I will explain more why exactly this would be useful and how I think it should be implemented..."
