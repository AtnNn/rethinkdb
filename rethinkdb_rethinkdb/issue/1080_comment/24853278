      "My current impression is that we can solve this by\r\n1. Implementing #1471\r\n2. Implementing #1470 (*Update*: Implemented)\r\n3. Reducing LBA_SHARD_FACTOR to 1 (*Update*: Likely unnecessary in combination with #1470)\r\n4. Figuring out while we are still probably only going to merge 4-5 write queries into one writeback, even though we could be merging 10. This might be totally ok (maybe the clients just have too much latency and were sending the requests too slowly in my tests), or it could be a question of fine-tuning, or there could be latencies in the query processing prior to where the btree and cache get involved."
