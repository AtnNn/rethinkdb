      "Out of curiosity, I also repeated the same experiment on an SSD. This is the same 50/50 reads/writes YCSB benchmark. For both DBs caches were pre-heated by running the workload twice and measuring the second run. Please note that this is not an overly serious benchmark. I did not put any work into tuning the system config for either DB.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#clients    RethinkDB    MongoDB\r\n  1          261 qps       54 qps\r\n 10          764 qps      525 qps\r\n 50         2411 qps      537 qps\r\n100         3790 qps      (ran out of connection semaphores, some problem with the YCSB client, reports 1430)\r\n```\r\n...not too shabby!"
