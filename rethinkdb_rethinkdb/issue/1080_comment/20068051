      "@jdoliner I haven't tried that. This is the default YCSB workload, which uses updates on single documents. I guess I could use a different test with batched inserts (or updates on multiple documents at once). Would that likely tell us anything about the cause of the problem?\r\n\r\nI thought I would next look at the perfmons. They might contain some interesting metrics for these kind of things (such as average number of blocks per writeback etc)."
