      "@jdoliner: I agree about everything except for \"Increasing the percentage of people who have this experience even a little bit is actually very costly for us.\". Increasing it by 1 % while decreasing the number of people getting terrible performance in production by 50 % sounds like an excellent trade-off to me.\r\n\r\nBut anyways, we don't even know yet if there will be any trade-off in the solutions we might come up with at all. Just that our scalability is clearly not acceptable on rotational drives at the moment and that we have to do something about that."
