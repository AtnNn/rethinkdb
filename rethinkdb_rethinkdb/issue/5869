        "Is it possible to have a unique field in a table `accounts` like `username` and `email`?\r\n\r\nThe only post I could find was from 3 years ago (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17789123/how-to-create-unique-items-in-rethinkdb). Seems like a rudimentary thing as I'm starting a project with rethink because of its live change feeds. But if there's no way to get past creating a unique username then I don't know if this is the right db for me."
