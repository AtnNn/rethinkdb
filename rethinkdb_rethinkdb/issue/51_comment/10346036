      "I think the solution we have in python is pretty nice right now. Any table can be explicitly specified as read out dated or not. And a default for all tables can be set in run. People who think of running things in outdated mode will find a flag on run where the expect and people who need something more powerful have it too.\r\n\r\nEither way since we've also already released this accident and the drivers all support it (excepting js which doesn't support out dated at all) we should keep it around."
