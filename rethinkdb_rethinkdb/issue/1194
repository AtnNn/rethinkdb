I need to work with @neumino to integrate the new code into the data explorer and @atnnn to ensure that the new build steps are properly configured (we unfortunately now need to depend on two more npm based build dependencies).\r\n\r\nAt least #1164 and #1047 should be solved once this is closed as well."
