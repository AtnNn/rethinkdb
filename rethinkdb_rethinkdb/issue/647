        "Some people complained about the new behavior of the data explorer (See #569)\r\n\r\nThe last one was @Tryneus that found strange that if you select some text and hit single/double quote you wrap your selection if quotes.\r\n\r\nDisabling/enabling electric punctuation should be pretty easy to do. The code is well contained.\r\n\r\nThe question left is how are we going to expose this feature to the user. So far I can think of two acceptable ways\r\n- An icon with a gear that show a drowdown menu like we have on the server/datacenter/database/table view where user can select options (like we could select tags on github before their updates)\r\n- A string to execute in the data explorer that would toggle options of display a view where they can toggle options (like with chrome when you go to chrome://whateversetting)\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky any thoughts?\r\n\r\nI have to finish #207 first but that the next issue on my list (with #615 and #584)"
