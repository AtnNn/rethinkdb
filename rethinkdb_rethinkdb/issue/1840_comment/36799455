      "Even though the stack trace looks different on this one, I'm 90% sure that it is another instance of #1789 and has been fixed in 1.11.3.\r\nLooking at this specific stack trace, the issue definitely can no longer happen in this form because we don't invoke `rdb_value_deleter_t::delete_value()` during secondary index dropping anymore (the fact that we did invoke it was the cause of #1789).\r\n\r\nClosing.\r\n\r\n@linuxdynasty Should you encounter problems like this again with RethinkDB 1.11.3 or later, please feel free to re-open the issue."
