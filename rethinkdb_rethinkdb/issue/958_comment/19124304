      "There shouldn't be any conflict if people have less/handlebars/coffee-script installed on their machine.\r\n\r\nBasically handlebars/less/coffeescripts are just little scripts. We don't have to copy them in `/usr/bin` or whatever usual directory.\r\n\r\nThe only disadvantage that I can see for now is that our repository will be a little bigger."
