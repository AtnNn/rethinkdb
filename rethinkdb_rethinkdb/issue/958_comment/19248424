It's the same kind of requirement as protoc.\nI think having internet access should be the normal case (and offline \ncase should be the exception with workaround present).\n\n> behind a firewall or proxy will have trouble building rethinkdb, and our\n> launchpad builds would fail because the build farm is not connected to\n> the internet.\n\nFor the farm, one can have premade node_modules with appropriate version \nready offline, for example.\n\nBut, of course, embedding is also an option, if you treat it as superior \nfor your case."
