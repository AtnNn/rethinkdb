      "OK, but instead of installing n dependencies, if you say \"npm is a dependency\", it will work out of the box, with (imho) cleaner design - the dependencies itself are installed by npm, and project only contains manifest with version numbers. I think this more manageable and changeable. Embedded library is harder to manipulate.\n\nIs requiring npm (that is, node, since it's bundled with it) too much?\n\ncoffeemug wrote:\n> We're already going to specify precise versions in the 1.6 release. \n> The thought process behind adding the libs directly is that many \n> people complained about having to install these dependencies in order \n> to build rethink from scratch, and including them would alleviate that.\n>\n> \8212\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub \n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/958#issuecomment-19214703>.\n>"
