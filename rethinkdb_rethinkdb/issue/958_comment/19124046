      "It seems like this could get to be a hairy situation if developers had their own versions of these tools installed and didn't realize our build process distributed a version of them. It's also a bit of repo bloat which is always a pain. That being said it seems like the pros might well outweigh the cons here I'm just wondering if there's an established way to do this that someone can point to. I know in the rails asset pipeline some people just have a pre-commit hook which compiles the static assets locally and commits them in a specific place. This seems like it would bloat the repo even more but I'm wondering if something like this could work."
