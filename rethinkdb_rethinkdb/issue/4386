        "First, absorb all remaining modules that are html `<script>` imports currently into CommonJS imports (using `require`). Currently this includes:\n- jquery-1.7.2.min.js\n- ZeroClipboard.min.js\n- underscore-min.js\n- backbone.js\n- bootstrap/bootstrap-modal.js\n- bootstrap/bootstrap-alert.js\n- bootstrap/bootstrap-typeahead.js\n- bootstrap/bootstrap-button.js\n- bootstrap/bootstrap-dropdown.js\n- bootstrap/bootstrap-tooltip.js\n- bootstrap/bootstrap-popover.js\n- jquery.form.js\n- nanoscroller/jquery.nanoscroller.min.js\n- jquery.color.js\n- jquery.timeago.js\n- date-en-US.js\n- d3.v2.min.js\n- rdb_cubism.v1.js\n- jquery.dataTables.min.js\n- xdate.js\n- chosen/chosen.jquery.min.js\n- codemirror/codemirror.js\n- codemirror/javascript.js\n- codemirror/matchbrackets.js\n- reql_docs.js\n\nAll third-party dependencies (including `rdb_cubism` and `rethinkdb`) should be put into a second browserify bundle. That way rebuilding the `cluster-min.js` will not require re-browserifying all of the dependencies, only the webui itself, which isn't huge. Additionally, the webui could be built a lot faster if we don't need to use browserify itself, since that spends extra time looking for Node specific apis that we don't use on the frontend (for example require1k is a simple commonjs implementation that might work).\n\nIdeally, we'd also see if all of the current dependencies listed above are needed. There may be some that are unused.\n"
