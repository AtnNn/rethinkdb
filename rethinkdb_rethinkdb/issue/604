        "So I talked about that with @al3xandru few days ago. At that time, he somehow convinced me that it was ok to get back an array and not a cursor.\r\n\r\n\r\nI still don't feel confortable getting an array back sometimes.\r\nIt's a pain because I have to write my callback in different ways and figure out what the good way to do it.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nquery.run( connection, function( err, results) {\r\n    if err\r\n        throw err\r\n    util.log(results);\r\n})\r\n```\r\nvs\r\n```javascript\r\nquery.run( connection, function( err, cursor) {\r\n    if err\r\n        throw err\r\n    cursor.toArray( function(err, results) {\r\n        if err\r\n            throw err\r\n        util.log(results);\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAn argument to have array was for a query like\r\n```javascript\r\nr.expr([1,2,3])\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that means this query is going to return an array too.\r\n```javascript\r\nr.expr([1,2,3]).append( r.table(\"bar\").map(r.row(\"id\") )\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf possible, every time we send back an array or a stream, we should provide an cursor.everytime"
