        "So I talked about that with @al3xandru few days ago. At that time, he somehow convinced me that it was ok to get back an array and not a cursor.\n\nI still don't feel confortable getting an array back sometimes.\nIt's a pain because I have to write my callback in different ways and figure out what the good way to do it.\n\n``` javascript\nquery.run( connection, function( err, results) {\n    if err\n        throw err\n    util.log(results);\n})\n```\n\nvs\n\n``` javascript\nquery.run( connection, function( err, cursor) {\n    if err\n        throw err\n    cursor.toArray( function(err, results) {\n        if err\n            throw err\n        util.log(results);\n    }\n})\n```\n\nAn argument to have array was for a query like\n\n``` javascript\nr.expr([1,2,3])\n```\n\nBut that means this query is going to return an array too.\n\n``` javascript\nr.expr([1,2,3]).append( r.table(\"bar\").map(r.row(\"id\") )\n```\n\nIf possible, every time we send back an array or a stream, we should provide an cursor.everytime\n"
