      "Oh actually the comparison that crashes is probably the line\r\n`guarantee(!is_deleted_);` in `current_page_t::the_page_for_read()`.\r\nIn `cmpb   $0x0,0x10(%rbx)`, `cmpb` compares a byte (which makes sense for bools), the `$0x0` would be the constant false value, and I imagine that 0x10 is the offset of `is_deleted_` in `current_page_t`. `%rbx` is probably supposed to hold the pointer to the `current_page_t`.\r\nThe crash message said `Segmentation fault from reading the address 0x10.`, which would make sense if `%rbx` was 0, i.e. `current_page_` was NULL."
