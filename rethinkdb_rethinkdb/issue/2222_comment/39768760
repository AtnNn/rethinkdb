      "I think we can get into this situation if a deleted page gets snapshotted. Then the `snapshotted_page_` will be empty (because `page_ptr_t::has()` checks whether the pointer to the `page_t` is NULL, which it is in case of a deleted page), and we also will not have a `current_page_`, because we are snapshotted.\r\n\r\nNow generally nobody should attempt to read a deleted page. I will try a bit more to reproduce this problem locally. So far I didn't have any luck."
