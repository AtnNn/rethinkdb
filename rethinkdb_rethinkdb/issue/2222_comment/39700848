      "Thank you! Would it be possible for you to zip up the files and send them to us? (You can send them to slava@rethinkdb.com if they fit into an e-mail; if not we'll set up a share for you).\r\n\r\n> Could not turn off filesystem caching for database file\r\n\r\nAre the RethinkDB data files on an encrypted/compressed file system? In this case Rethink can't use direct IO, so it switches to use the page cache. (I opened an issue in the doc repository to write a troubleshooting entry for it -- https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/259)"
