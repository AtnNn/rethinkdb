      "CoffeeScript 1.5 had an issue that breaks the web ui.\r\nSee https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/380\r\nAnd https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/2715\r\n\r\nIt looks like it's fixed now. So if you update coffee-script it should work (if they pushed it on npm). You can also downgrade coffee-script to 1.4.\r\n```\r\nnpm install coffee-script@1.4\r\n```"
