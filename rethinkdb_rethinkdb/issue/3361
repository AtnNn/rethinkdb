I am executing the queries using the RethinkDB console (version 1.15.1).\r\n\r\nThe following query causes disk access to spike upwards, along with CPU, but the RethinkDB UI shows 0 disk reads and writes:\r\n\r\n  r.db('mydb').table('mytable').distinct({index: 'name'})\r\n\r\nThe final result is an array of 16 unique values and the query profiler shows '0 shard accesses, 293ms server time and 13min 25.92s round trip time.  \r\n\r\n"
