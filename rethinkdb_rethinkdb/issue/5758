        "Hey,\n\nwe are building [Trace](https://trace.risingstack.com/), a Node.js monitoring platform.\n\nFor that, we'd like to instrument rethinkdb as well. We would need to access the Connection class from the `net` module. Is it something you would accept a PR for?\n\nThe change would be only this:\n\n``` javascript\n// net.coffee\n\nmodule.exports.Connection = Connection\n```\n\n``` javascript\n// rethinkdb.coffee\n\nmodule.exports.net = net\n```\n\nThanks,\nGergely\n"
