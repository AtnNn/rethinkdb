      "Just to add my impression of this: I think the odd thing is that some nodes lost connectivity and were not reconnecting (successfully) to certain other nodes, while at the same time happily keeping up connections to the remaining nodes.\r\n@wojons did a ping between two of the nodes that had lost RethinkDB connectivity, and the ping went through fine without any packet loss."
