      "The raw server performance for a single client reading the data, measured without any parsing on the client-side, is approximately 0.8 seconds per 100,000 documents.\r\n\r\nThis is using the documents generated by the script above, just slightly modified to store a more compact unix timestamp rather than a ReQL date/time object in the `now` field.\r\n\r\nIn this test, all data gets transferred to the client, but the client doesn't parse the response (except for a small header).\r\n\r\n@sontek would that be fast enough or do you need higher single-client throughput?\r\nI imagine that we might be able to do some more tuning on the server side for this workload."
