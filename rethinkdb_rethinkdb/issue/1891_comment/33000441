      "JSON.stringify seems to be able to handle the null char.\r\nThe RqlCompileError is thrown by the server, so the null char can make it to the server.\r\n\r\nfor r.json(JSON.stringify(...), the null char may be skipped by the driver. I can think of two places\r\n- when writing the buffer\r\n- when writing on the socket\r\nWe docs specify to use utf8 to keep the null char (else it's converted to a space in ascii). \r\n\r\nWhat's the plan with the null char? Is it to keep it or to properly send an error?"
