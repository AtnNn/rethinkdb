      "... well unless of course we make the server escape '\\' into '\\\\\\\\' as well. However I still don't like the idea. Where would the escaping be reversed? On the server? Then it would send back invalid JSON. If it is not reversed on the server, then it would return a different value than was stored, unless the client driver reverts the escaping."
