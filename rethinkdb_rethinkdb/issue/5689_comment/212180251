      "Thanks @danielmewes \r\n\r\nYeah that makes sense. @barkerja and I talked for a bit on Slack earlier about the issue and basically determined that `join`ing on an index on the left hand side has no real effect since as he mentions above, you can `getAll` on the index and then join based on that data.\r\n\r\nThe issue was for @edwardsmarkf and to see if this was something reql needed or not.\r\n\r\nSounds like not. ;)\r\n\r\nIf we're all satisfied I'd say we can close this."
