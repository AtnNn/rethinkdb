      "Thanks for opening the issue here @NeilHanlon .\r\n\r\nI think using the index on the left table wouldn't make any significant difference for performance. The only difference would be that we could theoretically extract the value of `(row) => [row('key_one'), row('key_two')]` from the index rather than re-evaluating that function for every row from the left table. However that's not always possible the way indexes are stored, and evaluating that function is very cheap anyway.\r\n\r\nOr am I misunderstanding something? Is there another way in which we could utilize the index on the left table in addition to the one on the right table?"
