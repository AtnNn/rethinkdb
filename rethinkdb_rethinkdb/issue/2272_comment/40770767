      "As a test I put RethinkDB (now 1.12.3) and its associated data onto a RAID0 SSD setup (2 drives) with no other activity on it and freshly partitioned and formatted. Established seed data of around 1.9 million documents. No writes: I get an average response of about a 2 seconds on average to return a subset of around 10k documents using between on a secondary index (min was 938ms, and max at 4s even.) Since I'm assuming cache will take over if I run the query again, I restart the server between tests, and have also tried multiple ranges with/without a restart just to see if performance is different. It always averages about the same unless it's a cached result.\r\n\r\nI then start a write process, which is doing data inserts at 80 documents per write (I've also tried 20 and 200.) With the writes going it's a response of an average 14 seconds (min 10s, max 18s.)\r\n\r\nFurther, if I change the range it's still pretty consistent. For instance, if I do a between on just a days worth of data (around 1-2k documents) that's still a server time of around 14 seconds according to the query profiler (again, min 10s, max 18s. )\r\n\r\nOn the regular HDD, the average goes up to several minutes during writes and around 20 seconds without writes. So RAID0 SSD helps. "
