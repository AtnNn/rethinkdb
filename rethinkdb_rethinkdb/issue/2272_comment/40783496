      "@danielmewes - No difference in read performance was noticed. If there is a difference, it's too slight. I could take some time tomorrow and make a matrix of read times along with the associated write activity if you think this would be helpful at all. Along with any other testing if need be. \r\n\r\n@coffeemug - Thanks! I just hope it's enough to help pinpoint what is going on, or why it could be. I'll happily add more details or test anything else that could be deemed relevant. I just want to make sure it's enough information. "
