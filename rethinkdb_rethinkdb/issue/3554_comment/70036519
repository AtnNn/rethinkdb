      "The advantage of `remember_to_consider_destructor_order_t` is that it gives the `auto_drainer_t` a non-trivial constructor, so it must appear in the class's initializer list. The idea is that this would make people think a bit harder. Also, this proposal is mostly for the benefit of new engineers and outside contributors who might not automatically think about destructor order when they see `auto_drainer_t`.\r\n\r\nThe problem with making subscription-like classes take a reference to an `auto_drainer_t` is that it often makes sense to use a subscription-like class without an auto drainer. You only need an `auto_drainer_t` if you're planning to spawn coroutines from your subscription callback."
