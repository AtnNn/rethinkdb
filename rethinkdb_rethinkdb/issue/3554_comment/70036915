      "What if we made the subscription-like class take a pointer to an auto-drainer, or NULL if it doesn't need an auto drainer, and if the subscription-like class receives NULL then it does `ASSERT_NO_CORO_WAITING` before calling its callback to ensure that it actually didn't need the auto drainer?  (Or a boost optional if you don't want people passing NULL pointers out like candy.)"
