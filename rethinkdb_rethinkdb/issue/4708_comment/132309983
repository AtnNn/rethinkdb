      "That's really cool! Unfortunately I'm not running arch Linux, so I can't test it.\r\n\r\nA small thing I noticed: The version of `pb4php` that's included in the source is not actually complete, and it has been patched specifically for php-rql. I actually recommend taking the whole `pb4php` directory out of the package / source path. It is not needed for using the driver, only for generating the `pb4php_pb_proto_ql2.php` file during development."
