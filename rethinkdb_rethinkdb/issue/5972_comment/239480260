      "Sorry @danielmewes, no idea why I didn't get any notification on this issue.\r\n\r\nI don't think it related to the WebUI, the creating/deleting tables were triggered by the code and got timeout, sometimes it caused the ambiguous table name issue (because we handle retry in our code).  CPU always high. The web UI wasn't open at the moment.\r\n\r\nThe query load was almost zero, because we tried to disable all requests to DB to test.\r\n\r\nWe also thought may be it was related to high number of indexes, so we reduced the number as well, but didn't help much.\r\nFinally, after reduce the number of tables to ~100, the cluster works well again."
