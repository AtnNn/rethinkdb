      "The web UI can sometimes generate a significant amount of load if there is a large number of tables, because it polls the system tables periodically.\r\n\r\nDid you have the web UI open when you saw the high CPU load? Can you check if it goes down when closing the web UI?\r\n\r\nWe've also improved the performance of many system tables in a recent version of RethinkDB. It might be worth upgrading to the latest version when you get a chance."
