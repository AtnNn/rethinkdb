      "This issue was originally about API versioning, but the discussion is more about exporting the index function. I think this feature should be in the LTS and not the backlog.\r\n\r\nHow about having `.table(...).info(...)` return for each index an ad-hoc, human readable version of the function and a base64 encoded version of the protobuf.\r\n\r\nThis would allow developers to easily inspect existing indexes, and allow scripts to recreate the index."
