      "Would it be hard to have a method `get_index(\"indexName\")` that would return what was the second argument passed in `indexCreate`?\r\n\r\nI've seen a few users wondering why their index was not working, and were looking to know if they mistype something when creating the index.\r\nThat would also mean `rethinkdb dump` would be able to dump indexes, which would be really useful."
