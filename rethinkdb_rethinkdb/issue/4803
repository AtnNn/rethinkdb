        "I just tried to run the test for reqlite with rethinkdb 2.1.\r\n\r\nThe arity errors are returned without frames (granted that it used to return an empty array) and therefore the driver doesn't print the query anymore. Was that done on purpose? I tested 2.0.4 and backtraces are still there.\r\n\r\nOne more thing `r.expr(null).info()` since 2.0.4 doesn't fill the `value` field. It still does for 2.0.3.\r\nSame question. Was it done on purpose?\r\n\r\nIf it was done on purpose, feel free to close the issue and I'll fix reqlite.\r\nIf it's not I'll just be lazy and wait for an update on your side :-)"
