      "@coffeemug -- is it `get_field` or `get_fields`?  If the latter, what happens if you pass more than one field?  What about on an object instead of a stream?\r\n\r\nI would be cool with doing this.  We should arguably rename `getattr` to `get_field` instead of introducing an alias.  We'd basically be renaming `getattr` and making it polymorphic on streams, which seems more natural to me then changing the shortcut syntax for `map`."
