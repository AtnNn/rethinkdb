      "`get_field` sounds correct to me even with our nomenclature.  I would expect `get_value` to take a value rather than the name of a field.  `has_fields` works the same way; you don't specify a key-value pair to check for, just the name of the field to check for.\r\n\r\nI suppose a more pedantic name would be `get_field_value`, but I think `get_field` is extremely unlikely to confuse anyone.  Other people also seem to be using the name `get_field` to mean \"get the value of a field\": https://www.google.com/search?q=get_field ."
