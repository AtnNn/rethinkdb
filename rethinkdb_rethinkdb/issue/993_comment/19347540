      "This seems a bit similar to a proposal I had a while ago of extending map in a similar way. I.e you oculd say\r\n```\r\nr.expr([{a : 1, b: 1} , {a: 2, b: 2}, {b: 3}]).map('a')\r\n=> [1,2]\r\n```\r\nOne kind of nice thing about this is that we have a lot of places where a string \"foo\" is shorthand for `labmda x: x[\"foo\"]` and this would be another one that fit in well with it. And it also avoids introducing another keyword. It might not be as clear though.\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure I like the `r.expr([{a: 1, b: 1}, {a: 2, b: 2}, {b: 3}])('a')` syntax. I think it's shortened enough that it gets a bit hard to read."
