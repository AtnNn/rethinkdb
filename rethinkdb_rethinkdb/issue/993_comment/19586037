      "Alright, here's what I think we should do:\r\n* Rename `getattr` to `get_field`.\r\n* Make `get_field` polymorphic on arrays with respect to `map`, except that if an object doesn't have the field we just drop it from the stream rather than erroring.  So `tbl.get_field('a')` is `tbl.filter{|x| x.has_fields('a')}.map{|x| x.get_field('a')}`.\r\n* Don't change any of the syntactic sugar in the clients.\r\n"
