      "Suppose we merge `get` and `getAll`.\r\n\r\nWe could have\r\n```\r\nget( \"value\" ) returns a single row selection\r\nget( \"value\", { index: \"name_of_pk\" } ) returns a single row selection\r\nget( \"value\", { index: \"secondary_index\" } ) returns a cursor\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't really see what is the problem here, it looks predictable enough for me.\r\n\r\nI would be cool with a better error message, but merging the two methods make more sense to me."
