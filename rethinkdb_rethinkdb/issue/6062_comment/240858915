      "Thanks for opening an issue.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, the expected performance of both `skip(n).limit(m)` and `slice(n, n+m)` is in `O(n+m)`.\r\n\r\nSmaller limits being slower is very weird. We are probably messing up something with how we do the batching for `.skip.limit`, which indeed is likely related to #6012."
