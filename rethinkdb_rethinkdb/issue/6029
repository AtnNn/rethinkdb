        "Because of the way we define many things in [`ast.py`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/ast.py) as a subclass of `RqlMethodQuery` (i.e.: without overriding the `__init__` method's signature) the arguments to those classes are not defined there, so can not be supplied as keyword arguments, only as positional ones. For some cases this is fine (ones like `floor` that can only take one argument), but for a case like `r.time` this means you can't write the more clear form. For example you have to write:\r\n```\r\nr.time(2016, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 'Z')\r\n```\r\nrather than:\r\n```\r\nr.time(year=2016, month=2, day=2, hour=2, minute=2, second=2, timezone='Z')\r\n```\r\nThe latter example leaves no doubt about what the values are."
