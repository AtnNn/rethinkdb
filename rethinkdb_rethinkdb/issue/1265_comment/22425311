      "ReQL is the name of the query language. The cluster protocol that's used to implement it could in theory be used to implement a different query language as well and we don't refer to that as ReQL, we refer to it as the rdb_protocol. If anything you could argue that the ReQL specific code should be put in its own directory but it's so tightly coupled with the protocol code I really don't think it's worth doing.\r\n\r\nThis issue is pretty inane if you ask me. Renaming directories is a great way to give yourself some really nasty merge conflicts and we're gaining nothing. reql is actually a worse name for a lot of the code in that directory."
