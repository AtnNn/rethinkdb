Used the link provided to download latest ( rethinkdb-2.3.4.zip ) for windows OS but when running it states it's 2.3.3 with the 'newer version is available' message. Seems maybe the 2.3.3 binary made it into the 2.3.4 zip? Or perhaps it's just the version number wasn't updated prior to build/zip.\n"
