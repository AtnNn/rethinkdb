      "This is an old issue, with a lot of conversation. We actually have everything but one done:\r\n\r\n- [x] `help()` does not work - done in 2013 or before\r\n- [x] leaks internal structures on import - done in #2343\r\n- [x] `r.any` and `r.all` were removed at some point\r\n- [ ] Python driver does not support multiple threads - covered in #2427 and #4448\r\n- [x] `Cursor` and `Connection` should inherit from `object`\r\n- [x] `RDBBase`, `RDBOp`, `RDBValue`, `RDBMethod`, `RDBTopFun`, and `RDBBiOper` could be subclasses of `RDBValue` - all replaced at some point\r\n- [x] `Connection` should be publicly available\r\n- [x] `Cursor` should discard old results\r\n- [x] `Connection` should throw RethinkDB specific errors\r\n- [x] `Cursor.__del__` should close the connection with a `Cursor.close()`\r\n- [x] Use `None` (as opposed to `()`) to denote empty keyword arguments\r\n- [x] In expr(): Consider replacing isinstance(val, types.LambdaType) with callable(val) - uses `isinstance(val, collections.Callable)` which is the same thing.\r\n- [x] renaming `build()`, `compose()`, `deconstruct()`, and so on to `_build()`, `_compose()`, `_deconstruct()`, etc. so it's obvious that users shouldn't call them - these are now all hidden within the package\r\n- [x] The class `MakeArray` overrides `do()` with something identical to its parent definition - done in 153a96ab\r\n\r\nSo the only issue left is the threading one, and that is well covered in the referenced issues."
