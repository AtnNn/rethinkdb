      "Just thought of this: what if the reference pseudotype also supported remote resources? It might make sense as a completely different term, but I kinda like the idea of it being the same:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{ authors: ref(r.http('http://api.example.com/authors.json')) }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCombine this with referencing joined fields transparently, and things get insanely awesome!"
