      "I really like this proposal. Couple thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. What is the behavior of `r.table('posts').get(post_id)('author')('id')`? Does this load a document from the `authors` table or reference metadata from the ref field?\r\n1. Likewise, how would I create a secondary index on `author.id` in this example? Would `r.row('author')('id')` work?\r\n1. `follow_refs` should also be able to take a \"selector\" style argument like `.pluck()` and `.withFields()`.\r\n1. Are references checked for existence on insert/update or would it still be possible to create a reference that doesn't actually exist?"
