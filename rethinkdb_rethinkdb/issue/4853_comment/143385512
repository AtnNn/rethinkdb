      "@danielmewes that's even better. If said ReQL expression gets evaluated with the current document set as context for `r.row`, that actually improves the `r.http` use-case. I can now have `authors_url` as it's own field that can be updated/queried against and my reference simply becomes `r.http(r.row('authors_url'))` for all rows. Likewise for traditional joins on ID fields in the original proposal."
