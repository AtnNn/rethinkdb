      "@marshall007 Yeah, I agree that the syntax you mention is a lot better than one that takes multiple fixed arguments.\r\nI like the idea of allowing an arbitrary ReQL query (or function?) to be passed into `r.ref` and then verifying that it falls into one of the categories of let's say `get`, `getAll` and `r.http`.\r\nThis is of course only if we actually decide that restricting the set of allowed functions is worthwhile."
