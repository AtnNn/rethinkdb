        "Querying for overlapping ranges is a common operation. There is currently no good way to optimize it using an index.\n\nHere is a sample query:\n\n```\nr.table('events')\n .filter(lambda event:\n   (event['start'] < end) & (event['end'] > start))\n```\n\nIf we had `r.range` (#875) it might be possible to create a multi-index like this:\n\n```\nhour = 86400\ndef hour_blocks(start, end):\n  n = r.floor((end - start) / hour)\n  offset = r.floor(start / hour)\n  return r.expr(offset).do(lambda offset: r.range(n).map(lambda i: i + offset))\n\nr.table('events')\n .index_create('hours', lambda ev: hour_blocks(ev['start'], ev['end']), multi=True)\n```\n\nAnd query it like this:\n\n```\nr.table('events')\n .getAll(r.args(hour_blocks(start, end)), index='hours')\n .filter(lambda event:\n   (event['start'] < end) & (event['end'] > start))\n```\n\nBut it is still a lot of work. There must be some easier way to work with ranges and time periods. Perhaps something like `getIntersecting` (#2571)\n"
