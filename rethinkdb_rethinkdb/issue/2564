        "If the query language changes, we can't have some cluster nodes running old versions of the software while we run queries that use new query language features.  (We might get away with it, somewhat, if the new query uses a table whose replicas are all on nodes running the newer version.  Upgrading per-table would be more complicated and useless, though.)\n\nWe'll need a way to tell everything in the cluster that every node in the cluster now supports the latest version of the query language, and that they may now evaluate queries using the new query language features.  (And then, older versions of RethinkDB should not be allowed to connect.)\n\nWhat we should not do:  You might think we could just error if a query tries to use a feature not supported by the current process's version of RethinkDB.  This would obviously be a bad idea.\n\nI have put this in 1.14, under the assumption that there will be some relevant query language change in 1.14.\n\nThis cluster-wide notification of behavioral differences might eventually extend to activating other features.\n"
