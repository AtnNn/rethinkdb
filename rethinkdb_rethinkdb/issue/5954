        "We have a 3 machine cluster running on docker cloud (AWS host). We spin a container to make backups every hour of our database. Everything is working fine.\r\n\r\nExcept that we have a small database and during the bkp time the reads go up 15k and makes major of system queries to run slowly.\r\n\r\nThe bkp log:\r\n```\r\n1476078 rows exported from 25 tables, with 70 secondary indexes\r\nDone (213 seconds)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe data of exporting some key tables\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"new_val\": {\r\n    \"duration_sec\": 193.228456,\r\n    \"id\": [\r\n      \"query\",\r\n      \"17b3296e-e380-412a-b970-4e23416de7d4\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"info\": {\r\n      \"client_address\": \"::ffff:10.7.0.47\",\r\n      \"client_port\": 53419,\r\n      \"query\": \"r.db().table().orderBy({\\\"index\\\": \\\"id\\\"})\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"servers\": [\r\n      \"rethinkdb_1\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"type\": \"query\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"old_val\": {\r\n    \"duration_sec\": 192.226475,\r\n    \"id\": [\r\n      \"query\",\r\n      \"17b3296e-e380-412a-b970-4e23416de7d4\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"info\": {\r\n      \"client_address\": \"::ffff:10.7.0.47\",\r\n      \"client_port\": 53419,\r\n      \"query\": \"r.db().table().orderBy({\\\"index\\\": \\\"id\\\"})\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"servers\": [\r\n      \"rethinkdb_1\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"type\": \"query\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is since I have a single database in my cluster and I want always bkp the full database, would be better bkp the filesystem in this case ?! Is this possible ?! How can I recover the database in that scenario ?!"
