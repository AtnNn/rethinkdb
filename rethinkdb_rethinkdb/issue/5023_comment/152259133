      "Thanks for reporting this @kwando .\r\n\r\nRethinkDB is mostly optimized for documents of up to a couple 100 KB in size. That being said there's no technical reason as far as I can tell that would stop us from improving performance for larger documents like yours. Especially the slowdown when going to two shards (even though it's on the same machine) is unexpected.\r\n\r\nWe'll investigate this and see what we can do to optimize performance in the server."
