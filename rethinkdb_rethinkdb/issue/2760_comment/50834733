      "It turns out that the first problem is #2649 as well, but in a subtle way. The reason that it is not returning an error is because it winds up re-using the data directory from a previous run, and the next test adds exactly that authkey to the server.\r\n\r\nThe solution is two-fold:\r\n1. Fix it so that we are not re-using the same data directory over and over (see my proposal for #2649)\r\n2. Change the auth-key that we add to the server on the \"correct authorization key\" test so that it not the same one as \"authorization key when none needed\""
