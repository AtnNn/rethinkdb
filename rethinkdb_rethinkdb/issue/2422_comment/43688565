      "I don't know where the problem is coming from, but we should definitely return a better error message (e.g. `Incompatible driver and server versions.`) and make sure it shows up in all drivers. I think the magic number alone isn't sufficient since the server couldn't tell if it's a bad driver version or a random piece of software connecting to its port, so we'd need a constant magic number, and a floating version number or some such."
