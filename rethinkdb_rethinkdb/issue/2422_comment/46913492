      "@Tryneus -- wait, I don't understand. The server should be sending a \"bad magic number\" message, but isn't. Why? Once we figure that out, we could also just improve the error message (e.g. \"Bad magic number. Are you sure you're on the right driver version?\") and call it a day. Would that work?"
