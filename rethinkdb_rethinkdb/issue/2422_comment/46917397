      "Yep, that's it.  The EPIPE is on a write call, so the driver writes the invalid version number, but still has more to write to the server.  The server closes the connection before the driver writes the rest of its side of the handshake, so EPIPE gets thrown when the driver attempts the rest of the handshake.  I'll see if we can just write the handshake in one write call to avoid this situation."
