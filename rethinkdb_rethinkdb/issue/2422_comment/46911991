      "@coffeemug, unfortunately, we can't change the handshake without moving to another, newer version number (and likely causing people to run into this problem again).  What if we just pre-allocated the next few version numbers in the .proto file, so we can tell people they're using a newer driver than the one supported by the server?\r\n\r\nI'll look into reproducing the EPIPE error."
