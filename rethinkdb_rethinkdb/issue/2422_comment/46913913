      "My suspicious is that the server is sending the error message, then closing the TCP connection, but the client errors on the closed connection before reporting the error (trying to reproduce this now).\r\n\r\nAs for the error message itself, that would be fine, but I was hoping to give a more confident error message when they are using an incorrect version."
