      "Alright, sounds reasonable.\r\n\r\n`ambiguous_table_exc_t` could be handled either way. We could keep it the way it is for consistency with `no_such_table_exc_t`, or we could replace it with `exc_t` because in practice we never actually catch it or process it in any special way.\r\n\r\nIt might make sense to call the new type `user_exc_t`."
