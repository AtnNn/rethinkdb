        "Protobuf decoding seems to be pretty slow in the clients too.  I think this will improve our read performance pretty considerably for large rows.\r\n\r\nTo avoid breaking old clients, we might want to consider accepting a global optarg (similar to how we implement noreply writes) saying whether or not we can return the result as JSON.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug -- I think is one is important, could we try to schedule it in 1.8?"
