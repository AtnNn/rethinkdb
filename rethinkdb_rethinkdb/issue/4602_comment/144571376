      "It has been decided that we are going to do this and only use the embedded version if `icu`. Additionally rather than importing all of the version of `icu` that `v8` uses (~5300 files), and we deleted before importing all of `v8`, we are going to remove `v8` from our git repository[1] and let the download system take over that. There was some commentary about this in #1231 and #1743, but we think it is the lesser evil.\r\n\r\nThe other note to make on this is that we will no longer explicitly list and of the `icu` libraries in our makefiles. Rather they will be implicitly brought in by the `v8` module. This is imperfect, but all of the other options that we thought of had nasty flaws in them, or felt hask-ish.\r\n\r\n[1] The files will still be in our git history, but not at HEAD"
