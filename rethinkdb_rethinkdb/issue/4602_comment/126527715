      "There have been a few comments in the Apple developer forums about people having similar problems on El Capitan dev/beta builds and coming to this conclusion. And Apple is focusing on \"runtime\" security protections so it is a good guess about what is going on. But the main evidence is that this is failing with the only change being me moving to El Capitan public beta. We won't get anything official out of Apple until it comes out, far too late in my opinion.\r\n\r\nSo unless you believe that either we should not support building on El Capitan, or that it will start working again with no involvement from us, we are going to have to work around this."
