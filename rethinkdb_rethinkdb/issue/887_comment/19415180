      "If you're thinking about compressing the JSON, you should maybe consider some higher-speed compression algorithms like Snappy or LZ4 (the latter of which claims to be able to approach memory speeds)... compression ratios aren't quite as good, but you get the extra compactness basically for free, unlike with gzip."
