      "I'm now convinced of the merits of this. Even after we add additional data types to RethinkDB many users will still be working with plain old JSON as a lingua franca amongst different pieces of their application. Though it won't be universal, the shortcut will continue to be very valuable to users who want to feed existing JSON documents directly into RethinkDB."
