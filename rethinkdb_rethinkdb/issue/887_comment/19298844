      "Are we planning to automatically send inserted data as json from the drivers rather than converting it to protocol buffers? It seems like in the drivers where we know that the protocol buffer serialization is a lot slower than json serialization (which AFAIK is all of them) we should do this automatically since it will be a huge performance boost that will help with first impressions. No reason to make people think about something extra for performance reasons when they don't have to."
