      "How difficult would it be to enable changefeeds on all system tables? There are a few very compelling reasons to do it for every table in reql-admin-v1 outside of immediate utility:\r\n\r\n- Consistency lends elegance.\r\n- Changefeeds will be crucial for communicating the value of RethinkDB to people. Illustrating that people can observe the cluster itself via changefeeds gives this story significantly more punch.\r\n- We'll likely be using the web ui as an example app in the app showcase. It would be very nice if it could use feeds to at least some degree and lend the story more credibility."
