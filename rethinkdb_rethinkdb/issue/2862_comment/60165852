      "@coffeemug, we should decide which pseudo-tables should support changefeeds, especially for the first release.  I think this would be very useful for the `issues` table, and should be scheduled for 1.16 for that reason alone, and we can have other pseudo-tables reject changefeed requests out-of-hand."
