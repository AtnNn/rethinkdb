      "I'm a little unclear what you mean when you say that e.g. we'll report that the entire issues table has changed.  If most of the issues are still the same, we won't report anything for those issues, right?  I think that's pretty important.\r\n\r\nWe talked about the logs table already; I think it's OK if a server goes away to throw an error on the `logs` changefeed the same way we do when a master goes away on a normal table.\r\n\r\nOther than that I don't have much feedback.  It sounds pretty reasonable.  (It would be nice if we could avoid keeping everything in memory on the machine serving the changefeed, though.  I'm a little unclear on why we have to do that.)"
