      "[#2692](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2692) would work for most problems I mentioned initially, except the merge case and maybe other document manipulation commands. If those cases are not important then something like r.path is not necessary.\r\nThe first thing that comes to my mind is doing complex queries using merge inside a map operation. I think that is the only kind of cases left out by the update-only solution.\r\n\r\n    r.table('users').getAll(1, 2, 3).map(function(user) {\r\n        return user.merge({\r\n            field1: {\r\n                field2: {\r\n                    field3: {\r\n                        field4: \"hello\"\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n"
