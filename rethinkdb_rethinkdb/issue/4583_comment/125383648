      "#2692 would definitely only work for the `update`, `replace` and possibly `delete` commands. Not with `merge`. It wouldn't change the meaning of any queries that already work at the moment. It would only allow some queries that currently error to work.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?\r\n\r\nI think `r.path` has some additional use cases, but I'm not sure if it's really necessary if we implement #2692.
