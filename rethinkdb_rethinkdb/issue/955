        "Suppose I have a compound index `cid` and I want to get all of documents that have `\"foo\"` as the first value in the compound index. AFAIK there isn't a great way to do this in ReQL. The best way to do this that I can come up with is:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nr.table.between([\"foo\"], [\"fop\"], id = \"cid\").filter(lambda x: x[\"cid\"][0] == \"foo\")\r\n```\r\nWhich isn't terribly pretty. I'm not sure I have a full proposal for this (hence the non proposal title). I'd like the support the syntax:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nr.table.prefix([\"foo\"], id = \"cid\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich would be feasible. What do others think would be a good API for this?"
