        "With user authentication and TLS encryption going to become available in RethinkDB 2.3, it can often be useful to expose the ReQL client/driver port to a different set of interfaces than the cluster port and/or the web UI port.\r\n\r\nI propose:\r\n* `--bind-http`\r\n* `--bind-cluster`\r\n* `--bind-driver`\r\n* Keep `--bind` for simplicity, but disallow its use as soon as any of the other arguments is used (to avoid confusion and potentially dangerous misconfiguration)\r\n* Keep the single `--no-default-bind` and have it apply to all of the above parameters equally.\r\n\r\nPinging @Tryneus @VeXocide for comments"
