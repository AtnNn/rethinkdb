        "With user authentication and TLS encryption going to become available in RethinkDB 2.3, it can often be useful to expose the ReQL client/driver port to a different set of interfaces than the cluster port and/or the web UI port.\n\nI propose:\n- `--bind-http`\n- `--bind-cluster`\n- `--bind-driver`\n- Keep `--bind` for simplicity, but disallow its use as soon as any of the other arguments is used (to avoid confusion and potentially dangerous misconfiguration)\n- Keep the single `--no-default-bind` and have it apply to all of the above parameters equally.\n\nPinging @Tryneus @VeXocide for comments\n"
