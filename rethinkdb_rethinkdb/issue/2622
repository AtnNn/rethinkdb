        "Change feed on 1.13 is very intersting feature.Multi-media-realtime HTML5 projects are getitng very popular these days , and i am building one right now too , a multi-media-webchat .It needs a lot of serverside notifications.\nHowever , RethinkDB still needs async driver for Tornadoweb, like Motor driver by MongoDB does , that is only deal-blocking  feature that blocking me changing from Mongo.\nI Love ReQL and I really believe that RethinkDB is NoSQL-Done-Right. \n\nAny Pointers on modifying current driver work async would be very good,I would like to contribute. (I am still quite new on Async and Tornado.\n"
