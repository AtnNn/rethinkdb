      "@Plasma -- thanks for submitting this!\r\n\r\nThe fact that sharding key is currently required to be the same as the primary key is somewhat of an engineering accident. I don't believe there is a fundamental architectural reason for this requirement.\r\n\r\nWe'll try to get this done along with #364. It isn't on the immediate list of priorities, but is very likely to get done in the next three months."
