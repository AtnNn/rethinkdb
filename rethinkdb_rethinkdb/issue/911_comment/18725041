      "Ok, I talked to @jdoliner and it looks like doing this is pretty difficult. Specifically, we'd have to rework ReQL and the underlying clustering layer to do everything based on shard keys instead of primary keys. This is doable, but is a non-trivial amount of work, so unfortunately I don't expect we'd be able to get this done in the short term.\r\n\r\nThere may be other solutions to this problem (such as appending a UUID to the primary key). We'll see if we can support these in the meantime, but again, there are some lower-hanging fruit for us to pick, so this might take a bit.\r\n\r\nSorry to disappoint :( I'd like to solve this eventually, but so far it looks like the ETA on this would be in a six month ballpark instead of a few weeks."
