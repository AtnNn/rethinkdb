        "Here are the changes I'd like to see in the connection/cursor/reql testing setups:\n1. ~~They should integrate with `Makefile` in `test/` directory. When I run `make js`, it should run reql tests, cursor tests, and connection tests, ditto for `make py`. (This probably means `test_cursor` should take a flag whether to run python or js tests that the makefile will pass to it).~~\n2. ~~There should be a single path in the `Makefile` to the rethinkdb server that all tests use. This way the person running the tests can override it at any time.~~\n3. ~~Cursor/connection tests should use the function to find available port, otherwise things don't work on newton.~~\n4. ~~Default host/port tests should be optional and turned off by default. I should be able to turn them on via the makefile. (e.g. `make py TEST_DEFAULT_PORT=1`)~~\n5. Test `use` and `run_outdated` in py and js tests\n6. ~~Turn off js server testing for now~~\n7. Test what happens if the user passed too many (or too few) arguments to connection level functions (e.g. `connect`, `use`, `next`, etc.) in the JS driver.\n8. ~~Add `.repl()` method to the connection object as described in #256. (Definitely in Python, not sure about JS -- up to you @wmrowan).~~\n   8.1 Test Python's `.repl`\n9. ~~Make sure the user can pass a default db to `connect`~~\n   9.1. Test setting the default db through `connect` not just `use`\n10. Test for the the reservation of at least one row for the last batch in a chunked stream.\n"
