      "@mlucy -- with the fact that the formats are different in the different drivers.\r\n\r\nUsers often try stuff in the data explorer, then translate their queries in python/ruby/go/etc. And basically with `group`, they won't be able to.\r\nIt's a little worse since this is useful when you build complicated queries, like with `group` for example.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should have by default the same values in all three drivers. We can then have flags/options to change the format if the user want."
