      "@neumino -- I can't speak for all users, but it is SUPER confusing in the data explorer.  Saying \"the behavior is well-defined and can be explained\" doesn't really matter when the first-touch experience of using it is confusing and complicated.  Having two types which don't behave the same way but which are displayed exactly the same way in the data explorer is too confusing to ship with, even if we can explain to users why it is that way."
