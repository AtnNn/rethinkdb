      "I think the biggest benefit of adding a wrapper class is that we can allow random access of the results, which might be a pain for users to do themselves.  Avoiding confusing users is nice, but we should focus on what makes a simple and usable interface.  At this point, I'm not convinced the wrapper classes are a good idea, if we just return `[{group:<group>,reduction:<reduction>}...]`, and let users handle it from there, I think that is enough."
