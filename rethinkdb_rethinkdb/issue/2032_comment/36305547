      "@neumino -- the problem is that people call `tbl.group('a').count()`, and they get back `[{group: ..., reduction: ...}, ...]`, and they're like \"OK, I've got an array, I'll order that array by the reduction...\" -- then they run `tbl.group('a').count().orderBy('reduction')`, and it doesn't do what they expect.\r\n\r\nThen maybe they go read the docs, they find out about this \"ungroup\", and they're like OK, and they run `tbl.group('a').count().ungroup()`, and they get back...the exact same thing they got before (`[{group: ..., reduction: ...}, ...]`).  And they're like \"what the fuck does ungroup do?\".  The idea that the type you get on the client corresponds the the type you get on the server if you call `ungroup` is really hard to explain.\r\n\r\n"
