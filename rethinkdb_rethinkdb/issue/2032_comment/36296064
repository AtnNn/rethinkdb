      "Ok, I'm leaning towards defining an object for the Javascript and Python drivers that supports iteration and getting a given group from the results.  I believe this will satisfy a vast majority of the use cases, and allows us to make a wrap around the limitations of dicts/Objects in py and js (specifically that we cannot have dicts/Objects as keys).\r\n\r\nI'm working on a Javascript implementation now of a GroupedData object that implements `hasNext`, `next`, `each`, `toArray`, and `get`, so people can play around with it and see how it feels.  The python version should be much easier to do."
