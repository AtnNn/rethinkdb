      "I very strongly disagree with @atnnn's proposal. Forcing people to call `ungroup` to get the data back is extremely annoying. I think doing that would cut the pleasantness of this feature in half.\r\n\r\nI'm also very strongly opposed to representing GROUP_DATA in JS via the same object that the user would get by calling `ungroup`. That's *extremely* confusing.\r\n\r\nInstead of building a custom wrapper, why don't we just construct a native JavaScript object (like we do in Ruby)?"
