      "Err, actually I'm opposed to the last part (constructing a native JS object), all the automagical conversion to strings is just terrible.\r\n\r\nSo it's between a custom object or an array of pairs (an array of arrays, basically). I think an array of pairs is easiest: `[['nyc', 2], ['sf', 1]]`. If people want a proper `{group: ..., reduction: ...}` they can call `ungroup`.\r\n\r\nHow about that?"
