      "We can just improve the error message, in case an error (maybe just some of them) is thrown in a `group_data`/`group_streams`, we can suggest that maybe they want to `ungroup` before.\r\n\r\nI still think that adding a new type is not the solution here and is just going to end up as a burden for our users.\r\n\r\nNote: The data explorer already presents cursor and arrays the same way.\r\n"
