      "> an array of pairs solves half the confusion (\"the output is the same whether or not I call `ungroup`\", but not \"I'm getting back an array but I can't chain functions on the end like I expect\"\r\n\r\nI see. I think the latter is a smaller problem, though. Also, this will be a problem with the way we present the results in the data explorer.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need me to rally people together in a room and such (we do need to arrive at a good solution, as this is stretching).\r\n"
