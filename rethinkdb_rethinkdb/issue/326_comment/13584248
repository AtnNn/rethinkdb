      "I like the idea of aggregation functions taking an optional (or perhaps even a required) argument for the name of the result. As for `alias`, see #328.\r\n\r\nOn a different note, there are some ideas floating around for `rename/alias`, `pluck`, `values`, and I have some ideas in my head about ML-style pattern matching, Common Lisp-style destructuring, XPath, and css selectors. I think all of these are circling around a really clean, useful, and beautiful abstraction of manipulating, querying, and transforming hierarchical documents, but it hasn't yet crystallized in my head yet. (I can't even express the *problem* clearly, though I feel like it's getting closer to the surface of my conscious mind). I'm hoping that by spawning discussions around all of the related issues we can arrive at this together and hopefully come up with something beautiful."
