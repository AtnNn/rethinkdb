      "To clarify, here's an example of what the user should be able to do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nissues.groupBy(r.row('milestone')('title'), [r.sum(r('foo')('bar')), r.sum('baz')])\r\n```\r\n\r\n(not sure where we should put square breaks -- for mappings or for reductions).\r\n\r\nEDIT: should we drop the string syntax sugar for referring to attributes whenever possible?\r\nEDIT2: being able to pass arbitrary expressions here is also very nice because people can (and in SQL often do) do something like this: `r.sum(r.branch(r.row[state].eq('open'), 1, 0))`"
