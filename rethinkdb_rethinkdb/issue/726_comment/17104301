      "Regardless of whether we want a list of types or a list of signatures (that is a rather complex question), we want to use a list instead of a pipe because a list is a structured, programmatically accessible representation of the underlying format. A pipe on the other hand isn't -- it's just a string (it can of course be programmatically parsed, but that's a hack that defeats the point of using markup).\r\n\r\nSince the yaml doc file is also used by the data explorer that needs to access this information programmatically, we should make the effort to use yaml's facilities for representing lists, instead of inventing our own."
