      "I don't want to try reproducing this (setting up a new VM is annoying).  If I remember correctly I simply removed the \"/local\" from what they were set to before, and /usr/bin/{coffee,lessc,handlebars} did exist.  This is because they were installed by the node.js ppa instead of installing node.js from source."
