      "I was unable to reproduce. Please reopen if it happens again, and include the full `config.mk` file.\r\n\r\nFor less, the configure script checks for `$LESS` or `which less`. If neither are found and `--allow-fetch` is set, it tells make to build it in `./support/usr/bin/less`. Same for handlebars and coffee."
