      "Assuming that the table does not already exist, and that you have not specified `--shards` or `--replicas` on the command line, we already only create a single shard. While that does have the potential for nasty surprises if someone is restoring to a computer that does not have enough space for the whole table, that is probably the best we are going to be able to do at this point. So we allow people to do the right thing, but still keep our logic simple.\r\n\r\nOn when to build indexes... After talking it over internally, we think that it is probably best to do post-construction by default and will be changing this. At one point in out codebase it was probably faster to do pre-construction, but with the exception of really large tables on spinning disks we expect post-construction to be generally faster and will switch that over.\r\n\r\nSo I am going to change that last bit in the near future, but I think that will be the only change we will take from this."
