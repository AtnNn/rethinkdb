        "I was taking a brief look at YCSB and noticed that for point gets, we are doing a pluck. This is perfectly sane. Efficiently implemented, pluck should be a practically zero-cost operator.\n\nBut it isn't. Here's a quick experiment:\n\nFirst the output:\n\n```\nGet: 875.38309583279qps\nGetAll: 841.41265312264qps\nGet pluck: 542.69162263385qps\nGetAll pluck: 733.0771512848qps\n```\n\nThe code:\n\n```\nr\\db('test')->tableCreate('t55')->run($conn);\n$doc = array('id' => \"1\", 'foo' => 'test');\n    r\\table('t55')->insert($doc)->run($conn);\n\n// Experiment 1:\n$t = microtime(true);\nfor ($i = 0; $i < 10000; ++$i)\n    r\\table('t55')->get(1)->run($conn);\necho \"Get: \" . 10000 / (microtime(true) - $t) . \"qps\\n\";\n\n// Experiment 2:\n$t = microtime(true);\nfor ($i = 0; $i < 10000; ++$i)\n    r\\table('t55')->getAll(1)->run($conn);\necho \"GetAll: \" . 10000 / (microtime(true) - $t) . \"qps\\n\";\n\n// Experiment 3:\n$t = microtime(true);\nfor ($i = 0; $i < 10000; ++$i)\n    r\\table('t55')->get(1)->pluck(array('id', 'foo'))->run($conn);\necho \"Get pluck: \" . 10000 / (microtime(true) - $t) . \"qps\\n\";\n\n// Experiment 4:\n$t = microtime(true);\nfor ($i = 0; $i < 10000; ++$i)\n    r\\table('t55')->getAll(1)->pluck(array('id', 'foo'))->run($conn);\necho \"GetAll pluck: \" . 10000 / (microtime(true) - $t) . \"qps\\n\";\n```\n\nRethinkDB CPU utilization while running the different parts:\nGet: 60 %\nGetAll: 60 %\nGet + Pluck: 69 %\nGetAll + Pluck: 55 %\n\nConclusion: Pluck makes gets slower by about 40 %. While I am using only a single client/connection, this cannot be attributed to a longer delay alone, as the CPU usage is actually higher with pluck, while processing fewer queries per second. Weirdly, pluck on sequences seems to be significantly faster than pluck on a single object.\nWe should find out what makes pluck so slow, and check if the same issue affects other operations as well.\n"
