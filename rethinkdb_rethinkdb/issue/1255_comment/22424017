      "Implemented in `michel_1255_dates_2`.\r\nDates are displayed as a black field (to make it different than a normal strings -- which are green).\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- The dates are displayed with the user local timezone.\r\n- The dates are converted only before displaying them. I'm not making a deep copy of all the results (that's done in `michel_1255_dates` (and works, but I would rather not use this method).\r\nSo in the table view, Date.epoch_time can still be displayed in some cases (like if the user replace a date with a normal object with a field named `epoch_time` -- but it's fair to assume that people probably won't get in such situation...).\r\n\r\nReview 807 assigned to @mglukhovsky "
