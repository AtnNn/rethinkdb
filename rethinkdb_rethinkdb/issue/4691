        "In working on a test I found that there appears to be a race condition between a `table.config().update()` and a `table.wait()` immediacy following it on the same connection. This is happening regardless of what `wait_for` mode I am using, but a 1 second `time.sleep()` does fix it. @VeXocide thought that the `all_replicas_ready` option should fix this, but it does not in my case.\r\n\r\nThis bug is to make sure we understand this behavior and that it is not unexpected."
