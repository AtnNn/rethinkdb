      "Ignoring the question of whether your system is going into swap or not (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4137), a reduction in write performance of 10x is actually quite reasonable for 10 indexes.\r\n\r\nWriting 10 indexes is roughly 10 times the work of writing a single one.\r\n\r\nAre you specifying soft durability for the writes or using the default of hard durability?"
