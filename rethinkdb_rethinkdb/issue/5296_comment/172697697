      "Assuming this is JavaScript, that's just because we cannot overload the `+` operator. So you have to use `.add` in combination with `r.expr`. Unfortunately there's nothing we can do about this as far as I know.\r\nIn the Python and Ruby driver we overload the `+` operator. You still need to use `r.expr` there to turn the string into a ReQL string, but you can avoid the `add`."
