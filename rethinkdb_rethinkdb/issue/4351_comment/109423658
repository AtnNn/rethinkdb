      "thanks for the detail. the subtlety I'm questioning is, is a one-element compound index the same as a simple index? I made a little index builder helper where the index fields are specified to a function as an array. For a non-geo index a one element array appears to be equivalent to the simple index, which is why the geo exception was surprising.\r\n"
