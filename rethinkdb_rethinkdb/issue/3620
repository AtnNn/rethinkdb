        "I noticed a few bugs in the history feature of the data explorer -- the code probably could use a critical lookover. Here are two issues I noticed:\r\n\r\n1. Click on the history button to open the history window\r\n2. Press \"clear history\"\r\n3. Click on the history button to close the history window\r\n4. Run a query (I ran `r.db('rethinkdb').table('stats').changes()`)\r\n\r\nThe history window will open itself, but it should stay closed. For some reason the web ui loses/caches the state while it shouldn't.\r\n\r\nAnother bug I found is that the data explorer shows stale history while in this state:\r\n\r\n1. Click on the history button to open the history window\r\n2. Press \"clear history\"\r\n3. Click on the history button to close the history window\r\n4. Run a query (I ran `r.db('rethinkdb').table('stats').changes()`). The history window will open (as described above)\r\n5. Run another query (say,  `r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').changes()`). At this point the second query won't show up in history while it should\r\n6. Click on the history button. The new query will show up as it should\r\n\r\n/cc @AtnNn \r\n"
