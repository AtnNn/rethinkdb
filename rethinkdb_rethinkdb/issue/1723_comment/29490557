      "I should note that I didn't add the example config for `canonical-address` to the default file, as I thought I'd let you guys craft the help message.. Something like:\r\n\r\n    ## Bind the cluster interface to a canonical address\r\n    ## Use when you want to connect rethinkdb servers over a WAN, as by default rethinkdb binds to local interfaces\r\n    ## Default: none\r\n    # canonical-address=example.com"
