      "I'm not sure where the problem is exactly, but we break the recursion by using setImmediate here:\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/cursor.coffee#L78\r\n\r\nFirefox doesn't setImmediate so we replace it with `setTimeout(..., 0)`. Maybe that isn't enough to break the recursion? Or there's a path that avoid setImmediate?"
