        "I've seen that you have added compound indices and that there's a feature request for multi indices, too, at https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/933.\r\n\r\nWhat about combining those 2 and making dynamic indices?\r\n\r\nThis could be achieved by allowing the user to pass a function to the \"indexCreate\" function, that then returns an array of values to index the document to.\r\n\r\n### An example for a compund index:\r\n\r\n#### data\r\n     {street:\"samplestreet 6\",zip:0000,city:\"mycity\"}\r\n#### index\r\n    r.indexCreate(\"addresslowercase\",function(row){\r\n       return [(row.street+\", \"+row.zip+\" \"+row.city).toLowerCase()];\r\n    });\r\n#### query\r\n    r.table(\"addresses\").get(\"samplestreet 6, 0000 mycity\",{index:\"addresslowercase\"})\r\n\r\n\r\n### An example for a multiindex:\r\n\r\n#### data\r\n    {father:\"xyz\",mother:\"zyx\"}\r\n#### index\r\n    r.indexCreate(\"parent\",function(row){\r\n        return [row.father,row.mother];\r\n    });\r\n#### query\r\n    r.table(\"persons\").get(\"xyz\",{index:\"parent\"});\r\n\r\nThis would give the user the maximum flexibility. Wouldn't it be awesome?"
