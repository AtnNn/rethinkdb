      "I think thatchanging the default cache size is not the answer here. \r\n\r\nBasically what we're worried about is how this is going to work for people out of the box. Anyone who is seriously administering this software is going to make sure not to run afoul of the oom. We've had a few cases of people running afoul of it in really low memory settings and to accommodate those and not crash we'd need to run with a cache that's somewhere around 50MB which is really going to slow things down. There's definitely a cost to being slow out of the box by default if someone is sitting there watching a query that takes less than a second in mongo take 50 in RethinkDB that is going to matter. Bad first impressions easily become last impressions. \r\n\r\nGrepping through the logs is doable but obviously very very unportable but we can probably do that.\r\n\r\nOverall this sucks but when an operating just sends you a sigkill with no warning they put you in a tough spot and I don't think we have a great option here."
