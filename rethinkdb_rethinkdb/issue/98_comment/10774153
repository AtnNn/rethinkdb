      "@jdoliner unfortunately I don't know the very deep details of our implementation to come up with a number, but I think one exercise that could lead us to a possible good number is:\r\n\r\n1. what are the components of the system that require fixed amounts of memory?\r\n2. what are the components that boost the speed of the system when having more memory?\r\n3. which of these components share memory and which ones require their own memory? \r\n4. which of these components are created as per an user action? (database, table, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis will not give us the \"perfect\" number, but could give us an estimated default. The next possibility is that we could allow an user to configure this differently."
