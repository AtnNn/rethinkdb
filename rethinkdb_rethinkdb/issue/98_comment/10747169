      "The problem here isn't being slow on systems with low-memory conditions. The problem is being slow on systems with plenty of memory because we picked a poor default to avoid getting killed on low-memory systems. We need to do a bit of engineering work to make this happen (by making the caching system be able to steal cache memory from other tables properly).\r\n\r\nSo it's really a question of picking a good interim default until we get the dynamic caching system done (the system can always be configured to work properly, it's just a matter of a default option)."
