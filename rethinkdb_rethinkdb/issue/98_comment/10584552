      "Yeah, I agree that the cost to making this work out of the box on low-memory systems may be too high. I don't think the assertion that \"anyone who is seriously administering software will understand this\" applies though -- most people are downloading rethink to try it on their dev systems, so they don't necessarily have the operations experience to understand (or even know about) the OOM killer.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to make the default cache size on table creation be a well defined function on amount of available memory. I'm not sure if I like this, but it's an option.\r\n\r\nAnd of course the last option is to bite the bullet and wait on #97."
