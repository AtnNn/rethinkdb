        "As brought up in #2430, the test_utils.py methods used in the rql_tests does not do nearly as good a job of waiting for the server to be up as the methods used in common/driver.py. There are a number of other features that are also missing in test_utils (e.g.: the ability to multi-thread tests). To solve all of these problems, the two systems should be merged together."
