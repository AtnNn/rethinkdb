      "After discussing the \"no `static_cast<bool>` for optionals\" we decided to go with an explicit comparison to `boost::none` instead of the implicit conversion.\r\n\r\nThis fits the current style guide rule to explicitly compare pointers to `nullptr`, it does not use a `static_cast`, and it catches a few more edge cases.\r\n\r\nOne of these edge cases is changing an `boost::optional<int> i` to an `int i`. `if (i) { ... }` would still compile and behave differently whereas `if (i == boost::none) { ... }` would fail to compile.\r\n\r\nI'll change the proposal above to reflect this."
