        "We have had a couple of serious issues in combination with Btrfs, most likely due to bugs in the file system. E.g. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3285 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2781\r\n\r\nAs discussed here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3285#issuecomment-61865488 we should print a warning to the log if we detect that the data is on a Btrfs file system, state that support for Btrfs is experimental, and recommend that users use the `--no-direct-io` flag to reduce the chance of issues."
