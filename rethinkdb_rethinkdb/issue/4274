        "We have a use-case where our data team needs to restore multiple backups from arbitrary points in time for historical analysis. It would be great if we could specify the database names as parameters to `rethinkdb restore`. I was already working on implementing this, but I wanted to get some feedback on the arguments before continuing. Here's what I'm thinking:\r\n\r\n- `--prefix`: prefix all restored database names\r\n- `--suffix`: suffix all restored database names\r\n- `--import <old>:<new>`: explicitly rename database named `<old>` in the backup to `<new>`"
