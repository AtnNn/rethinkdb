      "Just tested it with the SamCache from branch sam_alt and it just works beautifully. No (noticeable) stalls there anymore. :-)\r\n\r\nI can reliably reproduce it with the old cache though. Just insert something like 5M documents into a table, continuously run inserts, and then fire a `table().count()` at it.\r\n\r\nKeeping it open until the new cache has been merged."
