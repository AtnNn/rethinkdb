      "To summarize (from the user's POV):\r\n\r\n- Client sends write to RethinkDB; RethinkDB checks if there are enough nodes connected who could ack the write (without pinging nodes, it uses the last available connectivity information). If there aren't, the server returns an error \"Write failed, insufficient replicas to satisfy acknowledgement requirements.\"\r\n- If there are enough replicas in the connectivity metadata, RethinkDB sends the write to the nodes. When enough acks come back, RethinkDB sends back an ack to the client (as it does now).\r\n- If not enough acks come back, RethinkDB sends back an error \"Write partially completed, insufficient replicas to satisfy write acknowledgement requirements.\""
