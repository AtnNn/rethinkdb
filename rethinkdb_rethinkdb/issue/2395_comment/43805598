      "`r.expr(1)` is basically our ping.\r\nWe could add commands similar to what @JamesS237 wrote to the drivers to encapsulate this. Would that be useful?\r\n\r\nA small problem with this is that if there's a long running query, the \"ping\" will not be processed before that query has finished processing on the server. Changing this will require some deeper changes on the server side."
