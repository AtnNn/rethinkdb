      "Based on the APIs I've seen, I think `r.ping()` could look something like this:\r\n\r\nJavascript\r\n```javascript\r\nr.ping() // -> returns true or returns false and throws an error\r\nr.connected() // -> returns true or false, but doesn't throw an error if failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nRuby\r\n```ruby\r\nr.ping # -> returns true or returns false and throws an error\r\nr.connected? # -> returns true or false, but doesn't throw an error if failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython\r\n```python\r\nr.ping() # -> returns true or returns false and throws an error\r\nr.connected() # -> returns true or false, but doesn't throw an error if failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving separate `ping` and `connected` command would be good, because there is only some cases where an error is useful, and it would be annoying to have to wrap it in a try/catch each time.\r\n\r\nJust my thoughts on this command.
