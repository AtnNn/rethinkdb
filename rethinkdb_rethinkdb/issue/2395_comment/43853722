      "@JamesS237 -- you need to ping the same connection. \r\n\r\nOne reason you want to ping a specific connection is because if a tcp connection is idled for too long, the OS may close it.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes -- I think it's safe to ping a connection that is already being used as long as you don't ping it at the same time as you write a query on it. At least it's safe to ping a connection with the JavaScript driver even if a query is running on it."
