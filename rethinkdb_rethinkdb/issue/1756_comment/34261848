      "Up in review 1189 assigned to @mglukhovsky \r\nBranch michel_1756_live_status\r\n\r\nA table is \"Live\" only if every shards have enough replicas up to date to meet the number of acks required, which mean a table can be \"Live\" even if it's replicating.\r\n\r\nThe number of master/replicas reachable in the profile view (first section) is the number of shards/replicas own by a machine that we can reach.\r\nI renamed shards/replicas reachable in the sections below to shards/replicas available since in this case we check if we can use them or not.\r\n\r\nI also fixed a bug for unsatisfiable goal in my commit in case universe is master (we forgot to add 1 in this case)."
