      "Thank you for the report @marshall007.\r\nWe will look into extending the auto completion to work correctly inside of function bodies.\r\n\r\nI don't think we can (easily) deduce the exact set of possible types of a function argument. My impression is that simply assuming that every function argument (including `r.row`) is bound to a datum would work in most common cases though.\r\n\r\nIn the worst case I think we should rather show no completion hints at all than showing those for the parent term. However I think we can do better than that."
