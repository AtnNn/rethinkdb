        "I have 3 nodes of rethinkdb version 2.1.5 in my cluster. I want to upgrade them to version 2.2 with zero downtime. There are some limitations prevent me from achieving that goal:\r\n1. Need to restart node, lead to disconnect from the cluster one by one.\r\n2. New version instance cannot join cluster with older version. Once 1 node down and up with new version, it is disconnected forever from old cluster.\r\n\r\nBeen searching for answer of this question without result, so I posted my own here, hoping for a strategy to achieve the goal, or at least limit as much downtime as possible."
