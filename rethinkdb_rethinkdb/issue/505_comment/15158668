      "Hey,\r\n\r\nI'm having a little bit of trouble reproducing this on our end.  Is there any chance you could give us a copy of your dataset?  Also, would you mind reproducing the crash with `top` running and letting us know how much memory is being consumed when the server crashes?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
