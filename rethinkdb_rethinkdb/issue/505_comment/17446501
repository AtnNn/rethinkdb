      "The numbers here are a very rough aggregate by hand. I culled a few things that were too small, and Massif culled a few things at my request. The data feels very sound to me, so we can figure out where the rest of the memory is coming from.\r\n\r\nI basically agree with your assessment -- let's rerun this on 1.5 when it's out and work on optimizing that. It should be reasonably easy with instrumentation. (I also installed massif-visualize on newton that gives pretty and very large graphs that I have no chance of reading on my tiny screen with the scroll speed of X over the internet).\r\n\r\nI'll still try to get Instruments to work, but this might be good enough (tm)."
