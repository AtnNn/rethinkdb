      "Hey guys, since this has taken a while to resolve and we still can't reproduce the issue, here's what I propose we do:\r\n\r\n1. Grab the dataset (in a private, secure fashion) from @presidentbeef. We'd be happy to sign the NDA if necessary.\r\n2. Grab the exact, minimal query that reproduces the issue on @presidentbeef's system.\r\n3. Have someone on our side (@neumino or @mlucy, depending on who has the time?) run the specific query on the specific dataset on our side (on 1.3.x and 1.4.x versions to compare behavior and memory usage).\r\n\r\nWe can then go from there. @mglukhovsky -- could you provide @presidentbeef with a way to get us the dataset and query information?"
