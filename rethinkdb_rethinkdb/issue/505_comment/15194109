      "I think you are right. I reran using `r(\"key\").eq(\"value\")` and memory usage went up to ~480MB and took a few minutes (sorry, don't know exact time), but the process didn't crash. I'm seeing the same behavior as in the issue above, where the web server becomes unresponsive until the query finishes, and then when it does reload the query results are not displayed."
