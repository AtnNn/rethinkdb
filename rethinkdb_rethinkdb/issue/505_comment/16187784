      "After getting this to reproduce reliably I identified several issues linked to this one. One of the main culprits I've already fixed (though this is still in code review). Unfortunately, it seems that there is something else going on that we still haven't figured out yet.\r\n\r\nI am presently trying to get the tcmalloc heap profiler to work properly (and document how I did so this time). With this tool up and running I hope to identify where the extra memory use is coming from when I run `filter(lambda x: False)`. With this information I hope that we can finally identify the source of the problem and fix it."
