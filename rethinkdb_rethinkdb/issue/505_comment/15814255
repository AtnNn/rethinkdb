      "I want to chime in with how I see this. As @wmrowan mentioned, there are multiple unrelated issues here that need to be fixed that work together to cause this bug. While some of them will be fixed very soon, it will take some time to fix them all (probably on the order of two months).\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we'll work to get you a solution for your specific issue (the 3x memory usage increase) ASAP. Now that we were finally able to reproduce the problem, it'll take us a couple of days to figure out where the increase is coming from. We'll be able to tell you how soon we can fix it then.\r\n\r\nI'm really sorry this is taking so long, but unfortunately this is very pernicious and requires a lot of hard work (which we're more than willing to do -- it's just time consuming). There are no shortcuts here. Thanks for sticking around and helping us through this!"
