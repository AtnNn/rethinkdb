      "So it would appear as though some other fishy thing is going on here. When I run `r.table('reports').filter(lambda x: False).run()` as the first operation on the table it uses up all of memory and crashes. When I run some other operation on the table first (like `r.table('reports').count()`) then the filter query only pushes the memory high water mark up to about the same level as any other query that accesses the whole table.\r\n\r\nSince there are so many interlocking issues (and mysteries!) in this I'm going to open separate issues for each of the problems we know about so we can begin fixing them. I'll keep investigating and reporting here until we're sure that we found all the problems exposed by this."
