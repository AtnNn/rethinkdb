      "You said there are about 4k rows, right?  Any idea of the average row size?\r\n\r\nAlso, do you happen to know roughly how much memory this workload took in the old version?  (If not, that's cool; we can test it.)\r\n\r\nWe have a bunch of performance improvements slated for 1.6, and unfortunately we might not get time to fix this memory-usage regression until then.  I realize it's probably a pain, but if it's feasible then the easiest way around this right now might be to bump up the RAM on your machine."
