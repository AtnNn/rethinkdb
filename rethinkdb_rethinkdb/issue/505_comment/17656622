      "Great news, I just retested the workload and the fix for #672 has an added benefit of cutting memory usage by a factor of 2-3 depending on the query! This is in next and will be a part of the 1.5 release that should be available next week. Thanks again for being patient with us through this process and helping out with all the invaluable debugging information. I'm sorry this took so long!\r\n\r\n(We can still do a lot of memory optimization, but we're going to open separate issues for dealing with specific problems as they arise)"
