      "Ok, finally a bit of a breakthrough -- I got the stacktraces to work with Motiff's profiler. The following gist is Motiff's output on @president_beef's data when I run filter(lambda x: False) on his table -- https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/5519709 on peak snapshot (e.g. when most memory was used). Finally got the data out of these darned tools!"
