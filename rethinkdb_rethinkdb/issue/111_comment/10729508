      "Not sure if you guys had this discussion already (if so, please disregard this), but object equality isn't enough to implement this. We need to implement a comparison class for json data to make this work. This isn't particularly difficult (we discussed an acceptable comparator definition in one of our working groups), but I thought I'd mention it for posterity.\r\n\r\nAlso, this will automagically fix #103 when it's done."
