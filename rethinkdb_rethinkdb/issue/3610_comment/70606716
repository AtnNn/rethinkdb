      "TestApproximateWaitTimes appears to be because our nap function is only accurate to within about 25% on short wait times like this; for very small wait times (1 ms) it can be as much as 50%.  I have corrected it to pick 25% or 2 ms, whichever is larger, but I don't know for certain this will address the issue.\r\n\r\nTable of %s on my OS X box follows:\r\n\r\nWait time (in ms) | Percentage deviation\r\n-------------------- | ---------------------------\r\n1 | 18.6483\r\n1 | 2.78776\r\n2 | 2.07043\r\n5 | 2.88007\r\n3 | 2.30791\r\n3 | 5.80863\r\n2 | 19.1259\r\n5 | 0.567125\r\n13 | 14.992\r\n20 | 2.92692\r\n40 | 0.120976\r\n30 | 10.3766\r\n30 | 3.06756\r\n20 | 0.291125\r\n8 | 0.632363\r\n40 | 0.245048\r\n13 | 2.25883\r\n1 | 17.6654\r\n1 | 3.12237\r\n8 | 12.0125"
