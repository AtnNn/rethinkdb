      "I think that while we can prescriptively specify an official pronunciation, the descriptive pronunciation will ultimately win out. To date, people have picked \"requel\".\r\n\r\nHere's a fun blog post on the same confusion for SQL (\"sequel\" vs \"s-q-l\"): http://patorjk.com/blog/2012/01/26/pronouncing-sql-s-q-l-or-sequel/\r\n\r\nMy personal opinion: I think that when describing the query language to someone, pronouncing it as \"requel\" helps bridge the gap from SQL, given that it sounds so similar. Pronouncing it as \"recall\" is clever, but ultimately the community will decide which is right."
