      "Hi @barosl. Nothing would make us happier than to have you as a user, but we're all busy with testing and adding final touches, so I don't know if I can carve out Python 3 time this release. That being said, it should be very simple to clone the Python driver and port it to Python 3, and probably a bit harder to modify the Python driver to work with both languages. Would you like to give it a try?\r\n\r\nIf you clone the driver and port it to Python 3, you could release it as a community driver, and if you make the driver work with both languages, you could submit a pull request for us to merge. That would be great!\r\n\r\nFYI, here is the python driver directory -- https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/tree/next/drivers/python. If you decide to do this, please feel free to ask any questions -- we'd love to help and will be eternally grateful.\r\n\r\nSorry this isn't an ideal answer, but it's the best we can do at the moment.\r\n\r\nRelated to #1822."
