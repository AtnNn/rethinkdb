        "I think this is a superficial bug.  One of the connection tests appears to be failing because there's a server started at 28015 on Newton, for example:\r\n```python\r\n    def test_connect(self):\r\n        self.assertRaisesRegexp(\r\n            RqlDriverError, \"Could not connect to localhost:28015.\",\r\n            r.connect)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should probably just remove that one.  I'm not sure about the others, but these were probably introduced from merging in all the minor RQL changes and I think @wmrowan is more qualified to fix them.\r\n\r\nThe polyglot tests are still working fine."
