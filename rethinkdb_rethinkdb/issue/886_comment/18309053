      "So `with_fields` is just `pluck` that is not strict about field existence? That sounds reasonable. This would follow the pattern of supporting pairs of commands for strict behavior vs. non-strict behavior. See my comments on #885. If we do choose this pattern we should make sure that we're consistent with it across the API. I'd rather have a consistent flag for switching between strict and non-strict behavior than do that in some places and this in others."
