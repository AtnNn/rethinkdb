      "Ok, this has gotten a bit confusing. Let me try to summarize.\r\n\r\n* `pluck` on an object will exclude fields not given but will not guarantee the existence of fields given\r\n* `pluck` on a sequence is just `map(pluck)`\r\n* `with_fields` is only defined on sequences and is equivalent to:\r\n```\r\nsequence.filter(r.row.has_fields(*fields)).pluck(*fields)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like this proposal was designed to deal with the fact that `pluck` would throw on malformed data and is less useful with a more permissive pluck."
