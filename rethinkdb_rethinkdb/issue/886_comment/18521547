      "I agree that `with_fields` is somewhat less useful in the context of the following two changes:\r\n\r\n* `pluck` no longer throwing when an attribute is missing\r\n* `filter` no longer throwing when an attribute is missing\r\n\r\nI'd still prefer to include it because I can definitely see myself using it, and it's more convenient than `.has_fields(a).pluck(a)`."
