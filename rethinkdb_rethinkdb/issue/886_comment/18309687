      "`with_fields` is `pluck` on a stream that drops rows where those fields don't exist.  (It would also take the same `including_nulls` optional argument as `has_fields`.)\r\n\r\nActually, the current behavior for `pluck` (throwing when an attribute is missing) seems incorrect to me.  In issues #338 and #570 other people seem to think that we should make it not throw as well.  Would anyone object to just fixing that as part of this issue?"
