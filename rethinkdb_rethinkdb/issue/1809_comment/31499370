      "@wojons -- Unfortunately I don't think this would work too well. Access to cluster means we have to address this issue immediately, and we can't easily recompile/restart nodes using our internal tools and infrastructure that we regularly do for debugging.\r\n\r\nCould you give some information about how the cluster is set up?\r\n\r\n* What hardware do you use? Is this on EC2/private hardware/etc. Do all the nodes have the same hardware or different?\r\n* What network connectivity do you use? Are all the nodes in the same datacenter/different datacenters/etc.?\r\n* What do various other nodes in the cluster report? (is it one node that reports issues, or do many nodes have inconsistencies)\r\n\r\nWe'll try to replicate this locally soon, but it would help to have a bit more information."
