      "@neumino all the machines were up i was on a web ui of a different machine then the one reporting errors that was a diferent machine then was saying it was down. But for what ever reason web ui says everything is fine process says its running but admin panel says no. I am not sure if this data is in the logs. I know some databases they have a method of a log line that looks like.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMachine X thinks i am down\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach machine i guess is reporting to all the other machines so they all know who can and cant see what i am sure it can be used for querying also but its great for trying to debug network parations.
