      "> They can also make a typo when they use `table_create` anyway.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, that's different. If I make a typo during `table_create`, and then access the table with a correct name, I'll get an error, figure out why, and fix it. If the table is created implicitly, two scenarios might happen:\r\n\r\n- I might insert into a table again with a correct name, and now I have two tables with different documents.\r\n- I might try to read from the table and get an error (or worse, nothing, if reads implicitly create a table)\r\n\r\n"
