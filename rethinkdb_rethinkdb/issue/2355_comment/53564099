      "What I'd like to see, and it seems related to the issue so I'm throwing it in here, is for ``table_create`` to just be a noop if the table already exists.\r\n\r\nThat way, I can define all the tables I need at the start up of my application, without needing a separate database setup script. This might just be an option in the client library, and might functionally not be much different from catching and ignoring the exception."
