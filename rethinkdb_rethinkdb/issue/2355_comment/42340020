      "The point of having flexible schema is that you don't have to set up a schema and you can just start programming.\r\nThe same applies for table creation. Having to write a little script or having to go to the web ui to create a table is not a good experience.\r\n\r\nIf people make a typo, they can just delete the table. They can also make a typo when they use `table_create` anyway."
