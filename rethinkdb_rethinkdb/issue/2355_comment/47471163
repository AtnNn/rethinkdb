      "Thanks @brettgriffin for the feedback!\r\nI also think that the cost of people abusing table creating outweighs the case of most of our users who just want to write code and not open the web interface/command line to create a table.\r\n\r\nThinky does create the table under the hood and while I was a little reluctant in doing it at the beginning, it makes using thinky sooooooo much better.\r\n\r\nThe tricky part in the implementation is described here - https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2259\r\nAnd the workaround used in thinky can break in a multithreaded environment (I think)"
