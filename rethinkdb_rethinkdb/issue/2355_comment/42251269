      "A major downside of this is that if people make a typo in their script, they'll just blindly create and start populating a new table.\r\n\r\nIt's also generally a bad idea to do expensive operations automatically -- this makes table creation look cheap and automatic, which might lead to people making hundreds of tables, which we don't support well right now.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is pretty nice when you're playing around in the REPL."
