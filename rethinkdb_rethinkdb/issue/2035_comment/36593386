      "Actually, thinking about this more, I'm not sure we can solve this correctly without either:\r\n* Implementing an `error` type rather than using exceptions for error handling.\r\n* Using condition handlers (or something similar) instead of exceptions for error handling.\r\n\r\nSo this might be a bigger change than I thought.  (I'm basically convinced at this point that an error type is better than exception handling, so we should do that at some point.)"
