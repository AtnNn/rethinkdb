      "This will not make it into the release unless @mlucy you have a better idea than mine. I started implementing this behaviour but it goes against the current flow of the query language code, it touches a lot of code and it changes where exceptions are caught, which is hard to check and may introduce subtle bugs. My attempts are in the `atnnn/2035` branch."
