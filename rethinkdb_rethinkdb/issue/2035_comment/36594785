      "> `seq.group('a').filter{|row| row.has_field('b')}.map{|row| row['b']}`, which is the same as `seq.filter{|row| row.has_field('b')}.group('a').map{|row| row['b']}`\r\n\r\nI don't think this transformation is actually reasonable. Assuming no rows have a field `b`, my intuitive understanding is that the former should return a bunch of groups that map to empty arrays, where as the latter should return no groups.\r\n\r\nI don't see why it has to be 100x worse if we clearly define what we expect."
