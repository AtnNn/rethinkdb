      "So, this is actually sort of hard to do.  `r.expr([{a:null}]).group('a')('a').sum()` returns a grouped stream -- to make `default` operate on the elements of the groups, we'd have to make a `default` terminal that gets distributed to the shards.  That's very doable, but it isn't a quick fix."
