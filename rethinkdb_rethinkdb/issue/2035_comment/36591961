      "I think it should still be done, especially because we removed the base argument to reduce.\r\n\r\nFor example, users writing custom reductions will use `default` to set the base. But if those reductions are applied to a grouped_stream, the default will be floated out, it will catch unrelated, legitimate errors, causing it to return the default value, which will break the query because the next item in the chain expects a grouped_objects but gets a datum instead."
