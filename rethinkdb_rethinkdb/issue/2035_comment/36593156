      "That's a bug in next that's fixed in the 2028_2030_aggregator_improvements branch (currently in code review by @Tryneus .)\r\n\r\nThe problem still exists for certain expressions (e.g. if you do `r.expr([{a: 1}]).group('a').do{|x| x}` to force the type into GROUPED_DATA), but it isn't nearly as bad.\r\n\r\nI think you mentioned before that you wanted to try implementing this yourself; if you still do, 2028_2030_aggregator_improvements is stable enough that you could branch off it."
