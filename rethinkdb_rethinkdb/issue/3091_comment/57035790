      "Basically we do not expose the primitives enough to save the user from this (in particular we offer no union or intersection primitives) largely because we have not chosen to wrap the `S2Region` classes; since the intersection or union of polygons can be weird I don't see a way to get S2 to compute the intersection operation for us without it being far more general than we can really cope with at the moment.  Essentially, this is a WONTFIX until we develop a more complete encoding of all S2 ephemera, which may or may not happen."
