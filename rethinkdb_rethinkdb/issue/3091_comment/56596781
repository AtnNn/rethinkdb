      "`r.polygon([0,0], [0,1], [1.1,1]).polygonSub(r.polygon([0.4,0.4], [0.4,0.5], [0.5,0.5]))` works, which avoids the line segment issue.  This is therefore not a 1.15 issue by my reckoning, although I would still like something a little clearer.  This sort of issue is a horrible nest of difficulties in geometry libraries, however, so I am not confident that it can be done completely."
