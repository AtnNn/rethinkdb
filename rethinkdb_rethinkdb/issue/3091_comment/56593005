      "It may be reasonable for S2 to refuse this, as the line segment from [0.5,0.5] to [0.4,0.4] is a subset of the line segment from [1,1] to [0,0]; that is, the second triangle is not *strictly contained* within the former.  I asked @neumino to make an issue for this so I can investigate whether this is purely that issue or something more serious."
