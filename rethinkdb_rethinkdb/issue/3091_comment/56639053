      "There are a couple things I want to investigate under the aegis of this issue:\r\n- [x] whether the intersection of these two triangles is also illegal for `polygonSub` (it really shouldn't be)\r\n- [x] whether or not we should just do the intersection operation ourselves.  (that is, A - B \8803 A - (A \8745 B), but the latter equation can be easier to work with)"
