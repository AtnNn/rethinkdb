      "@analytik - when importing data from a higher version of rethinkdb into a lower version, secondary indexes cannot be imported.  You can specify this by passing `--no-secondary-indexes` to the `restore` or `import` command.  Granted, the server should not crash due to a bad query and we should fix this.\r\n\r\nI don't see such a simple explanation for the crash on 2.3.0, however.  Since it's happening in sindex post-construction, this may also be sindex-related."
