      "There can be a lot of factors that determine disk space, and rebuilding indexes certainly contributes to a higher disk usage (though it should be temporary). For example the speed of the disks also has an impact on how big the files will get, since it affects the efficiency of the garbage collector.\r\n\r\nHaving to rebuild indexes on one but not the other sounds odd. The only reason I can think of would be them running different versions of RethinkDB, or restoring from a different backup?\r\n\r\nAre they both on the same version? Did you use the exact same backup file to restore?"
