      "One thing to keep in mind is that the `fold` query will cause more network overhead and parallelize less well compared to the `group.count` query, because all data will be sent to a single server which performs the `fold`, while `.group.count` will be spread out over all shards.\r\nSo it's basically a trade-off between network efficiency and parallelism on the one, and memory consumption on the other hand."
