      Just
        "```\nr.now().typeOf() => \"PSEUDOTYPE(TIME)\"\n```\n\nI think the word \"pseudotype\" is leaking an unnecessary amount of information for the following reasons:\n1. Users won't necessary understand (or care for) the difference between types and pseudotypes\n2. If they do understand/care, I think it would be better to just return the type and document with types are pseudotypes elsewhere\n3. Type comparison becomes a bit of a pain. I wanted to get all rows where a certain attribute is a date, and typing this whole string was very unwieldy.\n\nTL;DR: I think we should return \"TIME\" instead.\n\nThoughts?\n"
