      "To answer the queries from @coffeemug :\r\n\r\n* I believe so, but it's a bit early to tell. Here is a graph of the memory usage on that shard for the last 12 hours: \r\n![q5ornz_7iyrvjy0kuiq7aspf4hpzxdz1gaie8cfluns](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/660139/4094647/7bf1d73c-2faa-11e4-92d5-9b1067b172b4.png) \r\n The restart is rather apparent. The memory usage seems to be creeping back up but with only ~6 hours of data it's not much to identify a trend.\r\n* Sure, if you think that would help and it is kept private. We have not yet moved any user sensitive data to RethinkDB yet so it's mostly not sensitive data but our privacy policy forbids us from sharing any information unless it is kept private. Let me know what I need to do.\r\n* I can try to whip something up like this with a handful of the queries that we do against that data."
