      "> The only thing other than `r.js` and `r.http` that uses external worker processes is general disk i/o.\r\n\r\nI was under the impression that that's done in threads, not processes. Did I get this wrong?\r\n\r\nAlso, we should add a safety net to make sure the kernel kills child processes when the parent dies via `prctl`. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/284325/how-to-make-child-process-die-after-parent-exits for Linux (and I'm sure OS X has a similar construct)."
