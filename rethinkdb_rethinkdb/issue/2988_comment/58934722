      "@danielmewes Thanks for your ongoing work on this!\r\n\r\nWould the custom binary be basically the latest stable version with just this tweak? Or an unstable latest version?\r\n\r\nWe only have the issue in production where we have the cluster and high load so I'm hesitant to install a potentially unstable build, but if it has a very low chance of data corruption or other bugginess, I am fine with the experiment."
