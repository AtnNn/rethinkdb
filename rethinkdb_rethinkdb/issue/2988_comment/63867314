      "For everyone who is following this:\r\nThanks to @victorquinn 's ongoing help in tracking this down and testing different patches and theories, we have finally arrived at something that so far looks very promising. It seems that switching to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2279 solves this issue.\r\n\r\nThe original issue isn't reproducible in all cases. It might depend on a very specific workload, or maybe it only happens with certain versions of TCMalloc. So far it looks like switching to Jemalloc is our safest bet though."
