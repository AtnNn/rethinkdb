      "Thanks @victorquinn for the report! A few additional questions:\r\n\r\n- Have you had any more memory issues since the restart? Is this issue reproducible or intermittent?\r\n- Would you be willing to privately share your data with us? (if you are @mglukhovsky can help set up a transfer)\r\n- I realize this might be difficult, but if the issue is reproducible, is there a minimal script you could construct that emulates the queries of your application?\r\n\r\nWe'll work hard to reproduce this internally, but any additional information helps speed up the debugging process immensely."
