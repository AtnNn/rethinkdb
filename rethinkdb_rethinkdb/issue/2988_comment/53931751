      "Regarding this question by @victorquinn:\r\n\r\n> Is there some convenient way to see from the RethinkDB side how many connections are opened to it?\r\n\r\nCurrently, no, the closest thing we have is in the perfmons in `/ajax/stat` (through the web interface), each server has a `query_language` field like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"query_language\": {\r\n    \"ops_running\": \"0\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ops_running` is the number of connections that are currently running an operation.\r\n\r\nI think we should add a couple more fields like `open_connections` and `cached_streams`, which would ease debugging in situations like this.  I could do this fairly easily if we wanted to put it in a point release."
