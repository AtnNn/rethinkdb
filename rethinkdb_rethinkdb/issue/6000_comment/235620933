      "One more idea: Since `upsert` is a general term known in other databases, people might be googling for exactly that. Removing the blog post from robots, or even altogether, doesn't really help users solve their problem. Perhaps it would be good to add a note about \"how to do upserts\" in the documentation page of the `insert` command API, actually mentioning the word `upsert`?"
