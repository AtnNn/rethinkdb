      "@niieani Good point.\r\nMaybe instead of hiding it from search engines, we should actually consider editing the blog post and adding a note in the actual contents of it to point to the new syntax.\r\n\r\nIndependently of that, I think we should have an \"upsert\" recipe in our cookbook. There are already a bunch of examples in there that are essentially upserts, but with additional logic.\r\nA plain \"Insert document, or update fields if it already exists\" recipe might be helpful, and we should make sure to use the term \"upsert\" to make it easier to discover from search engines.\r\nhttps://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/cookbook/javascript/#manipulating-documents\r\n\r\n@chipotle Could you take care of adding this to the cookbook?"
