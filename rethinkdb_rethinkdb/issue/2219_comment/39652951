      "@Tryneus here i was about to come and tell you that i figured out what the issue was and then i reload the page to see you have already left a comment on it. I do have one that was in there twice. Again this is one of those thigns where the server says it was started with out problem but it already crashed. Also not sure but would be better just to allow the same sever twice in my book better then hitting your head aganst the wall. or at least alert users. I think rethinkdb should add a config file check other things have it like nginx where you can run nginx -t and it tests the config file. even a simple python one would work good for starters"
