      "Ok, merged a fix for this into `next` in commit cf239fa, cherry-picked into `v1.12.x` in commit c026008.  Review was 1414. Will be in release 1.12.3, or 1.13.0, whichever comes first.  The new behavior is to print a warning if a duplicate --join parameter is found.\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting this @wojons!"
