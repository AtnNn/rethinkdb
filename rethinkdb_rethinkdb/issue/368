        "When we see issues like #350 and others, it's annoying that our file I/O error message just says that an I/O operation failed.  It should report the stringified errno value and also the file offset that we're reading from, and also what we know about the file size.  I'm sick of thinking \"This is presumably a read from off the end of the file (caused by corruption)\" when it could really be some weird device error or a completely bonkers offset caused by an offset value taken from uninitialized memory.\n\nThis is a straightforward problem to fix: propagate up the actual error information where before we propagated up a mere boolean, then print it.\n"
