      "Yeah, your first query is what I was thinking of.\r\n\r\n`dbList()` currently returns a string, so I don't think the `.info()` idea is practical. But you could do something like this:\r\n```js\r\nr.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"db_config\")\r\n    .filter(r.row(\"user_data\")(\"tags\").contains(\"my_tag\"))\r\n    .map(r.row(\"name\"))\r\n```\r\nI guess that's not much shorter."
