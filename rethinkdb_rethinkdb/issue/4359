        "The server still crashes. If I increase the required free stack size it eventually works with the test query from the `polyglot/regression/2639` test but fails again if I make the query more nested. If I had to guess, I'd say that something in the exception throwing or handling mechanism probably uses stack space that grows with the complexity of the query.\r\n\r\nI'll try to fix this before 2.0.3, but I think it's not critical for that release."
