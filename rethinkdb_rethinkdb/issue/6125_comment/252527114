      "Hmm.  Well, running `r.random` atomically doesn't work for me in `v2.3.5` or `next`.\r\n\r\nI think the cause of this bug is 47fe12a5fdeb27370b1079cb42b518e097b485f2.  See the changes to `src/rdb_protocol/time.cc`.  Previously, `r.now()` terms were turned into constant terms by replacing them in the AST (iirc). Now, they aren't.  The consequence is that `is_deterministic()`, called on such an expression, now produces a different result.\r\n\r\nI think we can't change the `is_deterministic()` behavior, because `r.now()` terms *didn't* get replaced in secondary index functions, and we call `is_deterministic()` to determine what is a valid secondary index function.  I'll have to look.  Edit:  Looked.  It does get called for that purpose."
