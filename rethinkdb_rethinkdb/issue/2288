        "The `reduce` command used to accept two arguments (a function and an optional base). We now dropped the optional base, but didn't change the JS driver to expect one argument instead of two. So old JS code calling `reduce` isn't erroring on the new server/driver. See #2287 for an example of the type of bugs people run into because of this.\n\n@neumino -- could you fix this and ask @atnnn to release a new version of the JS driver?\n"
