        "While running a query against a large table ( 150 Million docs, 1TB Disk usage, 9 shards) we expected to get the `Array over size limit 100000` but did not.  Subsequently every node on our cluster crashed due to oom_killer (memory usage).\r\n\r\nThe query being run was `r.db('prism').table('details').group({index: 'beaconId'}).ungroup().count()`\r\n\r\nThe table has a secondary index on beaconID\r\n\r\nThe current thought by @danielmewes is that \r\n\r\n> perhaps each group would be its own array, maybe that's why it's not working ?"
