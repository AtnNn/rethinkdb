      "Those are some nice commands, didn't know you could use `git log` on a directory. \r\nI've never had a chance to try out `git blame`.\r\n`git shortlog` looks nice.\r\n\r\nNow this is all nice and well, but once again not everyone knows how to do this, and not everyone has cloned the repo first. Really it comes down to how much you guys want to get others involved, and make on-boarding for contributors easy, which says a lot about a project."
