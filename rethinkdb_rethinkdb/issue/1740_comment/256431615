      "@AtnNn we should also consider tackling #3771 (i.e. adopting `rethinkdbdash` as the official JS driver) at the same time. I would imagine a trivial amount of work would need to go into updating the polyglot tests to run against `rethinkdbdash`. Once we start splitting out the repos, that would be an opportune time to do it."
