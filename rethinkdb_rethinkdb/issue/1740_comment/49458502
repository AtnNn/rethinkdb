      "The fact that the 3 supported drivers are part of the main repo is fantastic. \r\n\r\nI don't know what your internal sentiment is regarding long-term support for these drivers, but if you guys are committed to them, then having them right alongside the main source really speaks mountains about the RethinkDB emphasis on the developer. \r\n\r\nThe fact that you have to clone the whole repo to work on the drivers is also fantastic. I've never worked with a C++ codebase before, but I'll tell you this: I won't come any closer to working on a C++ codebase if I don't have one on my computer. Cloning a repo is easy, and it might take a bit more time, but at the end of the day it's trivial to clone a big repo vs. a small repo. When I do get that big repo after a few extra minutes of waiting, I then find myself encouraged to explore the other drivers and the server source. I love that."
