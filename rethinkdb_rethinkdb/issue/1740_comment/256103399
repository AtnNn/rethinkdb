      "Driver consistency is a huge plus to using RethinkDB. It would be great if that quality remained, whether via keeping it in a single repository, or some other process (merge criteria? clever CI? etc).\r\n\r\nI'd also worry about driver drift - what happens when (eg) the node community ends up adding a bunch of features that the other communities don't implement or don't agree with?"
