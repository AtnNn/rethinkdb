      "Hi @mmalecki,\r\n\r\nWe've talked about this before, and decided to leave the drivers in the main tree for the time being.  It makes life much easier for the server team, because:\r\n* When they add a new term or new functionality, they can add that term to the drivers and/or write tests for that functionality without getting multiple repositories involved.\r\n* They can run the driver-dependent tests without getting multiple repositories involved.\r\n* They know that they always have the right client for the version of the server they've checked out.\r\n  - This is **really** important when git bisecting across protocol changes.\r\n\r\nThe JS driver in particular is also used for the Web UI, so keeping them synced in the same repository is very important.\r\n\r\nWe may re-visit this decision once the pace of ReQL development slows.\r\n\r\nIs there anything we can do to make working with the drivers in the main RethinkDB repository more pleasant?  Is the primary obstacle the size of the `git clone`?"
