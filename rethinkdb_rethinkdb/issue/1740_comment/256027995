      "This issue has come up again. As RethinkDB moves to being a more community-driven project, we want to make it easier to contribute to the drivers, and perhaps have separate maintainers for them.\r\n\r\nI think those considerations outweigh the advantages of a monorepo with tight coupling.\r\n\r\nThis process would also blur the line between community drivers and official drivers. Previously, no feature was allowed to be merged unless it was supported in at least one driver, and no release was made until all four official drivers had feature parity.\r\n\r\nThe testsuite is also important to consider. Currently, tests for RethinkDB itself and for each official driver are mixed up together in an efficient but monolithic testsuite."
