      "Would love them moved out as well, makes it that much easier to contribute, and find the code. This has a lot to do with productivity, commit history, issues, PRs, etc. It's all merged together and that's a HUGE pain! Like I was just looking through the commit history, trying to find where Promise support was added to the Javascript driver, and I couldn't find anything.. almost 30k commits.\r\n\r\nAlso having dedicated contributors just for that driver."
