      "I tried changing `one_waiter_cond_t` to use `notify_sometime` instead of `notify_now_deprecated` - it was only being used in `static_semaphore_t::co_lock()` and `adjustable_semaphore_t::co_lock()`, both of which would perform a `coro_t::yield_ordered()` right after the `one_waiter_cond_t::wait()`.  I believe this means that users of the `semaphore_t`s already could not count on running immediately, and it is safe to use `notify_sometime` instead and drop the `coro_t::yield_ordered()`.\r\n\r\nI am not positive about this reasoning, but with this change, all the unittests and reql tests pass.  I am also running a few valgrind tests to see if anything suspicious shows up.\r\n"
