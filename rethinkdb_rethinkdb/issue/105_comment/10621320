      "The real_doc.json file is loaded as soon as everything is loaded (not just when the user go to the data explorer page).\r\n\r\nThe reason why the suggestions are not immediately displayed is because we download fonts only when the first suggestions are displayed. The two guilty files are\r\n```\r\n/fonts/inconsolata-regular-webfont.woff\r\n/fonts/inconsolata-bold-webfont.woff\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll check on how to preload them.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, it would be nice to have something to trim the file - like the python and ruby descriptions/examples. It would be even nicer since we are probably going to have more languages soon."
