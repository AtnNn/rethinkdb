      "@larkost I never actually tried running the tests with the newer versions. I've just been installing the required versions globally (since I assumed they had to be) and then reverting back to the newer versions after running the tests. This was getting annoying which is why I opened the issue. It's less important now that I understand how `--fetch` and `--allow-fetch` work."
