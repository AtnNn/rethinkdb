      "Yes `--fetch` and `--allow-fetch` download/install into an `external` folder inside the RethinkDB source folder. They do not mess with your global installs at all.\r\n\r\nWe usually make things use system versions by default and only grab remote items with explicit user say-so. This is both more efficient and removes the requirement of downloading things outside people's control (and issue both for some security policies as well as machines with internet connections). "
