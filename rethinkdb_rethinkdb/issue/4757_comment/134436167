      "Thanks for the PR @alexsalas . Would you mind taking out the changes that affect the `external` path (i.e. the v8 changes)?\r\n\r\nThat code comes from Google. I'd recommend submitting that patch directly to https://code.google.com/p/v8/ .\r\n\r\nHave you signed our CLA yet? http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/"
