        "When json_cmp was recursing in object compare due to two identical keys, it was returning the same result for `l < r` and `l > r`.  This was due to the coercion of the result of `json_cmp` to a bool, where `json_cmp` can return -1, 0, or 1.  Thus, a result of -1 was returning true (correct), a result of 0 was returning false (correct), and a result of 1 was returning true (incorrect).\n\nThis commit fixes that by performing the correct conversion to a bool.\n\nAlso, some std::strings were using in the comparison function, which I've changed to char *s, as they are in the original objects, to reduce allocation.\n"
