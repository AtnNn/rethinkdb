There are a lot of cases where the overhead of returning the entire result set on each change would be worth it for the sake of simplicity. For example if I want the top 5 users by score the performance impact of emitting all five rows on every change is minimal and I'd like to avoid writing the code necessary to keep my in-memory copy in sync/sorted correctly."
