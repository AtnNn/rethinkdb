      "@mlucy -- Before running the `avg` query, I think I run it with `sum`/`min`/`max` too. I think the one just before was `min`.\r\n\r\nAlso, it was on the data explorer, so maybe I accidentally click twice on `run` and thus closed the connection and canceled the query.\r\nI haven't been able to reproduce it though."
