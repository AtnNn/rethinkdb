Haploid further said that the server would not use more than 18.3% CPU.\r\n\r\nI personally think that we can rule out the driver as the bottleneck here, as soft durable inserts seem to run a lot faster (even though they are still slowish, but that's likely independent of the issue here).\r\n\r\nDo we have any machine running OS X that has an SSD for reproducing the issue?"
