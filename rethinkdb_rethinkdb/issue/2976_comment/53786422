      "Here are all the explanations I can think of:\r\n\r\n* Somehow the rebuilt index was a valid FUNC term, but resulted in errors on every row, which would make the secondary index btree empty.\r\n* The query used was somehow not correct for the rebuilt index.  This could be verified by checking if there were any entries in the rebuilt index (like with a simple `order_by(index='idx')`).\r\n* The index somehow got changed to a `multi` index.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how any of these could happen without memory corruption, but I would say the first is the most plausible."
