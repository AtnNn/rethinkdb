      "@danielmewes thanks again for your patience, this is sounding better and better :)\r\n\r\nMy next question is related to indexing, by default Elasticsearch with its Lucene shards indexes everything by default, and a common pattern would be to dump everything into an \"index\" (read db, mostly called logstash-YYYY-MM-DD) and use filters to quickly find all docs with certain tags/keywords for a certain time-range, then run aggregations on those.\r\n\r\nMy intuition is that with RethinkDB instead of dumping everything into one table one would create a table per 'data-source', then make the timestamp the primary key. I think I read that it indexes the primary key by default. Lets imagine I'm saving a bunch of syslog messages, primary key is the timestamp, then I have a 'message', a 'service' and a 'host' field. If I want to do something like \"Give me the count of messages by host and then by service\", would it make any sense to add additional indexes to the 'host' or 'service' fields?\r\n\r\nI might then subscribe to that query and send updated 'count by host by service' messages to a front-end dashboard.\r\n\r\nProducts like Splunk and Elasticsearch then go one step further and create new 'buckets'/'tables'/'indexes' at a semi regular interval (maybe once a day), to assist with closing out and archiving old analytics data - does that model map to RethinkDB (and not seriously break something)?\r\n"
