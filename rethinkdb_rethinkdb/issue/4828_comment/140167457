      "Hi @stephanbuys,\r\nRethinkDB can generally handle large data sets. However there are a few limitations to be aware of. Firstly, RethinkDB is primarily optimized for SSD storage. With large data sets on rotational drives, you might see reduced performance for analytical queries. Secondly, there is a memory overhead of about 2-5% of the total data size (#1951).\r\n\r\nRethinkDB doesn't currently have good built-in full-text search. We typically recommend replicating the data into ElasticSearch, and using that for full-text indexing (see http://rethinkdb.com/docs/elasticsearch/). "
