      "For a query like \"Give me the count of messages by host and then by service\" it's not really necessary to add a special index. Since all data will have to be traversed anyway to get the final result, the index doesn't significantly reduce the amount of data the query has to look at in this case.\r\nIndexes are most useful if your query only selects a small part of the data, and you can use the index to efficiently filter the data accordingly.\r\n\r\nNote that you cannot subscribe to queries of this type directly yet, though we're working on it (see #1118). You can simulate a changefeed on such a query by getting a changefeed on the whole underlying table, and updating the counts on the client whenever a document in the table gets changed/inserted/deleted.\r\n\r\nYou can definitely use a similar architecture for archiving data periodically with RethinkDB, and I know that some people are using such a system. You will just need to implement the logic for moving data over yourself."
