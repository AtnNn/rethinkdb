        "EDIT: I (@coffeemug) am doing 4 -- 6, @mglukhovsky will work with @atnnn and @al3xandru to do the rest.\r\n\r\nI'm consolidating various doc/1.4-related issues here (I'm doing all this in one batch and it's easier for me to just cross things out):\r\n\r\n1. ~~The cluster startup guide (http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guides/startup/) needs to be updated with the modifications from #251, #250 and #188.~~\r\n2. ~~In the election tutorial, the `orderby` function should be `orderBy`.~~\r\n3. ~~In quickstart guides, we need to drop `.run()` because the data explorer no longer accepts it.~~\r\n4. ~~In client driver docs (and elsewhere), update things to use `.repl()` and move `from rethinkdb import r` to `import rethinkdb as r`.~~\r\n5. ~~Update the API page (obviously).~~\r\n6. ~~Update the data explorer help.~~\r\n7. Update the front page with the new release version/links (if necessary).\r\n8. ~~Update build from source/brew instructions.~~\r\n9. ~~Merge the blog post announcement into the site.~~\r\n10. ~~Updating the tutorial for the new API~~\r\n11. ~~Updating superheroes tutorial (Python API)~~\r\n\r\nHere are some specific API changes consolidated from other issues (this list is incomplete):\r\n\r\n1. ~~Docs claim `reduce` takes two arguments, but it only takes one~~\r\n2. ~~Ditto for GMR~~\r\n3. ~~`del` has been renamed to `delete`~~\r\n4. ~~`get` doesn't accept optional id~~\r\n5. ~~ditto for between~~\r\n6. ~~ditto for eqjoin~~\r\n7. ~~The whole `letVar`/`do` business~~\r\n8. ~~Polymorphism for object functions~~\r\n9. ~~Docs for `corce_to` (and drop stream conversions funcs)~~\r\n10. ~~JS connection api changes (i.e. `(err, res)` callback sigs, `toArray`, `next`, `each` and `hasNext`)~~\r\n11. ~~`.repl()` for ruby and python~~\r\n12. ~~document using `r.js(\"(function() {})\")` for passing values to JavaScript (and note the parens)~~\r\n13. ~~document the changes to global optional arguments~~"
