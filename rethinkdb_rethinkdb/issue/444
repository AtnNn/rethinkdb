        "EDIT: I (@coffeemug) am doing 4 -- 6, @mglukhovsky will work with @atnnn and @al3xandru to do the rest.\n\nI'm consolidating various doc/1.4-related issues here (I'm doing all this in one batch and it's easier for me to just cross things out):\n1. ~~The cluster startup guide (http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guides/startup/) needs to be updated with the modifications from #251, #250 and #188.~~\n2. ~~In the election tutorial, the `orderby` function should be `orderBy`.~~\n3. ~~In quickstart guides, we need to drop `.run()` because the data explorer no longer accepts it.~~\n4. ~~In client driver docs (and elsewhere), update things to use `.repl()` and move `from rethinkdb import r` to `import rethinkdb as r`.~~\n5. ~~Update the API page (obviously).~~\n6. ~~Update the data explorer help.~~\n7. Update the front page with the new release version/links (if necessary).\n8. ~~Update build from source/brew instructions.~~\n9. ~~Merge the blog post announcement into the site.~~\n10. ~~Updating the tutorial for the new API~~\n11. ~~Updating superheroes tutorial (Python API)~~\n\nHere are some specific API changes consolidated from other issues (this list is incomplete):\n1. ~~Docs claim `reduce` takes two arguments, but it only takes one~~\n2. ~~Ditto for GMR~~\n3. ~~`del` has been renamed to `delete`~~\n4. ~~`get` doesn't accept optional id~~\n5. ~~ditto for between~~\n6. ~~ditto for eqjoin~~\n7. ~~The whole `letVar`/`do` business~~\n8. ~~Polymorphism for object functions~~\n9. ~~Docs for `corce_to` (and drop stream conversions funcs)~~\n10. ~~JS connection api changes (i.e. `(err, res)` callback sigs, `toArray`, `next`, `each` and `hasNext`)~~\n11. ~~`.repl()` for ruby and python~~\n12. ~~document using `r.js(\"(function() {})\")` for passing values to JavaScript (and note the parens)~~\n13. ~~document the changes to global optional arguments~~\n"
