      "You can generally use `r.expr` just fine in such functions. You cannot (should not) use the connection object in there, but that's different from `r`. I think your first code snippet should work fine (except that `hero('city')` should be `doc('city')`, right?).\r\n\r\nI think the `in` command might be useful regardless.\r\n\r\nWhile you can always do `r.expr(...).contains(...)` instead, the structure for that is different from what a lot of people expect (especially when coming from other query languages).\r\n\r\nMarking as a ReQL proposal so we can discuss it at some point in the future."
