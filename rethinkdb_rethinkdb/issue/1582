        "I thought we had fixed this, but apparently not.  In Ruby we have this behavior:\r\n```\r\nirb(main):1044:0> (r(1) & r(2) < r(3) & r(4)).run\r\nArgumentError: Calling < on result of infix bitwise operator:\r\nr(3).all(4).\r\nThis is almost always a precedence error.\r\nNote that `a < b | b < c` <==> `a < (b | b) < c`.\r\nIf you really want this behavior, use `.or` or `.and` instead.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should have the same behavior in Python (we should detect and error on common precedence errors).\r\n\r\nScheduling for subsequent because I think this is a common and extremely confusing error case, and it's a few lines of Python to fix it."
