      "@danielmewes -- the new implementation sounds like a really good idea. I do have a question -- does it address starvation? I haven't looked at the code, but from the description it sounds like on a live system a low priority coroutine may never run. This is a pretty serious issue that may not show up in testing, I think it's something a new implementation should address (presumably by temporarily bumping the priority if a coroutine hasn't been scheduled for too long)."
