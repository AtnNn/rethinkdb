      "Actually we would likely have to work down to their children, children's children etc., without knowing exactly which ones we should pick. We do not know which child (a better word would probably be callee) the coroutine was actually processing at the time it took so long to yield.\r\n\r\nLike in the message handling example, all we would know is that the slow coroutine would be one which was launched to handle a message. If it handled message type a, that coroutine would internally call another function handle_a(). For message type b, it would call handle_b() and so on. We cannot find out through this kind of analysis which handle function we should take a closer look at. And from what I've seen it doesn't get much easier from that point down.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it could still give us rough hints on where to start looking."
