      "@jdoliner: The only hint I have is that I get a call trace when the limit is hit. Statistically, the place which first hits the limit has an elevated chance of being the source of many of the coroutines.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus: I will try printing the running_coroutine_counts. The MAX_CHUNKS_OUT parameter is also interesting. Maybe that could be tuned."
