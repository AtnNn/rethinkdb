      "Yeah I also thought about that. It might be useful.\r\n\r\nAs far as I see, it could only tell us where the respective coroutines were started though. It would not tell us where they actually spend their time, which for some coroutines can vary a lot depending on their parameters.\r\n\r\nFor example there are places where one coroutine is launched for each incoming message. But what those coroutines actually end up doing depends completely on the specific message they are handling. We could not distinguish different messages in that output. There is a decent risk that the high latencies we see are caused by processing messages that come in over the network.\r\n\r\nSo it might help, but it might not be as immensely useful as one could think. Still likely to be the best we can do at this point. I will get to it once I resume work on this issue."
