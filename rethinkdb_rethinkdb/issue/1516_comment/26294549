      "Adding a coro pool on the receiver side for mailbox_manager_t::mailbox_read_coroutine() does not seem to help. The web interface remains responsive, but other operations (such as loading the list of secondary indexes) seem to become even slower. I speculate that this is because they have to go through the same coro pool then.\r\n\r\nPS: Actually my implementation was probably just stupid. I think I limited the number of parallel operations for all mailboxes together, instead of on a per-mailbox level."
