      "@cggaurav We have seen some issues with the reconnection logic lately (tracked in issue https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2755 ). Maybe that's the cause for this (and possibly for some of the other issues you have reported previously as well?).\r\nWe have a patch that we will ship very soon in a new point release (RethinkDB 2.2.5).\r\n\r\nWould you be willing to test a pre-release of 2.2.5 with that patch and see if it works properly for you? I just need to know which distribution+version you are running on your servers, so I can build the right package for you. If you're interested in testing the pre-release binary, please email me at daniel@rethinkdb.com ."
