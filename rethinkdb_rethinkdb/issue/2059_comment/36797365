      "The other application apart from testing is to allow people to temporarily go over the limit. Once they run into the array size limit due to a bad design of their application / schema, that buys them the time necessary to fix their architecture.\r\n\r\nThis assumes that going over the limit happens as part of some intermediate processing step, and not because they're trying to store a huge array into a document (which I agree we should still forbid). The latter sounds like it would be much rarer in practice."
