      "`hdparm -t /dev/sda` reports that it can only read 8 MB/s while RethinkDB is shutting down. Without RethinkDB running the throughput is 124 MB/s on the same disk.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that the disk is actually saturated by the server.\r\n\r\nIf this is indeed the garbage collector:\r\n1. Why does GC seem to have such a random access pattern? (or is inefficient with rotational drives in some other way)\r\n2. Why is garbage collecting not interrupted at shut down? It just seems to keep on going.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting effect is that memory utilization as reported by htop fluctuates significantly during the shutdown process. It varied between about 30% (of 6 GB total on this machine), and up to more than 67%, repeatedly going up and down. I wouldn't expect memory consumption to *increase* (that much) during shutdown."
