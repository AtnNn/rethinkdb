      "@wojons Thanks for chiming in. I did not have any secondary indexes.\r\nThe odd thing is that RethinkDB was actually reading from disk during shutdown. Because this was just a single machine, that couldn't have been due to backfills or cluster operations going on either. As far as I know the only other thing which could cause disk reads during shutdown is our garbage collector. As @coffeemug pointed out, that hypothesis yet has to be verified though.\r\n\r\nI will check later which exact circumstances are required to reproduce it."
