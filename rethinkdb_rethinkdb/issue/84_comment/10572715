      "Well, I think that it's journaled is causing the problem with database corruption on a crash, though I don't know the specifics.  We're supposed to detect this when creating the database file, but apparently there's a bug there (see issue #20).  There's also another issue to remove the requirement that we need direct i/o, issue #47."
