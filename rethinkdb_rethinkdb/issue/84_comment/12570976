      "In this issue, the backtraces show us the problem that some database files, or some hash shards within a database file, are finishing the call to btree_slice_t::create, but are not writing the initial value of the metainfo into the slice.  This results in a superblock with bad metainfo.  The issue #202 reports some other independent problems.\r\n\r\nWe might say that there's a general \"database crashes on file creation\" bug."
