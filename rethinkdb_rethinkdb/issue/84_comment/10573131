      "Hmm, but is the file system in *data* journaling mode or does it just send the meta-data through a journal? The latter doesn't have any problem with RethinkDB (as far as I'm informed, and if it did that would be a really major issue), only the former does because it doesn't work with direct I/O properly. The output of mount would reveal that information.\r\nUsually with \"journaled\" file systems, the journaling is only applied to the meta data. For ext4, data journaling has to be explicitly enabled through the \"data=journal\" mount option. "
