      "Hi @pmieczkowski -- thanks for reporting this.\r\n\r\nI'm having a little bit of trouble reproducing it internally.  How long do you normally have to run the script to cause the error?  Also, do you have some idea of how much RAM+swap the server is using when it goes down?\r\n\r\nOur current architecture uses up a lot of memory per table, and your script creates a lot of them, so one theory I have is that the server is using up all the available memory and then getting shot in the head by the OOM killer.\r\n\r\nObviously this shouldn't result in a corrupted database, though, so this is still a bug even if that's what's happening."
