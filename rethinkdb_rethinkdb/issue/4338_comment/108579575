      "This would be really useful! I think it would be slightly annoying if the sorting function had to be specified on each stream and then again in the \"ordered union\" term. Instead of a new term, perhaps we could just have a boolean optarg to `r.union` for whether or not it should attempt to preserve sorting if all its arguments are ordered streams."
