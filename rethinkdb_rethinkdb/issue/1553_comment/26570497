      "This is fixed and up in code review 986.  This was indeed a problem with being interrupted too early, extproc_job_t was being interrupted right after acquiring a worker, and was not releasing the worker properly.  The worker was put back in the pool, and then rethinkdb would crash the next js job, which would attempt to acquire the same worker."
