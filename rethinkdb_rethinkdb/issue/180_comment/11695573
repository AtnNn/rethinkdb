      "> Basically want we want to do is upon our return to thread A block until we see our changes to the semilattices reflected. The hard way to do it is to specifically check for each query if the changes it would have made have taken effect.\r\n\r\nThat makes total sense. Thanks @jdoliner.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a nice to have, but a must fix. I think it's important to take care of this problem for the following reason:\r\nwhen the user performs cold deploys which runs migrations/seeding scripts, it may randomly fail because of this race.\r\n\r\nThis can also ruin a first impression of rethinkdb. Especially with these scary messages."
