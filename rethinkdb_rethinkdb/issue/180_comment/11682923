      "Ok, so for the sample code in question, there is no bug on our side. You'd get the same issue even for single-node relational systems. Perhaps the only thing we might be able to do here is improve the error message. @jdoliner -- do you see a way to improve the error message here?\r\n\r\nNow for the actual bug, something strange is going on here because this error never shows up on a single connection in our tests. If you're sure the test suite is single threaded and uses one connection, we'll investigate on our side."
