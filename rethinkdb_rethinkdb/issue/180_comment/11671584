      "I'd like to reopen this because I don't think we understand the actual problem here (unless I missed something). The real question is why we ever send \"lost contact with master\" in this specific case. (That is, we typically *do* provide the A part of the CAP theorem in case of a single node, and in case of multiple nodes as well unless there is a netsplit).\r\n\r\n@nviennot -- could you describe more precisely how to reproduce this error message?\r\n\r\n"
