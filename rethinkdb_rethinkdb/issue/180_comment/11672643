      "Does the db actually crash here? The `Unexpected epoll` error is typically just a warning about the client dropping the connection (which happens here because you reconnect in a loop without explicitly closing the connection). What is the behavior of the db and what behavior would you expect?\r\n\r\nAlso, this seems unrelated to the original issue (`lost contact with master`). Does this script also reproduce the original issue?"
