      "Thanks for the feature request @raarts .\r\n\r\nThis was brought up before in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4911 .\r\n\r\nI think an implementation of this would probably end up looking up all the addresses that are configured on the given interface (e.g. `eth0`), and then binding to those.\r\nIf the addresses on `eth0` are later changed, RethinkDB wouldn't automatically pick those changes up until restarted.\r\nWould that be ok for your usage scenario?\r\n\r\nAs a work-around, there's probably some combination of shell commands that you can use to generate the list of IPs automatically and pass them into `rethinkdb`."
