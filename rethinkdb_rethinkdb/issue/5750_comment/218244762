      "That sounds like a fairly specific use case to be honest. I doubt that it makes sense to implement this in the server, as it's a lot more work than just using a script.\r\n\r\nThis line extracts the IP address of a given interface (e.g. eth0):\r\n```\r\nifconfig eth0 | grep \"inet addr\" | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F \":\" '{print $2}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI haven't tested it on an interface without an IP, but it shouldn't be too hard to write a short bash script around this to run this repeatedly until there is an IP, then extract the IP and pass it to `rethinkdb`. Does that work for you?"
