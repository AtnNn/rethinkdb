      "My use case, is that I need to bind to a VPN interface (I use [zerotier](https://www.zerotier.com/), thumbs up for them). IP addresses on those interfaces are managed by the VPN provider. I would like ReDB to check the interface for an IP, emit a warning to the log when nothing is found and wait three seconds before retrying. Multiple ip addresses would not happen in this use case. \r\n\r\nMy alternative would be to frontend RedB with some script that waits for an ip address to be assigned before starting ReDB. Not something I look forward to.\r\n\r\nWhen binding to an interface it would be prudent to re-bind if the ip changes. Some daemons do this (ISC BIND I think, and probably more). This does not happen in my use case, but surely will prevent a few head scratches somewhere.  "
