      "A fix like the one suggested by @mlucy is implemented in branch daniel_4218 and in code review 2879. This leaves the behavior for changefeeds unchanged, but should fix the problem for non-changefeed `getAll`s.\r\n\r\nIn a quick test this reduced the amount of memory used by a `table.getAll(r.args(r.range(0, 8000).coerceTo('ARRAY'))).delete()` from ~3 GB to less than 100 MB and makes the query about twice as fast even on a server with sufficient memory available."
