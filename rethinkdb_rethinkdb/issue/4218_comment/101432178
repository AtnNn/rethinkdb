      "Thanks for opening an issue about this @marshall007 .\r\nWe know that `getAll` with many arguments is inefficient for two reasons:\r\n* it doesn't retrieve the keys in parallel, but one at a time (part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2156)\r\n* the in-memory representation of the arguments has a lot of overhead. Some of that is fixed in our development branch (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2900), but is still the case in 2.0.\r\n\r\nThe fact that your query example is so much slower with a `.delete()` than it is with a `.count()` suggests that there is something else wrong though.\r\nWe have to investigate that."
