      "@danielmewes -- it's possible that `get_all` with ~8k keys is slow because of the recent union changes (i.e. it's trying to do 8k operations in parallel and then union them together and the code is falling over for some reason).  That's the only reason I can imagine that the `forEach` would be faster.  This wouldn't surprise me, the new union infrastructure wasn't written with the 8k case in mind so it might be doing something obviously stupid.\r\n\r\nIf that is the case and you start on a fix, be careful to think about the case where you union 8k changefeeds that never receive a document with 1 changefeed that does (i.e. in the changefeed case we can't just block on a subset of the streams indefinitely)."
