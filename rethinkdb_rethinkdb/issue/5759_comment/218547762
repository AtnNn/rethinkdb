      "Thanks for opening the PR @gergelyke .\r\n\r\nYou can run the JavaScript tests by `test/rql_test/test-runner -i js`. You'll need to compile the RethinkDB server before you do this, or alternatively pass in the location of the `rethinkdb` binary to use through the `-b` parameter.\r\n\r\n@deontologician Could you take a look at @gergelyke 's patch when you have a few minutes?"
