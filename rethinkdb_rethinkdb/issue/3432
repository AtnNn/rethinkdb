        "Attempting to use getNearest(), and it's not returning any results, except if I run a different query first, kinda.\n\nSetup: Table that is structured like so (subset)\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"name\" : \"a business location\",\n    \"address\" : {\n        \"location\": {\n             \"$reql_type$\":  \"GEOMETRY\" ,\n             \"coordinates\": [\n                 -122.730209 ,\n                 48.990702\n              ] ,\n            \"type\":  \"Point\"\n        }\n     }\n}\n```\n\nAs a test, I attempted to run `getNearest()`, taking the location of one of the businesses directly.\n\n``` js\nr.table('locations').getNearest(r.point(-122.730209, 48.990702), { index: 'address.location' })\n```\n\nAnd I get an empty array as a result.\n\nThe other oddity is, if I run this in the query explorer, but run a different query first such as \n\n``` js\nr.table('locations')\n```\n\n_then_ run the previous query, the results show \"[]\" but _also_ \"More data is available. Load the next batch ->\".\n\nClicking that WILL display my 1 returned location which corresponds with the above point.\n\nBut if I run the query again, everything is gone, with no \"More data\" link.\n"
