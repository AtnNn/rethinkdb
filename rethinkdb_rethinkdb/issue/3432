        "Attempting to use getNearest(), and it's not returning any results, except if I run a different query first, kinda.\r\n\r\nSetup: Table that is structured like so (subset)\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"name\" : \"a business location\",\r\n    \"address\" : {\r\n        \"location\": {\r\n             \"$reql_type$\":  \"GEOMETRY\" ,\r\n             \"coordinates\": [\r\n                 -122.730209 ,\r\n                 48.990702\r\n              ] ,\r\n            \"type\":  \"Point\"\r\n        }\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAs a test, I attempted to run `getNearest()`, taking the location of one of the businesses directly.\r\n```js \r\nr.table('locations').getNearest(r.point(-122.730209, 48.990702), { index: 'address.location' })\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I get an empty array as a result.\r\n\r\nThe other oddity is, if I run this in the query explorer, but run a different query first such as \r\n```js\r\nr.table('locations')\r\n```\r\n_then_ run the previous query, the results show \"[]\" but _also_ \"More data is available. Load the next batch ->\".\r\n\r\nClicking that WILL display my 1 returned location which corresponds with the above point.\r\n\r\nBut if I run the query again, everything is gone, with no \"More data\" link."
