      "We can add it as a `Recommended` dependency, so that users who really want a stripped down system aren't forced to install it. I believe apt installs recommended dependencies by default.\r\n\r\nBeware that background processes do not work well with docker. I believe that running `docker run rethinkdb service rethinkdb start` will launch RethinkDB but then immediatly kill it."
