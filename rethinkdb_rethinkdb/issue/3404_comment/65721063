      "`procps` is a required package, part of the Debian base system. The manual says:\r\n\r\n> Removing a required package may cause your system to become totally broken\r\n\r\nIf you want to use RethinkDB on a stripped-down debian system that is missing `procps` you can run `rethinkdb` directly, without using the init script."
