      "This seems somewhat separate from #4628 to me, though #4628 would make supporting this easier.\r\nFrom a functionality point of view, this is very closely related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/544 . In fact https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/544 would make it fairly easy to grep for queries with `r.http` in them and to distinguish between failed and succeeding queries.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be adding an entry to `r.db('rethinkdb').table('stats')` for `r.http`, that could count the number of failures, successes, average request times etc."
