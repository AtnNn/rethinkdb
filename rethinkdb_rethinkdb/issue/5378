I\8217m calling the utility from a script and the output is huge (see attached)\r\nOr rather, the output makes the wrapper script\8217s logs huge.\r\n\r\nnew messages\r\nneilhanlon [5:59 PM] \r\n>/dev/null\r\n?\r\ner...\r\n>/dev/null\r\nredirect stdio to /dev/null\r\n\r\ntennis [6:12 PM] \r\n@neilhanlon: sure, but that leaves me completely blind.  I\8217m thinking of some compromise that will be informative, but not ascii art.\r\n\r\nneilhanlon [6:19 PM] \r\nOnly thing I can think of (besides actually modifying the code) is to pipe it into tr or something to replace the carriage return with a newline\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/_import.py#L601\r\n \r\nGitHub\r\nrethinkdb/rethinkdb\r\nrethinkdb - The open-source database for the realtime web.\r\n\r\ntennis [6:20 PM] \r\nah, ok.  That\8217s a good compromise.  Thanks.\r\n\r\nmglukhov [6:28 PM] \r\n@tennis: could you open an issue describing how you produced that?\r\n\r\n[6:28] \r\nwe can explore options there for how to improve the output, or provide a flag for suppressing it\r\n\r\ntennis [6:29 PM] \r\n@mglukhov: Sure. Np. Thanks for working w/me on that.\r\n```"
