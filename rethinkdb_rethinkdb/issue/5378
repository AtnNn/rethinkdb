I\8217m calling the utility from a script and the output is huge (see attached)\nOr rather, the output makes the wrapper script\8217s logs huge.\n\nnew messages\nneilhanlon [5:59 PM] \n>/dev/null\n?\ner...\n>/dev/null\nredirect stdio to /dev/null\n\ntennis [6:12 PM] \n@neilhanlon: sure, but that leaves me completely blind.  I\8217m thinking of some compromise that will be informative, but not ascii art.\n\nneilhanlon [6:19 PM] \nOnly thing I can think of (besides actually modifying the code) is to pipe it into tr or something to replace the carriage return with a newline\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/_import.py#L601\n\nGitHub\nrethinkdb/rethinkdb\nrethinkdb - The open-source database for the realtime web.\n\ntennis [6:20 PM] \nah, ok.  That\8217s a good compromise.  Thanks.\n\nmglukhov [6:28 PM] \n@tennis: could you open an issue describing how you produced that?\n\n[6:28] \nwe can explore options there for how to improve the output, or provide a flag for suppressing it\n\ntennis [6:29 PM] \n@mglukhov: Sure. Np. Thanks for working w/me on that.\n```\n"
