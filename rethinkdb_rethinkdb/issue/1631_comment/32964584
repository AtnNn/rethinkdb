      "Ok, just verified that my changes fix the disconnection in the web UI.  As an interesting aside, that query is uninterruptible by Ctrl-C, so I'll open a new issue for that.\r\n\r\nI added a new variable to the `ql::env_t`, `evals_since_yield`, which is incremented every time `term_t::eval(...)` is called, and the coroutine will yield and reset the value above a certain threshold (which I set to 256, as that seemed reasonable).  Since each core processing a query has its own `ql::env_t`, each core will handle its yields separately.\r\n\r\nThe changes are up in review 1141."
