      "I timed this solution and did not see a noticeable change in performance.  I imagine the yield overhead is minuscule compared to 256 evals.  Doing this by time instead would be useful for a query where each eval call is very large, but for the majority of cases there would be no change.  In addition, I think it would involve changes to the coroutine layer which would affect performance in other cases.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this should work for now.  Approved and merged into `next` in commit 45a5a01, and will be in release 1.12."
