      "Beyond changing the internal folder name to make it compatible everywhere (generically that sounds good to me), fixing #3755 would also get around this issue completely (even for older `export`s). That way we would never have to have the file on the filesystem at all.\r\n\r\nThe work I am doing on these scripts for #5147 should make this easier (but not make it done)."
