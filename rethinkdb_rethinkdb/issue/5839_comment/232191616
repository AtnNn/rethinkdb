      "This took a little longer than expected to test, as I found a number of issues in supporting both native Python on Windows, and Python running in Cygwin. I think those are all hammered out and in `next` with 9a11580f after review in CR 3689 from branch `larkost/5839-windows-restore`.\r\n\r\nWith these changes in place you can restore `dump`s made on linux using Pyton running on Windows. As an added bonus, if you are sending the data in through `stdin` on linux we now do not write that file onto disk before decompressing it (sadly still to disk)."
