      "Thanks for the issue report @frankdugan3 .\r\n\r\nI'd like to think about this a little.\r\n\r\nI think we could generally change the name of the folder that's inside the archive with RethinkDB 2.4. For 99% of users, this wouldn't break any scripts, because the `.tar.gz` file would still have the same name on Linux and OS X. Just the name of the folder that's packed up inside the archive would be different."
