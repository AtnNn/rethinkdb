        "Make sure denormals are enabled, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Linux kernel should make sure the floating point state stays consistent regardless of task switches.\r\n\r\nWindows has other issues, notably that DirectX graphics calls leave the floating point state in the version they wanted, not the one originally set. We may want to just check the floating point state on a repeating timer, as it's unlikely the libraries we use are bad like that, but if it does happen, we want to at least know it's happening. (It also wouldn't be a bad choice to double-check Linux's floating point settings on a timer too.)"
