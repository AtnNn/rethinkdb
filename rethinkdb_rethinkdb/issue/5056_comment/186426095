      "@nighelles I was able to simplify this a bit by taking advantage of the handy utility functions built into `bluebird`: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/compare/nighelles/5056...marshall007:5056_refactor\r\n\r\nContinuing to support the `return false` behavior from the callback feels dirty and too subtle now that we have the other mechanisms for terminating iteration early. I don't think we should allow you to do that anymore. Also, I thought we were implementing the new behavior on top of `.each()` and deprecating `.eachAsync()`. Is that still the plan?"
