      "@nighelles yep, that looks right. The only clarifications being:\r\n\r\n1. With the promise-style, if a promise is returned from the callback it is awaited before iteration continues (just like if you're using `done` in the callback-style). This is how `eachAsync` works from #4784.\r\n2. Decide on what to resolve in `cursor.each(...).then(...)`. Will we accumulate the results or just resolve with the result from the last iteration? I believe `eachAsync` currently resolves from the last iteration, but this is unspecified behavior."
