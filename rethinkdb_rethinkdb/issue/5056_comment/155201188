      "I'm all for a promise-based API - we currently have our own app-level code wrapping `cursor.each` with a promise ... the breaking change nature of it is something I can't really comment on though.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, in the case of aborting via `cursor.close()`, would that trigger a rejection in the promise-based scenario (i.e., use `catch`)? Or a return value (i.e., `then(function(wasAborted) { ... }))`)?"
