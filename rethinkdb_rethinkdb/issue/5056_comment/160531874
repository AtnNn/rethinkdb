      "Just adding some thoughts here.\r\n\r\n`cursor.close()` returns a promise in rethinkdbdash. The main reason is when that when the driver send a `STOP` query, it does get back a `SUCCESS_SEQUENCE` back, meaning that the server does acknowledge that the cursor is closed.\r\nIt probably require a bit of work in the driver as you may have to keep two callbacks (since you can have a pending `CONTINUE` query and a `STOP` query)\r\n\r\nOn a side note, there's some weird edge cases now when closing a cursor with a pending `CONTINUE` query. More info in this issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash/issues/190"
