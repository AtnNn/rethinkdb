      "@neumino that's a good point, but I'm not sure it's unique to the promise-style. In the callback style, if the user-specified `onFinishedCallback` is called (regardless of whether an error occurred or not) you should be able to assume the `each` callback will not be fired again. It would be very unintuitive if this were not the case.\r\n\r\nI think the solution would be for `each` to capture certain errors and automatically attempt to retry/resume the feed for some period of time before finally failing after some timeout interval or `n` attempts if we can't resume."
