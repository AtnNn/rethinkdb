      "Given the fact that there's sort of two \"interfaces\" for using cursors, it seems like you might need option 2 and option 3 - option 3 for when you're using the `EventEmitter` interface, option 2 for when you're using `cursor.each()`. If there weren't the restrictions on using the `EventEmitter` interface after using other `cursor` methods, I would also lean toward just option 3.\r\n\r\nI do agree that this can be handled purely with application code, and that's what we've done for now. It made things a little more awkward, and means that other code needs to aware of that application-level convention, whereas just wiring up callback listeners directly with the cursor would feel more standard and less brittle."
