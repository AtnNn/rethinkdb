      "I agree this is a problem, but realistically we have to put pixel limits on the amount of text that can be displayed to avoid shuffling around the layouts too much.\r\n\r\nAdding a popover with the full name would be a great solution (as long as it's done tastefully). Something similar to what we do for shards would make sense-- and it would only appear if the name was too long.\r\n\r\nI think we should play around with how it looks and fix this tastefully."
