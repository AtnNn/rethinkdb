        "Opening this issue for discussion\r\n\r\n`upsert` behaves like a `replace` if the document exists. It's confusing because `upsert` is a mix between `update` and `insert`.\r\nIt would probably better to rename the flag `replace`.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we are at it, we may want to provide a flag `update` that would let people insert or update (instead of inserting or replacing).\r\n\r\n\r\nAny thought?\r\nPutting in backlog."
