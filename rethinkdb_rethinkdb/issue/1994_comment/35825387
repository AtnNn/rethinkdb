      "Hi, thanks for reporting this.\r\n\r\nOn the last step (right before you try to click repair button and it does nothing), which screen are you on? I.e. what do you see below the error?\r\n\r\nIn this case the repair button is supposed to jump you to the table/replication settings, but I can see how this can be confusing. We should think through that part of the flow."
