      "@kenny1har -- is the issue you're having with `Manually resolve` button?\r\n\r\n@neumino -- the problem is when you're already on the table page and `Manually resolve` shows up (it happens if the replica count is set on a datacenter, not on the cluster as a whole). In this case clicking the button does nothing. I was under the impression that if you're already on the table page it scrolls the page to the replication settings, but it doesn't.\r\n\r\nIn this case the behavior is indeed very confusing. I wonder if there is a quick fix we can introduce. For example, if the user is already on the table page, we could gray out the `manually resolve` button and have a tooltip that explains what to do."
