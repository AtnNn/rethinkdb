      "@kenny1har -- ok, talked to @neumino, it's a bug we'll solve.\r\n\r\nI agree that resolving issues manually is unwieldy for a large number of tables. I opened an issue for this -- see #2012. Thanks for pointing this out. There will be a programmatic API for this, but the web ui should also be friendly for resolving issues in these cases."
