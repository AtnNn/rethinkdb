      "We sometimes cannot automatically fix the unsatisfiable goal (example below). In this case the button is \"Manually solve\".\r\nClicking on it, takes you to the table page. \r\n\r\nIt's not a good flow because the button behaves like a link. That's something we could improve but\r\n- it's an edge case\r\n- would require a redesign of the resolve issues view -- and I think we should not do it now but for the next version of the web ui.\r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot think of a case with only 2 servers that would end up in a state where the web interface cannot decide where to lower the replicas.\r\nI ran some quick tests and I don't see any unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the button is \"Lower replicas\" and if clicking on it doesn't show a modal where it suggests you to lower the replicas for 2 to 1, then it's a bug.\r\nIn which case, could you tell us what OS/browser you are using? (including the version)\r\nAlso which version of RethinkDB you are using?\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\nExample where the web ui automatically fix the unsatisfiable goal:\r\nTable T requires 2 replica in datacenter D and 1 replicas in the whole cluster\r\nD is the primary datacenter for T\r\n\r\nThere are only two servers in the cluster, M0 and M1 are part of D.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we can fix the unsatisfiable goal by requiring:\r\n- 1 replica in D and 1 replica in the whole cluster\r\n- 2 replicas in D\r\n\r\nSince both solutions are valid, the web interface does not pick one for you, and you have to manually change the replicas."
