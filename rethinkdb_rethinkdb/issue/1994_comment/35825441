      "Ok, just went through the flow.\r\n\r\nAfter I declare the machine dead, I get a \"Lower Replicas\" button. When I click on it, I get a dialog box asking if I want to lower replica count from 2 to 1. When I click ok, my issues get resolved. I'm on `1.11.3`, using Chrome on OS X.\r\n\r\nIs this the behavior you're experiencing? Which version of RethinkDB are you using? Also, what's your OS/web browser?"
