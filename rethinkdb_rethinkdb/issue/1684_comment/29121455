      "@coffeemug -- that query will work, it's only when you're generating keys that it's a problem.\r\n\r\nI think truncating is probably the best solution.  People generally want to get back generated keys for very specific reasons (like they're adding a user and want their ID for an immediate follow-up query), and none of those reasons require getting back more than 100k keys at once.  There are also resource limits to contend with; I'm not sure how well some protobuf implementations will handle 1m or 10m arrays.\r\n\r\nWe should probably also add a field to tell people when this happens."
