      "Thanks @soplakanets. A few quick questions:\r\nAre you using changefeeds, or were you previously using them on the `score` table?\r\nAre there any additional related lines after the \"error: Backtrace\" one in the log file?\r\n\r\nYou say that this was a big delete query. Do you mean that the two keys given to `getAll` were matching a large number of documents?"
