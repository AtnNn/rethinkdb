After that line goes normal startup info \"notice: Running rethinkdb...\"\r\n\r\n> You say that this was a big delete query. Do you mean that the two keys given to getAll were matching a large number of documents?\r\n\r\nYes, that is exactly what I meant. the `getAll()` matched ~350K documents.\r\n\r\n"
