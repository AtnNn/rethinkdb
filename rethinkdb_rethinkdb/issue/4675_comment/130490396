      "@danielmewes I haven't walked through it all again to try and reproduce yet, but here's what I did:\r\n\r\nStarted with a v2.0 data directory which loaded up and told me I needed to recreate the secondary indices. I instead just dropped each database one at a time (without issue). Then started `rethinkdb restore` from a v1.15.0 backup (just contained one database) and killed it early:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rethinkdb restore ./rethink-2015-08-12-04-30.tar.gz\r\nUnzipping archive file...\r\n  Done (43 seconds)\r\nImporting from directory...\r\n[======                                  ]  15% ^C\r\n527967 rows imported in 11 tables\r\nInterrupted\r\nInterrupted\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to drop this database I had just partially restored (via web UI button) it successfully dropped all but one table then the exception occurred."
