      "I don't believe it does.\r\nIf you look at `Connection._data`, it does the following:\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\n# Since we have enough data, we slice it out of the\r\n# buffer, and parse it as JSON.\r\nresponseBuffer = @buffer.slice(12, responseLength + 12)\r\nresponse = JSON.parse(responseBuffer)\r\n\r\n# Now it's off to `_processResponse` where the data is\r\n# converted to a format the user will be able to work\r\n# with, error responses are detected etc.\r\n@_processResponse response, token\r\n```\r\n\r\n`_processResponse` calls `_addResponse` on the right cursor, which in turn calls `_promptNext` which does the prefetching.\r\n\r\nSo `JSON.parse` is done before we start fetching the next batch from what I can tell."
