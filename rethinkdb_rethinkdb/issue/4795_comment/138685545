      "I discussed this with @mlucy in person and he agreed that this behavior should be fine.\r\n\r\nWe only hold onto the information about the cursors in the driver - the server discards it as soon as a terminal response has been sent for a cursor.  It is a little weird that our drivers will send an extra request for a completed cursor (which will always get an error), but that is probably better than holding onto cursors on the server after they've completed so we could send a success response of some kind."
