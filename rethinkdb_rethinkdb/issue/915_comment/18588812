      "After sleeping on it, I think something like `r.args` would be really nice (although possibly with a different name).  Most dynamic languages I can think of have a way to splice a list of arguments into a variadic function.  For example, if you have an object and you wan't to pluck all the fields in an array, you can just write `obj.pluck(r.args(arr))` instead of `arr.map{|x| obj.pluck(:x)}.reduce{|a,b| a.merge(b)}.default({})` (which is even longer in the other client languages)."
