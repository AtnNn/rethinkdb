      "Well, getting that error message back still seems really unfriendly to me. And of course it doesn't work if the dict I pass does happen to actually have a value of \"index\" in it instead then things get really screwy. I also still really dislike the idea of making every driver developer implement this themselves and it also means we've cut off the option of having dicts as primary keys which is something I think we'll want to do once we don't have to worry about key sizes."
