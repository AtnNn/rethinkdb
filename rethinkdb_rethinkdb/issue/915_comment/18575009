      "I think implementing this even without `r.args` would still be useful. I'm not 100% sold on `r.args` doing a side by side comparison we have:\r\n\r\n```Ruby\r\nr([1, 2, 3]).map{|x| tbl.get_all(x, :index => foo)}\r\nr([1, 2, 3]).do(|x| tbl.get_all(r.args(x), :index => foo)}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich isn't clearly better. I'm sure there are some other examples where it might be nicer but it'd be adding a term which I think could quite likely be confusing so I'm not totally sure the pros outweigh the cons."
