      "@mlucy it's hard in Java because you have static typing and no keyword arguments so there's really no way to declare this function. You can do variadic arguments easily. And if you have a non variadic function then you can do keyword arguments as optional arguments which isn't so bad. But as soon as you have both you have to resort to something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"foo\").getAll(\"buzz\", \"bazz\").addOption(\"index\", \"sid\") \r\n```\r\n\r\nI of course don't know Java so no blaming me if some syntax is wrong here. This was what @wmrowan described doing in his driver for YCSB."
