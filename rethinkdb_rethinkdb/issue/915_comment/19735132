      "I really don't think this makes driver developers' lives that much harder; they check the last argument, and if it's a hash then that hash contains the optional arguments for `get_all`.\r\n\r\nI agree that a general rule of not adding optional arguments to variadic functions that take objects is a good idea.\r\n\r\n(As an aside, I don't quite follow your reasoning about Java -- why is this harder in Java than other places where we accept optargs?)\r\n\r\n@coffeemug -- Just for scheduling purposes, how important is it that this issue be in 1.7?  Or be in at all?"
