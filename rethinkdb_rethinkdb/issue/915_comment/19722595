      "@jdoliner -- your third solution is unambiguous in this particular case, because we only allow objects/arrays as primary keys when an optarg is provided to specify the secondary index.  This doesn't actually seem all that hacky to me; if the last argument of the function is a hash we know it's an optarg hash.\r\n\r\nIn cases where there is ambiguity, I agree that we shouldn't do that."
