      "I really dislike the first solution. `get_all_index` implies that `get_all` doesn't work on an index, which it does (it just works on the primary key index). One might argue that it's a matter of naming, but even if we named it `get_all_variadic` (or better), having two functions to do this still seems really messy to me.\r\n\r\nI really like the second solution with a caveat:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntable.getAll('index_foo', ...) // uses index `index_foo`\r\ntable.getAll('id', ...) // uses the primary key (assuming it's named 'id')\r\ntable.getAll(null, ...) // uses the primary key\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems really nice to me. It's less typing than what we have now, it supports variadic arguments nicely, and it seems like a good trade off in these circumstances."
