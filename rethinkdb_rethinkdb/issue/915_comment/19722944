      "@mlucy it's only unambiguous with positive input. A user could think they have a key with a dict value and say something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"foo\").get_all(\"a\", {\"bar\" : \"buzz\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should give an informative error about `{\"bar\" : \"buzz\"}` not being a valid key but instead it will fail silently. This also still puts more burden on driver developers."
