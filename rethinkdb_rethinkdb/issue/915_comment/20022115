      "I've been tasked with adding this to the JS driver which actually provides a good test of how well the query language is documented for 3rd party driver developers since I don't know how these changes were implemented on the server.\r\n\r\nThe type string on the `GET_ALL` term type in the protobuf lists the type as `TABLE, JSON, {index:!STRING}`.  This is the only place that the type `JSON` appears in the spec and I have no idea what it's supposed to mean or how how multiple keys are supposed to be passed to `GET_ALL`.\r\n\r\nBased on the way the Python driver is implemented it looks like this type should be `TABLE, DATUM..., {index!STRING}`. If no one objects, I'll go ahead and change it to this.\r\n\r\nThough these type strings are only comments they serve to document the commands for driver developers. We should remember to keep them up to date, consistent, and clear."
