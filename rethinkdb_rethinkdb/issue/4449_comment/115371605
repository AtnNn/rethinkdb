      "To clarify: If we make the heartbeat timeout configurable, we can have cluster connections survive longer network blips as long as the TCP connection remains alive. I think this will usually be the case if for example someone briefly unplugs a network cable, at least if it's not the one connected directly to the server (so the OS cannot know that the cable has been unplugges).\r\n\r\nThinking about this again, I'm now wondering if this is enough. If for example a router fails somewhere in the network, the TCP connection itself might get terminated. If we want to sustain TCP connection loss, we would need to implement a different timeout parameter (like an actual \"wait this long after losing connectivity before initiating a failover\"). @timmaxw how difficult would it be to have that parameter configurable? Are there any corner cases you can think of that we need to be aware of if this parameter is freely configurable?"
