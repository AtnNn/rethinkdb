      "@mlucy A function pseudo-type seems like a very good idea.\r\n\r\n`deleteWhere` seems unnecessary, it is equivalent to `filter . not`.\r\n\r\n`updateWhere` is a bad name but would be very useful. Perhaps it could be called `mapOn`. It would also be useful to have an indexed version too, related to #2574. I would call it `imapOn`.\r\n\r\nI have also seen many users trying to update a specific index inside an array. Perhaps a shortcut syntax such as `{2: 'foo'}` could replace the third item in the array?"
