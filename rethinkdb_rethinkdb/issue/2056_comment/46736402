      "We can have a singleRowSelection turn into a singleFieldSelection when a field value is selected.  You can use `.delete` or `.replace` on them.  `.update` can work if they're an object.\r\n\r\nSuch an API will also make things straightforward, if/when we support performant updates on individual fields of a row that has other very large fields."
