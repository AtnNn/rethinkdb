      "Hi @ryanaverill, copying the data directory for cloning RethinkDB servers is not supported. From the perspective of the cluster, a cloned node connecting to the cluster looks like a server travelling back in time. This is risky, because it violates a bunch of invariants and guarantees that RethinkDB's clustering layer relies on for its correctness.\r\n\r\nThe recommended way for joining a new server into a cluster is by starting out with an empty data directory.\r\nI recommend moving away (or deleting) the RethinkDB data directory on all but one of your droplets. RethinkDB will create a new data directory together with a new server ID the next time it starts up, and will be able to join the other servers with its new ID."
