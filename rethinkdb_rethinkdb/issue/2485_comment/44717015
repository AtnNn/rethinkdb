      "Here is what happens when I play interactively (with the Python driver, but same effect in others):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Get the changes cursor\r\nr.table('foo').changes().run()\r\n\r\n# Whoops, forgot to save it in a variable\r\nc = r.table('foo').changes().run()\r\n\r\n# Stuck forever... wtf?\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's easy to imagine other pathological examples that would be extremely annoying in interactive use, so I think it's a showstopper for 1.13 (so moving back).\r\n\r\nI agree that it's a duct-tape solution and that we should eventually do something more robust, but for now this seems necessary."
