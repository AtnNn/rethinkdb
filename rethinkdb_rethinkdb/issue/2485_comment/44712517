      "> We could change to have changefeeds always send back an empty SUCCESS_FEED batch after a timeout the way we do on the first batch.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a sensible behavior to implement on the server-side, but what would that mean for the drivers? Presumably when the driver sees an empty `SUCCESS_FEED` they'd have to automagically send another `CONTINUE` to the server to make sure the user doesn't have to restart the feed (which would be bad). But then, other things might happen on that connection in the JS driver (and eventually other drivers when they become thread safe) and the driver would have to figure out how to order them.\r\n\r\nWould you automagically get sensible ordering in the JS driver now? Would Python and Ruby drivers continue already send `CONTINUE` or would we have to change them?"
