      "It seems like everyone's on board with this; I'm going to make changefeeds time out even after the first batch.\r\n\r\n@srh -- right now the changefeeds are timing out using the undocumented `max_dur` option in the batchspec (there's an issue somewhere for documenting those and exposing them to users).  The only difference form a normal stream is that the normal stream waits for at least one row after the timeout, and changefeeds will return an empty batch after the timeout instead."
