      "In general, if you send two queries on the same connection, we will always process them in order.  If you send a CONTINUE query for the changefeed, nothing else on the connection will be processed until there's a change.\r\n\r\nWe could change to have changefeeds always send back an empty SUCCESS_FEED batch after a timeout the way we do on the first batch, or we could just close this.  @coffeemug, do you have an opinion?"
