      "> Assuming that by \"not' you mean \"still\", I thought that if the server sends an empty success on a timeout, it would then be able to respond with the messages for the other token. Is that not so?\r\n\r\nI meant 'not'.  There, you're not stuck forever, because the server returns the cursor after a timeout, because in the example you posted, it's ~~not~~ the first batch.\r\n\r\nHowever I can see how when requesting future batches we might want also to have a timeout by default.  And (eventually) an option to specify the timeout (or no timeout)."
