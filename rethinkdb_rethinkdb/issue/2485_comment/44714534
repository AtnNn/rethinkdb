      "Sending an empty response after a timeout is not a solution to this problem.  It just means other queries have a mysterious timeout.  Or, if the timeout is low, it also means that a huge amount of traffic will involve clients and servers chattering away without sending any information.  Users aren't going to want to architect their application so that their queries get all these 500 ms timeouts anyway -- the answer, even if you have a timeout for this reason, is still to have change feeds run on their own connection.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why the server needs to send its responses in the order that they're received.  If you want to support running change feeds on the same connection as other queries, it should just accept and respond to other queries while it processes a change feed query.\r\n"
