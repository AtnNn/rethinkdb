      "Could you rephrase the question?  I sort of don't follow.  Each stream has a token associated with it that's included in all the messages between the client and the server.  So other things happening on that connection with different tokens shouldn't interfere.\r\n\r\nBasically, if the clients respond to an empty SUCCESS_FEED the same way they respond to a SUCCESS_FEED with data, everything should work fine."
