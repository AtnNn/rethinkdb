        "I connected two clusters of 5 machines each. Now all 10 machines know about each other and there are many conflicting database and table names. Worst of all, it is impossible to undo. I imagine that it would be very troublesome to fix if it ever happened by accident to one of our users in production.\n\nI think it should be impossible to connect clusters together like that. We could implement a cookie system like in Erlang, [described here](http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html). Or maybe require that if the blueprints are too different users must pass a new `--force-join` flag to join instances together.\n\nTagging as pr:high and moving to subsequent.\n"
