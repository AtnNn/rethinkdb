      "@larkost - I actually added this to the ruby and python drivers for `polyglot/regression/3758.yaml` - it's expressed as:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n    testopts:\r\n        noreply_wait: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI didn't end up implementing it for the JS driver because it looked like it would get really complicated (and I was just looking to test server behavior, not client behavior)."
