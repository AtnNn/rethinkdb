        "@neumino and @danielmewes believe that we should always return arrays to the user by default, and only return cursors if the user asks for them via an optarg. This issue is to discuss this potential change.\r\n\r\n(I'd like to delay the discussion until we ship 1.14, though -- there is already a lot of communication we have to do and I don't want this to slow down the release even further; if possible, please refrain from discussing this until it gets scheduled.)"
