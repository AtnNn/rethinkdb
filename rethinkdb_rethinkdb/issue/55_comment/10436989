      "None of these compilation errors happen for me on the latest 64-bit debian stable.  Are you running testing or unstable?\r\n\r\nBoth size and endsz are declared as `ssize_t` in that function, so it doesn't make sense that the compiler would call one of them a `ssize_t` and the other an `int`.  It's almost plausible if `sizeof(int) == sizeof(ssize_t)` -- either `sizeof(int) == 8` for some reason or your compiler is targeting a 32-bit architecture."
