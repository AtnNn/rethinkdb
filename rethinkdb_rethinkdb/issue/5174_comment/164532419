      "@DenJohX We will build the repo with the fix for the next update (RethinkDB 2.2.2), independently of whether the patch gets merged upstream or not.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that this only applies if you're running an unstable distribution or manually install the new apt version. Is that correct? Or does this affect any supported distributions?\r\nWe could rebuild the repositories before the next release if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime you can of course work around this by downloading the package directly from https://download.rethinkdb.com/apt/pool/ ."
