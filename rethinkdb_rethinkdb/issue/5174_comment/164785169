      "Agreed, when I reported it, apt-1.1 was in experimental so needed to be manually installed. It has since moved to sid (unstable) and stretch (testing). While stretch is not a release, I actually don't know anyone using Debian for daily work (as opposed to servers) and not using testing..\r\n\r\nSo.. 2.2.2 is probably fine, assuming it goes out after new years and not after easter."
