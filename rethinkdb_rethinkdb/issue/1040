        "We currently have a very confusing behavior if people try to use mutliple comparison syntax in python. Observe:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n>>> r.expr(1).do(lambda x: 0 < x < 2)\r\n<RqlQuery instance: r.expr(1).do(lambda var_3: (var_3 < 2)) >\r\n```\r\n\r\nbasically we just drop the first comparison. This is because `0 < x < 2` is desgured to `0 < x and x < 2` by python and python then python evaluates `a and b` to `b` if it considers both `a` and `b` to be true.\r\n\r\nI'm actually not sure we can do anything here. But I'm curious to see if anyone else has an idea. At the very least we should document this."
