        "I talked to @jdoliner about this issue on IRC yesterday. But, I thought it would be worth my time to create an issue regarding the problem.\r\n\r\nI have a large table ~30,000 documents, each document is ~150K and when I run a straightforward count query \r\n\r\n``` r.table('mytable').count().run(conn) ```\r\n\r\nit either takes a long time to complete or errors out.\r\n\r\nEvidence:\r\n\r\nhttp://snapnote.io/0o4zZT\r\nhttp://snapnote.io/dw3pRh\r\n\r\nIn my mind this a major issue and should be addressed before RethinkDB is production ready. Thoughts?"
