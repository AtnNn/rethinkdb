      "I'm going to bump this and add that it is still running slowly on macOS Sierra. I ran a similar test to @ha1331, but with updates instead of inserts, and the results were the same - roughly 40 writes/s on a 5 year old Macbook Pro. \r\n\r\nWorth noting is that when I did the same test with a docker container running on the same computer, I got between 500 and 700 writes/s."
