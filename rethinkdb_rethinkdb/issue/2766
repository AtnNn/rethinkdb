        "Currently you can write `r.now['epoch_time']` to get the `epoch_time` field out of a ReQL type.  I think this is a bug (or at least it wasn't in the original spec).  It's also bad because it makes it hard for us to later replace \"real\" pseudotypes with \"fake\" pseudotypes like `r.binary` that don't actually store themselves as their pseudotype representation.  It also locks us into a representation.\n\nWe should stop doing that.  (Note that this might break people's queries.)\n"
