      "A third problem: After reloading the page, a secondary index that's in the \"Building\" stage is now shown as being in the \"Started\" stage. I'm not sure if we can currently distinguish between them from the `indexStatus` output. There's two things we could do:\r\n1. expand `indexStatus()`, this is probably the better solution\r\n2. make the web UI assume that an index is in the 'building' stage if the index already exists when loading the page. If an index appears later it's probably fair to assume it's in the `started` stage at first.\r\n\r\nI think this might have been broken by changes done for the `jobs` table, since I believe indexes in the building stage weren't previously reporting the `blocks_processed`/`blocks_total` fields in `indexStatus()`, but now they do.\r\n\r\nEdit: See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3726"
