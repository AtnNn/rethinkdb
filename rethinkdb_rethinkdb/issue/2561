        "Specifically, as a Ruby user, it's easy to end down a bit of a rabbit hole when following data migration instructions. 'rethinkdb dump' fails because I don't have the Python driver installed. Okay, fair enough. I follow the [instructions to install the Python driver through pip](http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/python/). \n\nHowever, since I'm trying to migrate to a newly released version of rethinkdb, I inadvertently install the incorrect version of the Python driver. I have to then uninstall the Python driver, find the appropriate previous version in pip, then reinstall it. In my case:\n\n```\nsudo pip install rethinkdb==1.12.0-2\n```\n\nIt all works fine in the end, but it seems rather roundabout. At the very least, I think the documentation could be updated to state these steps explicitly. I assume they're written from the perspective of someone running the Python driver, which obviously isn't always the case.\n"
