      "Hi Ralph,\r\n\r\nSometimes new features and bugfixes break backward compatibility with old indexes, and those indexes have to be upgraded.  Since it isn't always convenient for users to do this right at release, we usually support older un-upgraded indexes for a few versions.  In 2.1 we dropped support for indexes created with RethinkDB 1.3, so those indexes won't work any more until they're upgraded.\r\n\r\nIf you re-install RethinkDB 2.0 and open up the web UI, there should be an issue saying something like \"this index needs to be upgraded\" with a button you can press.  If you upgrade that index and then re-install 2.1, everything should work."
