      "@bfqrst Note that due to an oversight on our end, additional steps in addition to what @mlucy said might be necessary if you have old tables without any indexes.\r\n\r\nIf you have previously been on 2.0.x and it didn't show any warnings about indexes needing to be upgraded, you might need to perform one of the following steps (either works):\r\n\r\n1. For each table that does not have any secondary indexes, create a new index and then delete it again. The index does not need to make sense (it can be on a non-existing field), and you do not need to wait for it to complete construction. It's enough to create and immediately delete it again.\r\n\r\n2. Wait until we release RethinkDB 2.0.5. This should happen in the next days. Then install RethinkDB 2.0.5 and start it once. That will make sure that all tables without indexes are made compatible with 2.1.x. You can then upgrade back to 2.1.2 and it should start fine."
