      "@danielmewes Thanks Daniel, installing 2.0.4 an creating a bunch of bogus secondary indexes for each table worked like a charm. After brew installing 2.1.2 I'm back in business. @mlucy As Daniel assumed, there was no complaining about \"this index needs to be upgraded\"... Anyway, it's working again!\r\n\r\nThanks for the workaround guys. Case closed.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nRalph"
