      "@jdoliner -- please maintain the issue etiquette. Use friendly tone, be helpful to others, make a reasonable attempt to explain your thinking, and don't unilaterally close issues that have other participants.\r\n\r\nThe field `parallel_tasks` implies an array of tasks that have been executed in parallel. Could you explain why it makes sense for it to be an array of arrays of objects rather than an array of objects? What is an example situation where the double-array structure is actually used and what does it mean?"
