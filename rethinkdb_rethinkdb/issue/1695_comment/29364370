      "Think of it this way: a profile represents a thread of execution, a profile is an array of events. One of the possible events is a split in which several threads of execution happening in parallel. This is represented as an array of profiles (one for each thread of parallel execution). If it was just an array of events then how would you know where one parallel thread of execution ended and another began?"
