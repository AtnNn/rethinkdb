      "Sorry if you thought it was just a question. It was more a bug report or a request to change the format of the profiler.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am expecting to get an array of tasks in `parallel_tasks`. Now we have an array of tasks, which is like having a task without description and the wrong format..\r\nWhat I was expecting is\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    description:...\r\n    parallel_tasks: [\r\n        {\r\n            description:\r\n            sub_tasks: [ ... ]\r\n        },\r\n        { ... }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of \r\n```\r\n{\r\n    description:...\r\n    parallel_tasks: [\r\n        [ ... ],\r\n        [ ... ]\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```"
