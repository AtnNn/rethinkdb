      "@neumino: i'm not sure what for \"Server name\" is here. Normally it's hostname of server that hosts database, but here it's impossible to use it like that, because I can't enter dot character, so i can't enter FQDN.\r\nCould you explain purpose od \"Server name\" and \"Datacenter [name]\"?\r\n\r\nRethink has good API, but not big docs imo. Good that at least there's something ;P"
