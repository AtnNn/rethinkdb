      "I believe the reason we don't allow \"-\" characters is so that `name` and `uuid` are unambiguous (this is more of an issue for the command-line admin interface).  If we want to allow \"-\" characters, we would also have to ensure that names cannot be confused with a uuid.  It's not a huge problem to implement, but there are several interfaces through which names can be set and we need to make sure we cover them all."
