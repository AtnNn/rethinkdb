      "@morsik each RethinkDB instance has a uuid. The name is just a way to refer in a more friendly way to a machine.\r\nInstead of settings replicas/acks in a datacenter with a uuid, you set replicas/acks in a datacenter with a name.\r\n\r\nThe same for a machine.\r\n\r\nAbout the docs, I completely agree. I recently took over the docs, and have been working on to make them better.\r\nThe first pass should be pushed on the website around next week.\r\n\r\nI'll also make sure to add some docs about what the names for datacenter/server are for."
