      "Hi @morsik -- we made the decision early on to be compatible with what essentially is a C identifier (alphanumeric characters, plus underscores). Enforcing this consistently saved us quite a bit of pain. I realize that this makes naming servers somewhat complicated because you can't make server names equivalent to hostnames.\r\n\r\nWe'll debate this internally and see what we come up with. In the meantime, one solution to this would be to replace dots in hostnames with underscores (not ideal, but should work in the interim). I'm moving to backlog for now as it won't make it into 1.6, but we'll reopen it as soon as we work through some of the lower hanging fruit."
