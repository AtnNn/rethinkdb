      "If the data fits into RethinkDB's cache, and there's no other bottleneck (network, speed at which the client is reading the data), CPU usage should ideally get as high as 100% when running an operation like this. Anything less just means that CPU resources are left unutilized.\r\nSo 30% (or more) are definitely normal."
