      "In case you didn't know, rethinkdb has pretty vibrant community at slack http://slack.rethinkdb.com/ at irc, freenode #rethinkdb and a mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rethinkdb. You might get better answers there and also answering further questions might be easier.\r\n\r\nas to your question, I suspect it's perfectly normal. Based on the information you provided, it's pretty hard to say anything definitive. Having database in separate machine should be a thing to consider with any database, not only with Rethinkdb. "
