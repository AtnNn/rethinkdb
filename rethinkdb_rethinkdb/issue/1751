        "I intermittently observed the following behavior:\r\nIn a cluster of 64 nodes, I had three tables. The first two had 32 shards each, with about 1000 small documents per table.\r\n\r\nThen I resharded table 3 to 32 shards.\r\n\r\nWhile table 3 was resharding, table 1 became unavailable for queries (\"no master available\"). Looking at table 1 on the web UI, I could see that only 31/32 shards were available. Once table 3 was done resharding, table 1 also came back up.\r\n\r\nI think this might be related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1667, where modifications to one table also impacted the availability of others.\r\n\r\nThis was in my branch daniel_realtime_message_hub with a few additional modifications, but I think the chances are high that this is an issue in next as well."
