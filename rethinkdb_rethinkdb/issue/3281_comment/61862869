      "> Switching to rethinkdb-x-y-z makes more sense since the format doesn't break for minor releases .\r\n\r\nI think that would be ok too.\r\nOur API *does* regularly break for minor releases though, so I think it wouldn't be formally correct.\r\nDoes the semver definition of the different version numbers have any actual consequences on npm's behavior?"
