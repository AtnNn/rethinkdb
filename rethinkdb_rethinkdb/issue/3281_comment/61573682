      "Looking at http://semver.org/ , it actually sounds like we should combine the x and y (e.g. 1 and 14) into the major version \r\n> Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards incompatible changes are introduced to the public API.\r\n\r\nIf we update from 1.14.0 to 1.15.0, we sometimes do introduce backwards incompatible changes. The z we used to have in `rethinkdb-x.y.0-z` on the other hand sounds like it would match the patch version Z in the semver version `X.Y.Z`.\r\n\r\nThis would of course mean somewhat decoupling the driver version from the server version, though it seems like we need to do that in any case.\r\n\r\nHow about we turn \"1.14.0-1\" into \"114.0.1\"?\r\nRethinkDB \"2.0.x\" would get the driver version \"200.0.0\"."
