      "This is very similar to the issue in #4600, so I am duping this against that. The only difference is that this is probably in the part where we are figuring out the hostname of the computer we are running against. Unfortunately the solution is going to be the same one as that one (hence the dup), which is to put a timer on our network setup, and then just report if it fails to work in a timely fashion. So you would at least have a logged line telling you that things were slow."
