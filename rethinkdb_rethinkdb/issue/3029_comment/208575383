      "Any update on this? It's been a year now... \r\n\r\nReason I'm here, I have three containers running rethink, and they are very creatively named rethinkdb-1, -2, -3 etc, but they all three have _s4j appended to them. I was just wondering where _this_ came from? I can understand a random hostname if there is a conflict or if there is none supplied, but in this case the hostnames were all unique but the suffix isn't unique!\r\n\r\nI now have rethinkdb_1_s4j, rethinkdb_2_s4j, rethinkdb_3_s4j :disappointed: "
