      "> how often do people have multiple computers with the same hostname?\r\n\r\nA place I've previously worked at had naming conventions that went like `<purpose><ordinal>.<datacenter>.blahblahblah`.  So you'd have about twenty machines whose shortname was always `dns1`, because it was named `dns1.sjc` or `dns1.jfk` or whatever.  I dunno why you would put them all into a cluster, but we routinely had names like that."
