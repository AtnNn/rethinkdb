      "I used to do the opposite when we had randomly generated named: I would go through each server and rename it to its hostname. That probably depends on the environment that you are running in, and some cloud environments might not have the same properties as you point out.\r\n\r\nThe main problem I always had when server names didn't include host names was actually that I couldn't find out which name was for which physical (or virtual, doesn't matter) server. I would have to connect to each one's web UI to check the \"connected to\" line to figure out the mapping. Showing the hostname in the web UI in some nice place would solve this part.\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky In the case of AWS, doesn't the EC2 management console also show servers by hostname?\r\nIf a RethinkDB server goes down and I'm connected to the web UI (through another server), I get a message similar to `Server <server name> not available`. If I can immediately map that to the corresponding node in the EC2 console (e.g. for restarting it) that's a big advantage I think."
