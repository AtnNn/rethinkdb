      "How often do people run multiple RethinkDB instances with the same hostname? I figure it's rare for people to run multiple instances on the same server, but how often do people have multiple computers with the same hostname? I'm trying to get a sense of how big a name set we need to avoid name collisions.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to generate names of the form `newton-gamma-238`, to reduce the probability of collisions."
