      "Thinking about this again I think having the host name first is definitely better.\r\n\r\n\"hostname_adjective\" doesn't read as nicely as \"adjective_hostname\", but there's a certain arrogance in assuming that our own random naming scheme is somehow *more* relevant than whatever people currently use to assign host names.\r\nSure, sometimes (e.g. in the case of EC2) the host names will be more or less random. But in other cases people actually put some thought into them and putting our adjective first would kind of mess with that."
