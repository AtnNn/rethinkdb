      "Hmm, I personally think hostnames as server names are awesome. In my use cases that has made dealing with servers way easier.\r\nYou're right though about many cases of cloud deployments. However even then I think using the hostname is better than using a random name. Even though it doesn't look pretty, you can at least still identify which RethinkDB server corresponds to which (virtualized) node. (do Docker instances get individual names assigned btw.?)\r\n\r\nMay I ask in which use case you are typing out the server names?\r\n\r\nDisplaying the actual hostname of the machine in a prominent place in the web UI would work. But it would also mean that there would then be two ways to identify a server in the UI, which is probably just confusing."
