      "> on OS X, my laptop name is batgirl but RethinkDB adopts the name batgirl_local. Where is that coming from?\r\n\r\nPresumably, you laptop's fully qualified name is actually `batgirl.local`. We probably only want to use the first part of the domain name, and should check if we can tweak the way we retrieve the hostname on OS X to avoid using the full domain."
