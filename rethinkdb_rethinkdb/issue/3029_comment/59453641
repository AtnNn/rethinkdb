      "@danielmewes, here's what I see in EC2:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2014-10-16 at 5 40 49 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/91193/4672847/4835bcc0-5597-11e4-9b5e-d7be723e9c2a.png)\r\n\r\nThe hostname of this machine (after sshing into it) is `ip-172-31-32-236`, which is taken from the IP of the instance. You'll notice the name `ganymede` -- I named my instance in the management console (it was blank by default), and named my RethinkDB node the same in the web UI.\r\n\r\nBasically, the hostname is the same as the IP address, so it's not terribly useful (and difficult to distinguish in a long list of names that are a jumble of characters).\r\n\r\n@mlucy suggested moving the friendly descriptor to the front of the server name, e.g. `<friendly word>-<hostname>`, which I think is reasonable."
