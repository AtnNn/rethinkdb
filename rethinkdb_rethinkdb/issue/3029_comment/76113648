      "If we want the words to be neutral greek letters seem like a great option.\r\n\r\nThe word lists @deontologician suggested from namingschemes.com aren't quite as neutral (some less so than others), and some of them have somewhat difficult and/or lengthy words.\r\n\r\nI think I like either greek letters or colors better.\r\nI personally don't think `newton_red` would be a big issue. That being said as @deontologician pointed out there aren't that many simple colors, so greek letters would be a better choice anyway to avoid name conflicts.\r\nWe could also use greek colors ;-)\r\n"
