      "I'm increasingly beginning to think that using hostnames for server names isn't useful:\r\n\r\n- when you're deploying on AWS / cloud deployments, you're less attached to the hostname psychologically\r\n- if you're running multiple nodes on one physical machine (or a set of Docker instances, or VMs), it's even less useful, and it's hard to tell the server names apart.\r\n- if the goal is to have the RethinkDB server name identify the specific server, having some combination of attributes of the server be the hostname doesn't help much -- you still have to type out some weird jumble of underscores and adapter names.\r\n- we could add hostname / adapter names to the web UI and the admin APIso you can still identify which physical machine it's on.\r\n\r\nI'm a strong proponent of @deontologician's suggestion in #3916 -- pick a random interesting word or words (e.g. \"cappucino\", \"russian-mocha\" or \"chess-student\"), which would keep things friendy but identifiable.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked the ReQL admin API for servers yet for whether it includes the hostname, but that seems like a better way to expose that info."
