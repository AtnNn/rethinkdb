      "I think it's reasonable to design this for up to 4 servers being run with the same hostname.  Our old set was about 100 names, and if someone ran 4 servers on the same host, we would have had about a 5% chance of collision.\r\n\r\nHere's a handy chart:\r\n![The Birthday Paradox](http://i.imgur.com/GBT5aSI.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, if we want a collision chance of less than 10%, we would need at least 60 names."
