      "I would be ok with `<hostname>_<happy_adjective>` since it is actually pretty important to have the hostname first (even though it makes more sense to be `<happy_adjective>_<hostname>` when you read it out loud).\r\n\r\nI think we should limit the length of the adjective to ten characters, combine and deduplicate a few lists of positive adjectives, and remove ones that we don't like in review (happy to do this). Glad to see this going into 2.0!"
