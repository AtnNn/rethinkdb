      "I'd have to look into how Docker does hostnames. \r\n\r\nCurrently we don't type server names often (but I do see them in the web UI). When deploying to the cloud, I didn't want to see a jumble of characters that were meaningless to me, so I renamed each node manually using my own naming scheme via the web UI -- which took time and was tedious.\r\n\r\nWhen we add the ReQL admin API, we will definitely be typing server names more often. The problem with using hostnames as the server name comes down to two things that have changed in how developers work:\r\n  - the cloud detaches you from a physical box, so people don't necessarily use the hostname to uniquely identify each node in their minds (and you can move from physical machine to machine).\r\n  - people can run more than one node on the same physical machine, and the hostname is a vestige of that physical box -- this is why we include the adapter name, etc. + a random string.\r\n\r\nI could be wrong in this (please voice an opinion if you feel otherwise), but I think there are better ways (as @danielmewes suggested) to still show the hostname to the user.\r\n\r\n"
