      "@mglukhovsky You seemed to have strong opinions about this issue. What do you think about appending an adjective to the end of the hostname , like \"newton_yellow\"?\r\n(*Edit*: oh I see that actually was your original proposal in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3029#issue-42465990 . So do you still like that scheme?)\r\n\r\nAlso: Do we agree that colors are a good choice for what to append? (I think they are)"
