      "You could also do it with `get` like this if you wanted to:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.expr([r.table('marvel').get('thor')]).eqJoin('weapon', r.table('mythical_weapons'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that `eqJoin` works on sequences (not on individual documents), which `getAll` returns.\r\n\r\nArguably, we should allow running joins on a single document as well."
