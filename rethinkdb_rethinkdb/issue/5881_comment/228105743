      "Putting a `console.log` into a ReQL function won't work like you expect. The log statement won't run on the server, just once when the function is serialized before it's sent to the db. What happens is `console.log(x)` gets evaluated and returns `undefined`, then your function becomes \"takes any document and always returns undefined\", and then the filter is run with that. So it looks like you're just using a javascript function, but really it can't run any javascript, it has to return a reql expression.\r\n\r\nA good way to test if your filter is working correctly, is to turn it into a `.map`, run it to see what's going on and if it's doing what you expect, and then turn it back into a `.filter`"
