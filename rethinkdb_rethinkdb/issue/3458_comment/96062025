      "@ravi a few questions: when you say\r\n> Did the export from the 1.11.x server using the 2.0.0-1 binary\r\n\r\ndo you mean that you ran `rethinkdb export` after updating the server binary to 2.0? I think that shouldn't matter, since the `rethinkdb` binary is really just a thing wrapper around the underlying `rethinkdb-export` Python script.\r\n\r\nAfter you had exported the data, did you update the RethinkDB Python driver?\r\nThe actual import logic comes with the Python driver, so you might have to update that before importing into the new server:\r\n`$ sudo pip install --upgrade rethinkdb`\r\n\r\nLet me know if that works."
