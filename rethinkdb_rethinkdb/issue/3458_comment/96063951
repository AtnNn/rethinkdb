      "@danielmewes Thank you for the response. Yes on the first: I ran rethinkdb after updating the server binary to 2.0. You know this stuff infinitely better than me but I am puzzled to learn that the `rethinkdb` binary, which is the same one used to run the actual server, is a thin wrapper. I am guessing I have misunderstood your message possibly.\r\n\r\nOne important point missing from my earlier message: my older version of RethinkDB (1.11.x) was installed using `apt-get` while the new one (2.0.0-1) was built by me from source.\r\n\r\nRegarding the second, I did not explicitly update the driver, so I am guessing it must be the old driver. If I were to upgrade the driver as suggested, will my earlier (1.11.x) DB be impacted? I cannot, unfortunately, afford that."
