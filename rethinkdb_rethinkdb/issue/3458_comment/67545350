      "Hi @danielmewes \r\nI had defaulted all files as utf8 (initial import into rDB)\r\nAs part of the process, I derived the JSON from an fs.WriteFile() off of a scripted eqJoin() on two rethinkDB tables.\r\nPerhaps, fs is causing the issue-- since the data are fully functional in tables prior to eqJoin()?\r\n\r\nBTW, luv the product.\r\n"
