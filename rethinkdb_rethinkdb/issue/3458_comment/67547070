      "Thanks for the info. It would be really weird if `eqJoin()` caused the data to become corrupted. Not sure about `fs`.\r\n\r\nCan you send us the JSON data file you're importing, so we can reproduce the issue locally? We can sign an NDA if it contains sensitive data.\r\nIf it's small enough after compression, you can just send it in an email to daniel at rethinkdb.com. Otherwise, we can set up a server for you so you can upload the file securely."
