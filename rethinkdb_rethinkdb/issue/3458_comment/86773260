      "Hi Daniel,\nIt was a UTF8 issue derived from source-- which, in this instance was oracle. We resolved issue at source and now import to rDB is fully functional. \nI can test with UTF8 errors if that would help to resolve.\n\nThanks\n\nX10BA\n\n\n> On Mar 26, 2015, at 3:34 PM, Daniel Mewes <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> @x10ba any updates?\n> \n> \8212\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n> \n"
