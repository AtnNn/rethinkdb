      "Hi @x10ba, do you have a way to check that all strings in your data are valid UTF-8?\r\nWe've seen `import` break before if the data contains illegal characters. Fixing those parts of the data is probably going to make the import work.\r\n\r\nI think @Tryneus you've already added better handling of this problem for our next release? Is there a way for @x10ba to find out which document is causing this?"
