      "Hi\nWe isolated to Brazil, Poland and Japan, but affected any special or accented char. \nFor example, oracle was writing S\227o Paulo as S\128542o Paulo to the tables-- we inherited the oracle db so it took a bit to figure out. I'd normally script the fix, but at scale better to setup source correctly, and tested import to rDB without error.\n\nOn phone so smiley face is placeholder for the blocked symbol and my grammar is suspect.\n\nDoes that help?\nX10BA\n\n\n> On Mar 26, 2015, at 5:46 PM, Daniel Mewes <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> @x10ba Thanks for the update! Happy to hear it's now working.\n> If it's no trouble for you, it would be interesting for us to know the sort of encoding that causes the issue so we can test for it. If it's effort for you to get that data back don't worry though.\n> \n> \8212\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n> \n"
