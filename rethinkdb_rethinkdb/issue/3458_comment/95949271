      "I have a similar issue. Trying to upgrade my server from 1.11.x to 2.0.0-1. Did the export from the 1.11.x server using the 2.0.0-1 binary. Maybe that was wrong but it seems to have worked! When I try to run the import to 2.0.0-1 (using the 2.0.0-1 binary) it proceeds to 2% but hangs at that point, for hours (10+ hours in my last run). The DB and tables are created but no data is imported. My DB has three tables, only one of which has records, about ~60k. The total size of data is in the order of tens of MBs.\r\n\r\nCommand:\r\n\r\n````\r\n./bin/rethinkdb import -c 127.0.0.1:28016 -a ...... --format json -d /tmp/collectiondb\r\n````\r\n\r\nI just tried again using `--clients 1` and that seems to make things worse: it now hangs at 0% though once again the DB and tables seem to be created.\r\n"
