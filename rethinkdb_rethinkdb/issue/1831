        "@wojons has a cluster with the following interesting phenomenon:\r\n\r\nA table with 1 shard, 2 replicas. ~2M documents. 2 secondary indexes.\r\nOn disk, the table takes 6.8 GB on the secondary, but 17 GB on the primary. Both primary and secondary had previously backfilled the complete table from a third node, and there have been no writes to the table since.\r\n\r\nSo somehow the same table takes a lot more space on the primary. We should investigate how that can happen.\r\n\r\n@wojons mentioned some (OOM) crashes during the backfilling process, wonder if that might be related."
