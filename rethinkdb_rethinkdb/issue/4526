        "On two computers, on current `next` I am getting a failure one two of the subtests in `connections/connection.js`, specifically:\r\n- `connection close does not wait if we want it not to`\r\n- `connection reconnect does not wait if we want it not to`\r\n\r\nThe subtests time out, indicating that the post-call function is not being called. I disabled the setting of `BLUEBIRD_DEBUG` so this is probably not a repeat of #4496, but it could well be related to the recent update to `bluebird`.\r\n\r\nI have a [smaller test](https://gist.github.com/larkost/99c526c1d171caa4096e) that demonstrates this, as well as an improved version of the test that adds more stable versions of these tests as well as new versions that demonstrate this:\r\n- `connection close noreplyWait works even with outstanding noreplyWait calls`\r\n- `connection reconnect noreplyWait works even with outstanding noreplyWait calls`\r\n\r\nSo far this only reproduces on my two computers (home and work), and only on `next` (so not `2.0.4`). Isolating the problem I found that it only occurs in `mocha` tests where the tests is inside (at least) two levels of `describe`. This leads me to believe that this is a very narrow timing issue, and is probably going to be really nasty to debug. I do think that this is a valid problem and could reach out and bite someone."
