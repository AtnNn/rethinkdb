      "> Does that one replica know to send the row to all the other replicas when it comes up?\r\n\r\nYes.  The other replicas are out of date and need to get caught up.\r\n\r\n> Also, why do up-to-date reads have to go to one machine rather than going to any replica if all the replicas are equal?\r\n\r\nIt's easy to keep them ordered with writes if you send them to the machine that orders all the writes."
