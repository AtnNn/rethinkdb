      "Hooray!  Except one thing:\r\n\r\n`cursor = r.table('users').onChange(since=timestamp).run(conn)`\r\n\r\nAlso: we *could* make sure we have accurate per-row logical timestamps, and then expose regions and logical timestamps to the user.  If you exposed logical timestamps and shards and let the user say, \"Get me the changes on shard X since timestamp T...\"\r\n\r\nThat would let users \"catch up\" after missing changes during a disconnection.\r\n\r\nI'm only half-joking in this proposal."
