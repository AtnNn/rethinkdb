      "> A feed is NOT a stream like we currently have. They are two complete different things.\r\n\r\nI think this is the crux of the disagreement -- I think that feeds ARE exactly like streams.  It's just a sequence of objects which sometimes requires network traffic to produce more objects.  I'm not opposed to providing an event-style API for dealing with those types of sequences, but we should provide the same event-style API for `r.table('test')` and `r.table('test').changes()` if we do so."
