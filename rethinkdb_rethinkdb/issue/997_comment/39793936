      "> What if they want to run some JS? Or generate a random number (e.g. if they want to randomly sample 10% of changes to reduce network traffic)?\r\n\r\nIf they want to run JS, tell them to take a hike (for now).  You'd have to go out-of-process on every row.  (If we supported concurrently mapping and filtering, then JS could be reasonable, much moreso than a query that would go to disk.)\r\n\r\nSomebody wanting to randomly sample changes is plausible, and might be a reason we'd allow the complexity of (fast) nondeterministic changes.  It's a moot point for now, since we don't have r.random.\r\n\r\nThe notion of using r.now where \"now\" is the time the filter function is evaluation is just pointless (and it requires changing the implementation).  There is no value in that.   The client might as well ask itself what the time is.  Also, it's potentially surprising behavior."
