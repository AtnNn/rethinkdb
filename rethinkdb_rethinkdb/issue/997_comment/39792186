      "> I'm really confused now. Isn't the master, itself, a replica? That is, isn't the master capable of serving writes and reads?\r\n\r\nNo.  Having a replica be on the same machine as a master (in which colloquially speaking the master is one of the replicas) is usually sensible and what happens automatically, but the user can manually set where the shards go in the admin CLI.  (It could plausibly make sense to set things up this way, if you want to begin all your writes in a datacenter with no need for replicas, and only want out-of-date reads from the other ones.)"
