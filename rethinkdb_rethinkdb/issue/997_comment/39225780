      "FWIW, I would enthusiastically support delaying or removing plans for triggers. The latest proposal from @coffeemug (essentially a \"lossy\" feed) strikes me as very easy to reason about as a user.\r\n\r\nI'd also be happy with using `since=token` to replay anything I missed - it makes sense that as an external listener, it's my responsibility to remediate any missed updates. I'm immediately wondering what happens when I ask for `since=0` (or equivalent); would that eventually return the entire database?"
