      "WRT my previous comment on `filter`, I thought about it a bit more. I think we should only allow `onChange` on a table because this is the only way it makes sense. I think we should let them tack on a `filter` after `onChange` -- this would let them filter by event type, or only for specific changes based on some condition. There is a general question, though, what should be the type of the return value for `onChange` (and consequently, what are we allowed to do on that type)?"
