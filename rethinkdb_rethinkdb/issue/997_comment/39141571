      "Also, this proposal has the following limitations:\r\n\r\n* If the client disconnects and reconnects, they will miss changes that happened in the interim.\r\n* If the client can't read fast enough, they will miss a bunch of changes.\r\n* This is *not* a replacement for JMS/RabbitMQ/Tibco/etc.\r\n\r\nI'm ok with all these limitations. I think working around them would be unnecessarily overcomplicating things, and we shouldn't do that right now."
