      "Under the current proposal if somebody does a few large batched inserts, every change feed will disconnect.  If a bunch of clients do any moderately sustained write workload, every change feed will disconnect.  Allowing nondeterministic transformations will cause users to use slow transformations and wonder why RethinkDB change feeds are so broken, resulting in support requests that we have to apologize for.  Allowing nondeterministic transformations will force actual good implementations of change feeds to include special-case code for handling them. Which replica will a change feed listen for changes from?  What's the behavior if that replica goes down but writes are happening to other replicas?  The behavior of r.now is still unspecified!\r\n"
