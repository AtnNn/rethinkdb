      "i think any operation applied after the `.changes(...)` should operate on each individual change, not aggregate them. Incidentally, this would make it `.do(...)` instead of `.for_each(...)`, and `.to_array()` will not break everything.  Is there a reason you would want to operate on all the changes?  A `.reduce(...)`, maybe?"
