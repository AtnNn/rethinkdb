      "> It would be stupid not to, it'd be letting values buffer for no reason. That's not the case with order_by.\r\n\r\nYou might want to only apply the `map` before sending changes to a client (to avoid mapping over changes that are never consumed), so if a client requests a batch of changes you could map over them in parallel.  (In any case, even if the best implementation is always to map over them in order, there's nothing in the type which forbids mapping out of order.)"
