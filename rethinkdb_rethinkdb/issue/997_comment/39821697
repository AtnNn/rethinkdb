      "Also note, we'll have to figure out what happens when the user types `r.table('foo').changes()` in the data explorer. It would be really nice if the data explorer knew that it's dealing with a feed, so I now thinking @neumino's suggestion of informing the client that this is a feed cursor (via a boolean flag?) is a good idea."
