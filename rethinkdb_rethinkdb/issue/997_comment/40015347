      "@srh: It matters, because we only miss writes if the master goes down. Aborting any query reading from a feed when the master goes down is acceptable and probably expected, and a master getting lost is a well defined event.\r\nA secondary being unavailable is more tricky, because writes will often still go through, and we are not sure if the replica is just temporarily unavailable (i.e. we should not abort feeds but just keep waiting) or permanently down (i.e. we should abort feeds),"
