      "> Do you think we should always do that, or should it be configurable somewhere?\r\n\r\nIf it's configurable it should be the default.\r\n\r\n> Also, how do you want things to behave if someone opens a changefeed and forgets about it?\r\n\r\nJust like with overlarge arrays, they should be disk-backed (like, serialize them compressed to a mmapped buffer, and let the OS do its thing -- maybe worrying a bit about 32-bit systems).  Fortunately with change feeds that's easy to do reasonably.\r\n\r\nWhether they're disk backed or not, you have to tell the client to gtfo at some point, so kill the connection or the cursor, I don't know."
