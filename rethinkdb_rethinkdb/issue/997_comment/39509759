      "Wait, are we talking about a JS function called `toArray`, or `coerce_to('ARRAY')` on the server?\r\n\r\nIn general you shouldn't take streams and call `toArray` on them in the client unless you *know* they're small.  There's no guarantee it will ever terminate -- if you write `r.table('test').run.to_array` and someone else is inserting at the end of `test` faster than you're reading from it, you're out of luck.  (Also, in the common case where your table doesn't fit in memory on the client, you're out of luck anyway.)"
