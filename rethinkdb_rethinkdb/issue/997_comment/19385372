      "> yuck\r\n\r\nI disagree. I think embedding node into the server and allowing access to it from `r.js` can be an extremely powerful primitive. This way triggers can run even when there are no clients connected, which is what one wants. Requiring a client to be connected for the triggers to work introduces all sorts of deployment issues that are very non-trivial for the users to resolve.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I didn't think of allowing triggers to bubble up events all the way up to the clients. We should definitely explore that."
