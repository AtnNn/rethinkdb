      "Can we create a new type what `changes` is going to return?\r\n\r\nIn JavaScript, people probably want an object where they can bind listener `on(\"data\"/\"error\"/\"close\", callback)` (something like that http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html).\r\n\r\n@coffeemug mentionned creating a cursor for Python but that would block. I think that we should expect people to create a new process, it's not really friendly.\r\nCould we create a new class where people would just have to overwrite some methods?\r\n\r\nI think ruby doesn't have this problem with blocks -- but @mlucy probably knows better.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne last thing, are we going to ping the connection?\r\nIf I subscribe to a feed, and there is no activity on the TCP connection, Linux is going to close it (the default timeout is 2 hours). So could we make sure that we don't get disconnected."
