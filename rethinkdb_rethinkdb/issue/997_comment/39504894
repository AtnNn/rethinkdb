      "A changefeed is just a stream of objects, where sometimes getting the next object requires going to the server.  We already have an interface (cursors) which does exactly that.  We shouldn't provide two interfaces for doing the same thing in slightly different contexts.\r\n\r\nIf we want to switch to supporting an event-style interface (which might be totally reasonable; I don't know much about JS), then we should probably use that same interface everywhere.  There's no reason cursors or connections couldn't support an event-style interface too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
