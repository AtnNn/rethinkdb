      "@kofalt we haven't been been updating this issue too much but I think we've agreed internally that a change feed is a better way to accomplish this than packaging runtimes internally. One of the biggest disadvantages of packaging runtimes is that it in distributed environments it's tough to tell which machine your code is going to run on. This can be a problem if you have some machines behind a firewall while others aren't. A stream of changes you can access through the query language and dispatch however you want in whatever language you're already using really sounds like the best solution to me.\r\n\r\nThis functionality is unfortunately a ways off. It's probably not making it in before production readiness."
