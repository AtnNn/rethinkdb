      "@ndarilek @neumino I don't think this is what @mlucy meant. The terminology might be a bit confusing here:\r\nA replica is any node that holds data for a shard. Every shard already needs to have at least one replica, otherwise you couldn't store any data in it. Right now the \"master\" role is independent of the \"replica\" role. This is something purely internal. From the user's perspective, we already always put a replica on the master. @mlucy's suggestion if I understand it correctly is to enforce that constraint also internally."
