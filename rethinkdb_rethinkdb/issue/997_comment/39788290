      "I think we should allow nondeterministic transformations.  There are lots of situations where they're OK.  In general, I don't think we should use nondeterminism as a proxy for slowness -- we should just kick off cursors that are reading too slowly with a reasonable error message.\r\n\r\nI'd have to think more about the specific implementation details.  I think the buffering should be per-server-with-cursors so that when a changefeed requests more data there doesn't need to be intracluster traffic to fetch it.\r\n\r\n"
