      "> I think this is the crux of the disagreement -- I think that feeds ARE exactly like streams\r\nOk, everything makes sense now.\r\n\r\nI had a different idea of what we were calling a feed. I was expecting the server to push data to the driver on the connection. Then the driver would then fire an event/call a method with the change and immediately discard the data.\r\n\r\n> This way seems better because in the case where the number of changes produced outpaces the client's ability to handle those changes, you don't just fill up memory on the client -- you fill up memory on the server, \r\n\r\nThis sounds wrong to me. We send back an array as one big chunk to avoid filling up the memory of the server and don't really care about the memory of the client.\r\nI'm not working on the ReQL layer, so I don't feel strongly about that, but it still somehow feels not safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would have a few more questions on how the feed will work.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding of the system, this will happen\r\n```\r\nfeed = r.table(\"test\").changes().run(conn)\r\nr.table(\"test\").get(1).update({\"foo\": 1}).run(conn)\r\nr.table(\"test\").get(1).update({\"foo\": 2}).run(conn)\r\nchange = feed.next() # {\"foo\": 1}\r\nchange = feed.next() # {\"foo\": 1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr are we going to copy the changes? In which case\r\n- Are we going to copy the old value too so we can send it back?\r\n- Isn't it dangerous if people run update on a whole table? We would buffer the whole table?\r\n"
