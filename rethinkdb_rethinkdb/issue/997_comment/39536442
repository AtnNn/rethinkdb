      "- I agree with @mlucy (and disagree with @neumino and @Tryneus) on the API -- I think `changes()` should just return a normal stream (which in all current drivers is represented by a normal cursor).\r\n- I also agree with @mlucy that we shouldn't worry about async stuff in Ruby/Python or the `.on(...)` API in JavaScript. We can provide that API to cursors (and arguably should), and this API would probably be nicer for feeds, but I don't think we should worry about it as part of this issue. I'd ship the cursor API, wait and see what the users say, and deal with the issue of a different API later (though I suspect we won't have to for a while).\r\n- I agree with @atnnn that we should gracefully handle table deletion by ending the stream (though it would be a rare enough case).\r\n\r\n@mlucy -- what are the options for `for_each` that you can think of?"
