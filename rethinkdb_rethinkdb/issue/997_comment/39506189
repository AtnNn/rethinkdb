      "I would like the change my suggestion from before regarding a change feed with `.for_each(...)`.  Blocking the connection is annoying and actually makes no sense in the JS driver.  It should return a cursor just like other change feeds and end the change feed when closed.  Whatever the for_each returns (or errors) would be the data retrieved in the cursor."
