      "I now realize my above comment is insufficiently precise: to be clear, the first paragraph is in support of `r.table('users').onChange` over something like `r.createTrigger`.\r\n\r\nBoth could be referred to as triggers I suppose, but the first example is more of a \"change feed\", which is simpler and less prone to confusion over opaque database-stored logic.\r\n\r\nExperience with multiple companies that made extensive use of MSSQL triggers predictably lead to irritation over what basically amounts to hidden magic. Philosophically, business logic belongs in your application, not storage, and the `onChange` proposal is well suited for that approach."
