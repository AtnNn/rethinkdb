      "Consistency between method names is a good thing. That allows for example people to easily \"translate\" queries from JavaScript (or the data explorer) to Python and Ruby.\r\nBut we are currently talking about consistency in the drivers' representation of a feed. Just a reminder: `GROUPED_DATA` is represented in different ways in JavaScript, Python and Ruby -- we even went to introduce `frozenset` in Python for that. The same goes for dates.\r\n\r\nTastes are subjective, and there is little incentive to try to convince each other. I would still think that my tastes for the Node API are probably closer to what our users expect.\r\n\r\nA feed is NOT a stream like we currently have. They are two complete different things.\r\nThe feed pushes document to the client, while the client pull data from a stream.\r\n\r\nIn JavaScript, `toArray` and `hasNext` don't work on feed. So using the same interface is silly.\r\n\r\nThat's about it for the JavaScript API.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nAbout providing a non blocking API. I'm not familiar enough with Ruby so I'll just talk a little about Python.\r\n\r\nTelling our users to create a new process if they want to listen to a feed is wrong. Processes in Python are everything but friendly.\r\n\r\nIt would take us some time to provide a nice interface, but if we don't, we will put the burden on each of our users. We should aim for #1000 \r\n\r\nWe won't be able to write a clean/nice example to showcase feeds, which remove one of the main reason why we wanted to ship triggers.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks @grizwako for the suggestions!\r\nWe should take a look at the links @grizwako posted."
