      "Ok, sounds fair.\r\n\r\nCould we just have the server send back a new type? -- different than `PARTIAL_SEQUENCE`, let's say `FEED`?\r\n\r\nThe drivers would now just consider it as a partial sequence, but that way if we decide at some point to provide an aynchronous API, we can just start working on the drivers without having to wait for an update on the server. And community drivers can provide another interface if they want to."
