      "> There is no write query logic that asks whether a replica is on the same machine as the master.\r\n\r\nRight, but I apparently misunderstood how the write query logic works.  How does it actually work?  The write goes to the master, the master dispatches it to the replicas, then one special replica responds and says \"I wrote this to disk\", then the master says \"OK it was written\" and sends the result back to the server hosting the query?"
