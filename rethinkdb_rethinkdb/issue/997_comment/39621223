      "> I think this is the crux of the disagreement -- I think that feeds ARE exactly like streams.\r\n\r\n@mlucy Of course they are not.  Feeds are infinite and streams are not.  Feeds always have an ordering and streams sometimes don't.  \"Streams\" in ReQL do not have to be processed in any particular order, even when they do have an ordering.  (The name \"stream\" is a complete misnaming.)  The ReQL type system does not allow feeds to be streams."
