      "Well, you might think it's resolved but you should still drop nondeterministic query support, and get ready to add a \"non-slow\" query category later.  It's a certainty that we'll have to drop it for all but a few operations (r.random, maybe r.now) and implementing r.now is going to require mucking with its query-rewriting code (it's also questionable in general because its meaning is ambiguous, as has been mentioned and ignored).  Adding a new category of query and using that later is an easy fix if we want to do that."
