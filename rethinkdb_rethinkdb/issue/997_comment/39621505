      "There are severe problems with implementing any kind of `feed.for_each(...).run(...)`.  Think about the unknown unknowns.  Please raise your hand if your spidey sense isn't tingling.\r\n\r\n> We'll never buffer a whole table; if we buffer too many changes in the server (say more than the array size limit) we'll discard them and any cursors which are too far behind will get an error. (Alternatively, we could skip a few and give those cursors a warning.)\r\n\r\nOr we can throttle incoming writes.  People would want that.\r\n "
