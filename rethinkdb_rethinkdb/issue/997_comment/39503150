      "While it could work, this is not how people use Node.js and I think we should follow Node's conventions if we can.\r\nIt's also kind of the same issue as https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/221\r\n\r\nThe class net.socket for example works with events\r\nhttp://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_event_connect . You create a socket then listen to some events.\r\n\r\nAlso on IRC:\r\n```\r\n12:44:49 - ins0mnia: neumino: +1 on your last comment https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/997\r\n```\r\nSo people care about that."
