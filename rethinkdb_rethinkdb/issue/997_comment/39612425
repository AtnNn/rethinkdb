      "An alternative format would be:\r\n```\r\n{ row: PRIMARY_KEY_VALUE,\r\n  type: {DELETE,INSERT,UPDATE,REPLACE},\r\n  change: JSON }\r\n```\r\nWhere `change` is NULL for a delete, the row inserted for an insert or replace, and the changed fields for an update.  I'm sort of leaning toward starting with the more verbose interface, because it's consistent and gives more information.  We could always add an alternate compressed format later (e.g. `.changes(format:'patch')` to mean \"just send the patch applied to the object\")."
