      "> I was thinking we would just send `{old_val: ..., new_val: ...}`.\r\n\r\nI like this a lot more. It's consistent with what we do with `return_vals` (or `return_changes` as we agreed to rename the optarg), it gives people all the info they need, and I don't think we should worry about network traffic for the first version of this."
