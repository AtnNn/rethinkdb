      "How opposed would people be to requiring that people have at least one replica on the master?  It would make implementing this easier because we wouldn't have to worry about writes happening while one of the replicas serving a changefeed is down.  I don't think anyone is actually running with a replica-less master setup, so the cost seems minimal.  (@srh, @danielmewes, @coffeemug, thoughts?)"
