      "@mlucy ungrouped transformations?  So, are nondeterministic transformations allowed?\r\n\r\n> Change feeds are buffered on the server on a per-server per-table basis. If a client subscribed to a change feed falls more than ARRAY_LIMIT elements behind, it gets kicked off with an error. This is the simplest implementation that I think is actually sane and useful.\r\n\r\nThis is an imprecise explanation.  Do they get buffered on each parser?  Do they get buffered on the tables' servers?  How do changes get sent from the tables to the buffers?\r\n"
