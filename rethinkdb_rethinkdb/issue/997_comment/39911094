      "@coffeemug -- `sample` isn't an ungrouped transformation or `limit`, so it won't be allowed on feeds.  Also, `for_each` will be disallowed, at least initially.  (We probably shouldn't implement it until we have some generic method for detaching jobs from connections and stopping them later, and maybe not even then.)\r\n\r\nI'm torn on support for nondeterministic queries.  @coffeemug, do you have an opinion?  I guess I'm sort of leaning toward forbidding them at first, or requiring people to explicitly allow them with some analog to the `non_atomic` flag in updates.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to add a feed/stream hint to the Response so that the data explorer could distinguish."
