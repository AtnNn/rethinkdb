      "About blocking in python, you have probably heard about asyncio stuff in 3.4 and yield from in 3.3.\r\nBut you can also use generators to do async stuff, if i recall correctly, it is since 2.5 and i do not think you need to support older versions than that.\r\n\r\nhttp://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0342/  (coroutine vai gen, 2.5)\r\n\r\nhttp://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/  (yield from, 3.3, nice way of handling async stuff)\r\n\r\nhttp://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/  (asyncio aka tulip, 3.4 can be used in 3.3 via tlip library i think)"
