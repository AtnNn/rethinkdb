      "@danielmewes We also miss writes when the parser goes down.  Or when the client goes down.  So worries about missing writes is an invalid reason. If a replica were on the parser, we'd want to stream changes from that instead.  If a replica were in the same datacenter as the parser, and the master were not, the same is true."
