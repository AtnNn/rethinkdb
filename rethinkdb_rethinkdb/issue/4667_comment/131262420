      "Even though it would make the error clearer in this particular case, I think we should be careful about adding more knowledge about the number of allowed arguments to the drivers than absolutely necessary. It increases the maintenance burden whenever we change the signature of a term, and makes it harder for users running older drivers to make access new server features."
