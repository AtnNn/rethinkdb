      "@cacois I think you need to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncursor.eachAsync(row => {\r\n    return processRowAsync(row)\r\n      .then(() => undefined) // prevent \"may only return a Promise or undefined\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, `eachAsync` checks the result of the returned promise to make sure you're not accidentally throwing away values you might care about from inner promises. I think it's mostly just leading to confusion though and I think we should consider changing it."
