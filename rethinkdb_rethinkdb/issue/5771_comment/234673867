      "> Yeah I'd be in favor of dropping the check on what a returned promise resolves to. I think it's not very helpful and makes it harder to work with eachAsync.\r\n\r\nIt's mildly helpful because it prevents you from thinking that the promise you return inside `eachAsync` is going somewhere, and encourages you to chain on a `.then` to check for errors if you're running ReQL queries inside the `eachAsync`, but I agree that it probably causes more pain than it prevents, since sometimes it won't fail until you hit a particular branch at runtime."
