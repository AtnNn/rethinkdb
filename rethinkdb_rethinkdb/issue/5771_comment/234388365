      "@cacois: you are using ES6 notation there, what happens if you just use the older `function (row) {}` notation? My initial thought is that it should not matter, but I am mostly trapped in working with the older notation, so there could be subtleties that I are not picking up there.\r\n\r\nNote that I am biting my tongue hard here, but I have been in favor of handling promises in almost all of these cases."
