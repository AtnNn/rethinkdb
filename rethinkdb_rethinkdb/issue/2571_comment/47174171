      "Hmm.  We could call it a \"sub-index\".\r\n\r\nI think we want the behavior that if they write `sub_index: [position]` for an index it really means `.between([position], [position, r.maxval])`.  So you can omit tags from the righthand side to do a wildcard search on that tag.  (Writing that, I think you're right that we shouldn't call them tags.)"
