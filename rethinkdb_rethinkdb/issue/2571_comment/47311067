      "Looks solid. Some questions and usability considerations:\r\n\r\n- Compound index syntax may be finicky but the alternate syntax proposed with `tags` made even less sense, at least for me.\r\n- Your users will appreciate `toGeoJSON` is named after what it does.\r\n- Nautical mile (`nm`) is very useful, consider adding it.\r\n- No `getFarthest`? :crying_cat_face: \r\n- Shouldn't polygons be also accepting the system as optarg?\r\n- Only `geoRectangle` has the prefix `geo`. Typo?"
