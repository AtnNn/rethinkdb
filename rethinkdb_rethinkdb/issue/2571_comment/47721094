      "The tags API has a few advantages:\r\n* It's simple.\r\n* It doesn't involve modifying our type system.\r\n* It avoids subtle inconsistencies with other uses of compound indexes.\r\n* It avoids adding more functionality to an already-confusing feature.\r\n\r\nI think I'm leaning toward it too (although a chaining API like @neumino suggested would be very cool if we thought about it more).\r\n\r\nSome ideas for the optarg:\r\n* `tags`\r\n* `sub_index`\r\n* `properties`"
