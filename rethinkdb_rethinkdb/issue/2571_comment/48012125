      "Just to be sure, we can chain `getIntersecting` with `getAll` and `between` as long it uses the same compound index.\r\nBut I cannot chain multiple `getAll` and `between` right? We will deal with that later, right?\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't get what does `exact: true` does.\r\nWhat is the difference these two queries:\r\n```\r\nr.table('restaurants').getIntersecting(polygon, { index: 'idx2', exact: true })\r\nr.table('restaurants').getIntersecting(polygon, { index: 'idx2'})\r\n```\r\nDoes the first one return only if `idx2` for a restaurant map to a polygon and not a point?\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does `getNearest` play with compound index?\r\nDo we chain `getNearest(...).between(...)`? Or `between(...).getNearest(...)`?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
