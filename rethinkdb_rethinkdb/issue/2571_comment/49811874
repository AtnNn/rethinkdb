      "> My preferred solution would be to extend the predicate term intersects() to be applicable to streams in addition to single objects, and act like a filter. I believe we already do that for a couple of other predicates in ReQL (such as hasFields() I think?), don't we?\r\n\r\n> I would also like to hear @mlucy 's opinion on this.\r\n\r\nThat sounds good to me."
