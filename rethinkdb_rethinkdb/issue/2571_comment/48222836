      "> We can throw an error if someone tries to convert a rectangle to a geohash.\r\n\r\nNo I meant a given geohash describes a rectangle (I mean something defined by four points, the angles are not usually 90 degrees). So if we want to convert *from* a geohash, we would get a rectangle. \r\n\r\nI don't fully understand the need for geohashes in sharing positions. Couldn't one just encode longitude and latitude in the URL? Geohashes seem more relevant for indexing. That being said, I guess Geohashes *are* used in URLs for whatever reason. So it might make sense to support them."
