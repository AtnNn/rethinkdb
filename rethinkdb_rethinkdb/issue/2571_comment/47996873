      "* I think we should take equality queries on geo indexes out of this proposal.  It's easy to add later.\r\n* I also think we should use `to_json`.  I think if you have a point, `point.to_json` should produce `'{\"$reql_type$\": \"geoJSON\", \"type\": \"point\", ...}'`.  `r.json` will parse pseudotypes and turn it back into a geoJSON point internally.  In general, I think anything that can be stored in a table should support `.to_json` to produce a string, and calling `r.json` on that string should get you back the same value."
