      "> Just to be sure, we can chain `getIntersecting` with `getAll` and `between` as long it uses the same compound index. But I cannot chain multiple `getAll` and `between` right? We will deal with that later, right?\r\n\r\nThat's correct, that's what I intended with the original proposal.\r\n\r\n> I don't get what does `exact: true` does.\r\n\r\nForget it, it was a really bad idea.\r\n\r\n> [...] toGeoJSON [...]\r\n\r\nI'm ok with adding `toGeoJSON`. Also, I think we should have a `geoFormat` optarg, similarly to have we have `timeFormat` and friends."
