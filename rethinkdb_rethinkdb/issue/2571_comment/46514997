      "@AtnNn Everything here assumes geometry on the surface of a sphere (of maybe ellipsoid, I think S2 supports correcting for the shape of the earth based on the WGS84 system). We would implement this using S2 https://code.google.com/p/s2-geometry-library/ (MongoDB does the same, but also supports Euclidean geometry which we can add later and switch on via opt args).\r\n\r\nThe shortest distance is not ambiguous (apparently the definition of distances we would use is actually called great-circle distance http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance). Lines between two points are ambiguous if the points are on opposite sides of the sphere. We could avoid the problem though by defining one line as the canonical one (add an implicit third point that the line must go through).\r\n\r\nCrossing the 180 degree line should be possible."
