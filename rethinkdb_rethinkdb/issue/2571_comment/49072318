      "I agree that the command should be polymorphic on streams, however we don't have precedent for commands that run on objects, streams, and accept an index optarg only when run on streams (that would be pretty weird). I'm not quite sure what to do about that, other than having two functions `getIntersecting` as specified above, and a second intersection function that works on geometry objects and streams. (That's also a bit weird, so I guess we have to decide on the lesser of the two evils)"
