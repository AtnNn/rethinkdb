      "> I believe it's not the same as get_farthest() because the earth is not a perfect sphere (if it was, it would be equivalent), but it might be sufficiently close for many applications.\r\n\r\nI agree it's not the actual farthest point. That's why I would be opposed to just aliasing this trick as `get_farthest`. Also, one of the proposal versions mentioned the assumption that the earth is a perfect sphere for distance calculations.\r\n\r\n> @grandquista @hcarvalhoalves do you have any specific use gases for get_farthest() in mind?\r\n\r\nMy personal road trips have been planed around the farthest point in a group of interesting destinations."
