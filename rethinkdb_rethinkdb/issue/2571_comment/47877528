      "Two things:\r\n\r\n* I don't like `getIntersecting` with the `exact: true` flag. That sounds like a contradiction to me, because it's not doing an intersection test anymore but a different kind of test (a more strict one). Why should `getAll()` not work to query the value by the value of a geo index just like you can use it to query by the value of a non-geo index?\r\n\r\n* As discussed above I prefer `toGeoJSON` over `toJSON`. @Tryneus also mentioned that we probably want `toJSON()` to be reversible by applying `r.json()` to its result, which wouldn't be the case for Geo JSON documents (`r.json()` would make them regular objects, not geometry)."
