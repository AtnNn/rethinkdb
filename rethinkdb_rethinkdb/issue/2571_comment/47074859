      "> I would also strongly consider leaving compound indexes off of the initial interface/implementation, just so that we have less to discuss right now and less to implement. (The only reason not to do this would be if all the real use cases of geo-indexing require it. @coffeemug, do you have a sense of this?)\r\n\r\nA common case is when you build an Android app that integrates a kind of social network. You want to know friends that are close by.\r\nIn which case you need a compound index.\r\n\r\nMongo also supports a compound index with a geospatial index if I'm not mistaken."
