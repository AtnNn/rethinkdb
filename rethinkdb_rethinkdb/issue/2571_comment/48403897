      "> I think `geo_format` should have two possible values -- `raw` and `geoJSON`.\r\n\r\nThis would be bad as described, because `geoJSON` wouldn't be rereadable.  You'd get a row, go to insert it back in, and the type of your locations will change from `geoJSON` to `object`.  I think we should only support `raw`, but the `raw` format should be identical to geoJSON except for the `$reql_type$` field."
