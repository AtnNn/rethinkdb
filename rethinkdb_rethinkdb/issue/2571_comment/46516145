      "@mlucy:  `[x, polygon, y]` wouldn't typically be efficient, which is why I think we should limit geometry to the last entry of such a query (i.e. `[x, y, polygon]`).\r\n\r\nHow would you do \"distance less than ... from ...\" with that `get_all()` syntax?\r\n\r\nIt also wouldn't work if you had multiple geometric predicates in a composite index, though I guess we would disallow that anyway."
