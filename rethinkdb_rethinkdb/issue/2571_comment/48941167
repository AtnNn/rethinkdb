      "One thing that I didn't think about in the proposal:\r\n\r\nDo we want `getIntersecting(g)` to work without an index (it would just become `.filter(r.row().intersects(g))` )?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, `intersects()` could just work on streams.\r\n\r\nI think the `intersects()`-on-streams approach is more consistent with our current terms, in that all of our existing `get...` terms always use an index. I would prefer that, and suggest making the `{index: ...}` opt arg mandatory for `getIntersecting()`."
