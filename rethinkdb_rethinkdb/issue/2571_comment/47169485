      "I think that we should use the yelp app use case as a general reference point (e.g. \"give me all Chinese restaurants within a five mile radius of here\"). If we're good for that use case, I think the geo feature will be a success because it covers 90% of mobile use cases out there. Here are some properties it has:\r\n\r\n- The geo index has immensely good cardinality because the world is really big, and the number of points of interest within a reasonable radius is really small by comparison\r\n- A tag on points within a given radius will also have good cardinality because there are many points of interest within a reasonable radius of many different kinds (restaurants close to here that have five star reviews)\r\n\r\nSo I think for version one we should:\r\n\r\n- Only allow the geo index as the first element in the compound index. I don't think we should worry about having the geo index anywhere in the compound index for v1, we can deal with that later.\r\n- Allow wildcards/ranges. Though I think we should build the feature and merge into next without it, and then see if we can add it.\r\n\r\nAs far as the compound indexing syntax, I think we should use our current syntax. If it's confusing, we should fix the syntax in general. I don't think we should create a specialized syntax for the geo feature (though I can definitely see the appeal)."
