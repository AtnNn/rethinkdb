      "@danielmewes -- I think `geo_format` should have two possible values -- `raw` and `geoJSON`. In the former case the driver will return the pseudotype, in the latter proper geojson format. (Basically, the only difference would be the `__reql_type__` field).\r\n\r\nI don't think we should worry about representing geometry objects in native objects in different languages -- it's a lot of work, it's unclear if anyone would use such a feature, and lots of languages have competing geometry libraries."
