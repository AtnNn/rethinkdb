      "Another thing I'd like to revisit is the `r.rectangle()` term.\r\n\r\nThe way it works now is that it creates a rectangle on the Mercator projection (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection) of the geometry.\r\n\r\nIt can be useful because many maps are drawn that way, and you can use it for example to conveniently query for items visible in a given rectangular piece of the map (like when visualizing a map for a website).\r\nHowever its function might be more specific than its name suggests, since it assumes a certain projection.\r\nThe term is already implemented and super simple, so that's not a problem.\r\n\r\nI'm undecided whether we should keep it in as it is, remove it, or rename it (to `mercator_rectangle()`? Though that's an ugly name.). Opinions?"
