      "It looks excellent and will totally rock, but two (not so) minor nitpicks:\r\n\r\n- All constructors should accept `lat, lon` parameters in this order to adhere to the standard (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_6709#Order.2C_sign.2C_and_units).  This is always an endless source of confusion in dealing with APIs.\r\n- Should also avoid using `x` and `y` as parameter names, these terms are overloaded semantically and coordinates are not cartesian."
