      "Just a quick clarification @grandquista:\r\n> Also, one of the proposal versions mentioned the assumption that the earth is a perfect sphere for distance calculations.\r\n\r\nThat was only for computing the intersection between polygons and/or lines. `getNearest()` and `distance()` will use the WGS84 reference ellipsoid."
