      "To add to the proposal of disallowing incomplete compound queries with geo indexes: This would be a restriction we could lift at a later point of course.\r\nIt would however significantly simplify the implementation for the first version, and keep the interface a little smaller in scope (since we don't have to handle things like `between()` queries)."
