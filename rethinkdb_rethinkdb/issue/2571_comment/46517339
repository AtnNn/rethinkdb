      "> So far we have intersection, inclusion and equality. You propose assuming intersection by default, and switching to inclusion through a flag. What I don't like about that is that it gives special treatment to intersection. Why should intersection be the default?\r\n\r\nIf you think of the shape as a set of keys, \"intersection\" is just \"any entry which matches one of the keys in the set\", which seems intuitive to me.  But I could see how it would be non-intuitive too."
