      "Well, a typical query someone might want to do is \"find all gas stations within a certain distance\". So you would build a compound index `[POI_category, position]` and query on that.\r\nRequiring geospatial criteria to be the last criteria when filtering on a compound index doesn't sound unreasonable. That would be the only rule we would need I think."
