      "- Do we have\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"users').getNearest(point, {index: \"geoCompound\"}).getAll(1,2,3,4, {index: \"geoCompound\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"users').getAll(1,2,3,4, {index: \"geoCompound\"}).getNearest(point, {index: \"geoCompound\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess we'll go for the first one, but it somehow seems wrong to me (I haven't figure out why yet, but I find it really really strange - does somehow feel the same?).\r\n\r\n- What happens if I just execute\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"users').getIntersecting(point, {index: \"geoCompound\"})\r\n```\r\nWhere `geoCompound` is a compound index.\r\nDo I get an error? Or do I get the results?\r\n\r\n- For this query, what happens if 1 is really far from point? (or if there is no match for `1`)\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"users').getNearest(point, {index: \"geoCompound\"}).getAll(1, {index: \"geoCompound\"})\r\n```\r\nWe talked about a maximum of element returned. Do we have a maximum radius from which we stop searching? Will these settings be optargs?\r\n\r\n- Are we sure we don't want to support geohash? It seems pretty useful to me when it comes to building a REST API."
