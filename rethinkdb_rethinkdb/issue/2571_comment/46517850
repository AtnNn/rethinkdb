      "What would `table.between(...)` do on that index?  What about `table.order_by(...)`?\r\n\r\nIt's still not too clear to me what it even means to have a compound index where one of the elements is 1-dimensional and another is 2-dimensional.  Would we use a projection of the geoJSON as a 1-dimensional stand-in for things like `between` and `order_by`?"
