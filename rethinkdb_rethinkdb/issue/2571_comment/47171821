      "Thinking about it more, part of the reason using compound indexes here bother me is that outside of this case, \"compound indexes\" is just a fancy name for the fact that arrays in normal indexes sort the way you want them too.  Here, we're attaching special rules and special interpretations to it (\"geo data goes in the first spot, and rather than defining an array with a particular key value, you're defining a set of keys based on the data in the first spot\").\r\n\r\nRegular compound indexes are arrays because the semantics of using arrays as keys happen to line up with the desired semantics for compound indexes.  Here, we're using arrays as a syntax for something totally unrelated -- we're just using them to bundle values together."
