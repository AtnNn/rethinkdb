      "@hcarvalhoalves Thank you again for the feedback\r\n\r\n> Nautical mile (`nm`) is very useful, consider adding it.\r\n\r\nGood to know. Will do.\r\n\r\n> No `getFarthest`? :crying_cat_face: \r\n\r\nThis is slightly more difficult to support than `getNearest`, as it will typically expose pathological cases where the point that's farthest away is approximately on the opposite side of the earth. Many simpler algorithms for computing geodesic distances become slow, unstable or unusable in such cases. We can consider it later.\r\n\r\n> Shouldn't polygons be also accepting the system as optarg?\r\n\r\nSince polygons are constructed by means of points, they do not depend on distances and don't need a reference system. Circles need it because they rely directly on distances. In theory, the lines that connect polygon points *do* depend on the reference system, which can make a difference when testing for intersection. However we will always assume a perfect sphere in those cases, which is very close to earth's actual geometry. The error is negligible for polygon intersection as long as the points that define a polygon don't get too far apart (relative to earth's radius).\r\n\r\n> Only `geoRectangle` has the prefix `geo`. Typo?\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing that out. Yes, that's a typo. It should also be `rectangle()`. I'm going to edit the proposal."
