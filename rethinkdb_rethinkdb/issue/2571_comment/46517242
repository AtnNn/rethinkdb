      "> If I do getAll(\"abcde\") I don't search for strings that contain the string \"abcde\". I search for strings equal to \"abcde\". I would assume that the same holds for geometry. Everything else would be very confusing in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI can see that.  I guess in my mind \"abcde\" is a single key in a 1-D index, while a geometric shape is a set of keys in a 2-D index.  If we had a data type representing a set of keys in a 1-D index (like `r.range(0, 5)`, which we keep talk about adding), it would make sense to me for `get_all` to treat that as a set of keys as well."
