      "We could also represent such compount queries through the `table.intersects(polygon, {index: ...})` / `table.is_contained(polygon, {index: ...})` syntax as follows, though it doesn't seem super elegant:\r\n`table.intersects(X, Y, polygon, {index: 'compound'})` would assume that all but the last parameters are equality-constraints on the value of the compound index.\r\n\r\nEdit: Removed the word non-geospatial. X and Y would be interpreted as equality constraint, no matter what their type is."
