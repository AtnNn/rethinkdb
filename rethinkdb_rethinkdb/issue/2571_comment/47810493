      "@grandquista \r\n\r\n>  Could an antipode() function be added to the proposal? This would find the point on the opposite side of the earth, and allow p1.antipode.get_nearest to be used to find the farthest point.\r\n\r\nOh that's a neat idea. I believe it's not the same as `get_farthest()` because the earth is not a perfect sphere (if it was, it would be equivalent), but it might be sufficiently close for many applications.\r\n\r\n@grandquista @hcarvalhoalves do you have any specific use gases for `get_farthest()` in mind?\r\n\r\n"
