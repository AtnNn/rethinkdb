      "I'm really happy to see support for this coming, it's also timely.  My needs are pretty limited, essentially records with a point inside a circle/range .,, I've been using mongodb but hoping to convert to rethink.  I was going to use a hack, when a range query happens to get a list of zip codes in that range, and then match against that set of zip/postal codes as an interim solution.\r\n\r\nIs there any estimated time table on this?  \r\n\r\n"
