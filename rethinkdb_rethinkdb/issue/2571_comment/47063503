      "This looks good to me.  I like this interface a lot better.  I would also strongly consider leaving compound indexes off of the initial interface/implementation, just so that we have less to discuss right now and less to implement.  (The only reason not to do this would be if all the real use cases of geo-indexing require it.  @coffeemug, do you have a sense of this?)"
