      "I'm sort of getting the sense that compound indexes + geo data don't work well together.  Compound indexes are very general and can be used for either point gets or range scans, whereas it sounds like compound indexes with geo data inside of them would basically only be used to let you do a geo-indexed query and only retain elements matching a particular set of tags.  It might be better to support that some other way, rather than adding a bunch of very specific rules to compound indexes to produce that behavior."
