      "> Do we want `getIntersecting(g)` to work without an index (it would just become `.filter(r.row().intersects(g))` )?\r\n\r\nAh, yes we do! I'm on board with replacing `getIntersecting` with a command that takes an index as an optarg that's actually optional. I think we should think a bit about the name though, because we already have `setIntersection`, and will potentially add another command for intersection on bags. How about `geoIntersection`?"
