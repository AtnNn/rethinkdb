      "Actually, what would you guys think of taking equality queries on geo indexes out of this proposal?\r\n\r\nPeople could already achieve such a query through `table.getIntersecting(g, {index: g_idx}).filter(r.row().eq(g))`, which would be slower than a directly optimized equality query by only a constant factor. I imagine equality on geometry is also a relatively rare query, compared to intersection and getNearest.\r\n\r\nAnd as @coffeemug pointed out one can still put geometry into a non-geo index for best performance on that type of query."
