      "> TODO: We have to define some unit for the radius. One way would be the distance as a fraction of the circumference of the reference sphere (earth). If we want to use absolute units (miles, km), we would need a way to define the reference circumference (using earth's by default). A third option is specifying distances in terms of the angle between two points on a sphere's surface (with the sphere's center as the third point)\r\n\r\nSpecifying fractions of a circumference sounds painful.  For actual geo queries, I think you'd either want miles or longitude/latitude."
