      "Actually, one more sticking point: I'm not 100% sure the `fill` interface is intuitive.  I could see someone making two circles thinking that they're filled circles by default, and being confused that e.g. concentric circles don't intersect.  What are the use-cases for wanting to check whether e.g. two unfilled circles intersect?\r\n\r\nWe could also consider adding an optarg, so you can write `r.geoCircle(..., fill: true)`.  This would also help discoverability, because someone reading the `geoCircle` docs would see the optarg (although I suppose we could mention `fill` in a prominent note in the description)."
