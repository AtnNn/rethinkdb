      "There's one open question: in the case of the compound index, how do you handle `.get_all(['chinese'])`?  The behavior you *want* is probably \"get me everything with the prefix 'chinese'\", but that isn't the current behavior of `get_all` on anything else, and it introduces other problems (what if your sub-index sometimes has one-element arrays and you want to literally get one of them?)."
