      "@mlucy \r\nImplementing geodesic geometry is made easier because S2 already provides a very comprehensive library for performing the various tests (intersection, distance, containment) and has functions that help with indexing polygons.\r\n\r\nWe would have to look for a different library or implement a lot of things ourselves if we want to support other geometry. I'm not sure how much overlap there would actually be in the implementation, though we could certainly use the same interface for such data."
