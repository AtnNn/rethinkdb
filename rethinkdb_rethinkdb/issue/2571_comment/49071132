      "@coffeemug What about the alternative of having `intersects(g)` work on streams as a rewrite rule for `filter(r.row.intersects(g))`? I'd prefer that over non-indexed `getIntersecting`.\r\n\r\nThe latter is also a bit confusing because if you specify a geo index, the intersection test is typically performed over a certain field (the field the index was built over). If you don't specify the `index` opt arg, it would apply the intersection test to the whole document."
