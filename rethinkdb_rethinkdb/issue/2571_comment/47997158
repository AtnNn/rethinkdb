      "`point.to_json.without(\"$reql_type$\")` wouldn't work, since `to_json()` returns a string doesn't it?\r\n\r\nI don't oppose to having `to_json()` do what you describe (i.e. just generate a JSON string that encodes the pseudotype object, and that can be reversed by `r.json()`). However that's not the same as converting geometry to a GeoJSON object.\r\n\r\nFurthermore it would force us to use GeoJSON for encoding our geometry pseudo-type. That's definitely something I was considering anyway, but it seems too much of an implementation detail than to tell people \"If you want to convert to GeoJSON, do `to_json()` and drop the $reql_type$ field.\""
