      "@neumino \r\n> How does `getNearest` play with compound index?\r\n\r\nI think we can make it chainable as well without much additional effort.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug \r\n> Also, I think we should have a `geoFormat` optarg, similarly to have we have `timeFormat` and friends.\r\n\r\n`timeFormat` is to tell the driver whether and how to convert the pseudo type to native types right? I actually haven't looked into whether Ruby, Python or JavaScript have native types for geometry. Does anyone know?\r\n\r\n@tracker1 I imagine this will take *roughly* two months from now."
