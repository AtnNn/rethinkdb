Marking this as settled.\r\n\r\nThe settled upon proposal is querying as described here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2571#issuecomment-47873715 (but without the `exact` flag to `getIntersecting()`) and the remaining functions as described here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2571#issuecomment-47298184\r\n\r\nI think GeoHash functionality is a separate feature."
