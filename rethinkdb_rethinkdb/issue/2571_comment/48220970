      "> I don't think we need a maximum radius (ultimately the search is limited by earth's radius of course).\r\n\r\nIn this case, `r.table(\"users\").getNearest(...).getAll(\"missingValue\")` will go through all the quadtree?\r\n\r\n> What would that include specifically?\r\n\r\nSomething to convert a geo object (point) to a geohash (and the reverse). We can throw an error if someone tries to convert a rectangle to a geohash.\r\n\r\nThe point is just to be able to pick a restaurant close to a user, and send back a url that he can share (with a geohash)."
