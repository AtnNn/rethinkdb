        "So, when we switched to lambdas we forgot to fix variable splicing in everything except Ruby.  I talked about this with Bill today.\n\nRight now you can hack around it with `let`, but when we remove that in the new spec you'll no longer be able to.  I think the solution is to just define stringification functions in Python and JS, even though it's not as pretty as in Ruby.\n"
