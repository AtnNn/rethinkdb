      "> Maybe this indicates that we should provide a way to map over the keys of an object in ReQL.\r\n\r\nI also agree that we shouldn't design the object's structure to work around ReQL's limitations and should extend ReQL instead. Note that it's just a matter of iteration but also of filtering -- see #2574 and #2990 for what we'd have to do to make names as keys work. I think we can get this done in time for the clustering release -- the implementation (and probably the discussion) is pretty easy and it's just a matter of scheduling.\r\n\r\n"
