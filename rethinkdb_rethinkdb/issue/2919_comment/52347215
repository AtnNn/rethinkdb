      "@wojons Currently we still convert queries to a protocol buffer data structure internally (in the sense that it's auto-generated from the ql2.pb file). We might replace that entirely in the future, but so far there hasn't been a strong need to do so I think.\r\nDepending on whether this issue is actually because of the space (in)efficiency of these data structures, or instead is just due to the fact that we are creating many small terms with large backtraces on the server, there might or might not be a good reason to do so now."
