      "Just tested this again and backtraces have a significant part in this, though there might be other problems as well.\r\n\r\nUsing a script that sends queries containing a 10,000 element array of very small nested documents from 100 clients concurrently (on newton, `/home/daniel/php-rql/2919-concurrent.php`), I got a memory footprint of approximately 6500-7000 MB on `next`.\r\n\r\nAfter disabling building backtraces by simply commenting all calls to `add_frames()`, it went down to approximately 4100 MB."
