        "There seems to be a fairly important element left out of protobuf_rfc_raw_spec; there's no description of the framing used to indicate the length of incoming and outgoing serialized protobuf objects.\n\nFrom inspecting the Python client, I can see that before sending a Term, a little-endian 32bit octet count should be sent.  And the same should be received before a Response object.  If this information is correct, it would be very useful to describe it in the \"high-level view\" portion of the client spec.\n"
