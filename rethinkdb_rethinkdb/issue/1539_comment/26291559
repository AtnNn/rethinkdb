      "`make unit` is actually the easiest way to run the unit tests.\r\n\r\nThere are other tests, but many of them have bitrotted (#1374). There is no point in running them until the broken ones get fixed, replaced or removed.\r\n\r\nSee `./scripts/run-tests.sh -l all` for the full list and `./scripts/run-tests.sh -h` for other options. \r\n\r\n`make test` is a simple rule that builds everything (including the drivers) and calls `./scripts/run-tests.sh -b $BUILD_DIR $TEST`"
