      "I thought the bug was because we were not removing comments in an object, but I was wrong.\r\nWe just don't save all the keys in an object. We just keep the last one to avoid having a too big representation of the query.\r\n\r\nThe bug was because we were changing the value of `start` in `extract_data_from_query` (when we shouldn't -- `start` keeps track of where we should start splitting the query).\r\n\r\nSo it was not as awful as I think it was : )\r\n\r\nReview 767 assigned to @mglukhovsky \r\n\r\nNote: Removing the comments before parsing the query doesn't work since we need the raw query to be able to rebuild the query when we add/remove suggestions."
