        "I inserted 1 million ~4 KB documents into a table. The cache-size parameter was set to 512 MB. After inserting all documents, the server used roughly 700 MB of memory, which sounds reasonable.\n\nThen I restarted the server and ran `r.table('t1').map(function(x) {return 1;}).count()` to warm up the cache. The RethinkDB process used almost 1100 MB.\n"
