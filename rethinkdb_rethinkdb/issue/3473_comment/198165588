      "From my read of things as it stands now, it seem that we already have the rethinkdb-specific flags in `RT_CXXFLAGS`, and so the only debate would be whether additional flags given through `./configure CXXFLAGS=` should be included into `CXXFLAGS` or `RT_CXXFLAGS`.\r\n\r\nSince this has come up in #2230 (build on 10.9) again, @AtnNn could you comment please? I see both pitfalls and advantages to both approaches."
