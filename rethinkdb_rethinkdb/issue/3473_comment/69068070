      "What flags would we want used in compiling RethinkDB that we would not want the libraries we are compiling not to use as well? And while it is nice that we are coving this base in `protobuf.sh` and `re2.sh` it sounds like we are only making up for the deficiency in a couple of cases, rather than doing the easier thing and getting it right in all cases.\r\n\r\nIf we do need to have separate `CXXFLAGS` for the `rethinkdb` binary only, then it seems to me that we need to make that the special case, not the default one."
