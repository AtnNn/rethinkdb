      "We decided to pass `LDFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` through to the packages, to avoid having to duplicate code that switches `-stdlib` and potentially other generic options like that in a bunch of places (the logic that does this is currently inconsistent across different places, which has caused compilation issues on some configurations).\r\n\r\nWe verified that all optimization-related flags and other compile flags that are RethinkDB-specific are already in the separate variables `RT_CXXFLAGS` and `RT_LDFLAGS`. So we should be good on that end.\r\n\r\nI also think that having flags passed through `make CXXFLAGS=...` apply to the third-party packages is ok. This is what I personally expected, though I'm sure there are different ways to think about this. Ultimately I think it doesn't matter too much, since you can still specify `RT_CXXFLAGS` instead once you know about it."
