      "This was by design.\r\n\r\n* Variables passed to the `configure` script were used for building RethinkDB only (`./configure CXXFLAGS=-DARWIN; make`)\r\n* Variables in the environment were used for building both RethinkDB and the libraries in `external/` (`export CXXFLAGS=-DARWIN; ./configure; make`)\r\n\r\nThis allowed passing build options specific to RethinkDB, which is a very common use case of the build system.\r\n\r\nThe `configure` script adds `-stdlib=libc++` on OS X to work around the outdated `libstdc++` that is the default on older systems. It looks like this hack is duplicated in `protobuf.sh` and `re2.sh`."
