        "@Tryneus, I believe you wrote the python stress client mainly for the X workload, but I've been using it for other things, such as replacing the C++ stress client.\r\n\r\n* The python stress client does not stop until it gets killed.\r\n\r\nI have been experimenting with two command-line flags, `--duration` to stop after a given number of seconds, and `--op-count` to stop after a given number of operations.\r\n\r\n* It limits the number of operations per second, which doesn't fully stress the server.\r\n\r\nI modified it to not limit the number of operations per second when given the `--ops-per-sec 0` arguments.\r\n\r\n* Arguments cannot be passed directly to the workload. The X workloads look for their arguments in environment variables.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the stress script is an executable which imports the workload secified by the `--workload` argument, which is a python module. I think it would work better if each workload was a separate executable and the stress script was turned into module that would be imported by each workload.\r\n\r\n* The C++ stress client has many other options and flags not supported by the python stress client.\r\n\r\nBecause it only supports memcache, we've talked about removing the C++ stress client. (@timmaxw you had some reservations about this. Do you remember what they were?)\r\n\r\nMost of the options that the C++ stress client supports are not used by any of the scripts in test. Does anyone have a use case that requires one of these options?\r\n\r\n```\r\n        --client-suffix\r\n                Append a per-client id to key names.\r\n        --ignore-protocol-errors\r\n                Do not quit if the protocol throws errors.\r\n        -w, --workload\r\n                Target load to generate.
