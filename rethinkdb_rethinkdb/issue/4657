        "I found that there were some issues with the endings on error messages with them sometime ending in `.` and sometime ending in `:`. This turned out to be a lot to work out, but not so many changes in the test infrastructure. The one exception is that the ruby test \"driver\" needed a bit of modification as it was missing mis-matches on error messages.\r\n\r\nThis is already done, and this is mostly for tracking purposes. This does bring a few bugs to light that will need to be filed (tomorrow probably)."
