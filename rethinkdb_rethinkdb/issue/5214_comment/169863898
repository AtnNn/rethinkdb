      "I ended up making a slightly smaller change, which is that throwing an exception from inside a RethinkDB Handler stops the handler.  This produces good behavior in the simplest case and was an extremely small change.  it's in CR 3415 by @Tryneus .  We should consider fixing this further in the future (making it so that an exception thrown from a handler wins over the \"Connection Closed\" exceptions from *all* handlers rather than just from itself)."
