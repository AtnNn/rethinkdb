Is that correct? Is this even working? I've noticed that the web UI will let you put basically anything in the text field for the index key name. Doing the following even works:\r\n\r\n````\r\n{ \"quote\": [ \"price\" ] }\r\n````\r\n\r\nWhat is the correct way to reference child objects when creating secondary indexes in the web UI?"
