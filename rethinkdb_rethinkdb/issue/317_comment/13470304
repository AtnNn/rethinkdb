      "This issue is mostly for @mlucy's benefit but since you ask...\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `between` currently doesn't preserve the selection property, i.e. this doesn't work:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntable.between(low, high).delete().run(c) => RuntimeError \"Could not convert Sequence to Selection\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe tie back to the original table is lost. The problem is in the way between is currently implement (with a sort rather than a range get). We shouldn't forget to fix this before 1.4 or we'll not be able to delete only part of a table (without constructing point deletes for each row we want to delete). This also applies to replace and update."
