      "Since the homebrew folks don't like the make-time node dependency, it spawned a couple of questions for me:\r\n\r\n1. The brew formula should really depend on coffeescript, less, and handlebars for the next branch. We could presumably take out direct node dependency, correct?\r\n2. The brew formula as well as the top-level rethinkdb makefile for osx uses `BUILD_PORTABLE=1 STATIC=1 FETCH_INTERNAL_TOOLS=1`. I'm not sure we need these flags at all -- they're used to build on 10.04 which doesn't have the proper node tools available, the right version of v8 (which we then grab ourselves and link to statically), etc. I don't believe we need that on OS X at all. @srh, @atnnn -- are you sure we need these build options? EDIT: on second thought we might need that to statically link V8 since there may not be a binary compatibility for v8 versions across osx versions."
