      "@atnnn -- are you certain that it will do what you expect wrt v8? Standard v8 packages don't come with static libs, so we had to build them ourselves if we wanted to link v8 statically. The reason why we wanted to link v8 statically for portable package, is that the binary API changed across versions of linux, and 10.04 had an API so old we couldn't even compile against v8 (so we had to fetch the latest version ourselves).\r\n\r\nAre you sure that if you link against v8 dynamically on an older osx platform it will work on a newer one? (I don't believe static=1 is sufficient to link v8 statically)."
