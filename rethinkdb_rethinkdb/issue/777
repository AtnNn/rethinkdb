        "I'm running @mlucy's migration script (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/scripts/migration/import_export.rb) to export data from rethinkdb 1.4 format into next. The data has about four thousand relatively large documents (this is president beef's workload).\r\n\r\nI tried to import the dataset twice, and every time it hangs before completion. When I ctrl-c the ruby migration script, I get the following backtrace (I've reproduced this twice):\r\n\r\n```\r\n./import_export.rb:3563:in `wait': Interrupt\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:3563:in `wait'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:3562:in `synchronize'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:3562:in `wait'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:3521:in `run_internal'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:3536:in `run'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:3449:in `run'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4228:in `insert_rows'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4277:in `import'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4274:in `each_line'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4274:in `import'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4272:in `open'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4272:in `import'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4267:in `each'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4267:in `import'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4263:in `chdir'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4263:in `import'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4262:in `each'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4262:in `import'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4260:in `chdir'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4260:in `import'\r\n\tfrom ./import_export.rb:4379\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy the time the hang happens, both server and client CPU usage drops near zero, however the server responds to read queries through the data explorer just fine (so I'm not sure what the cause of the hang is).\r\n\r\nI can share the data to reproduce, but I'm wondering if any insight can be gleamed from the stack trace first.\r\n\r\nP.S. this is on OS X."
