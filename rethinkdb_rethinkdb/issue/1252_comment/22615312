      "Ok, this is implemented and merged into next (commits ed2c3c0 and c6f61a0), and cherry-picked into v1.8.x (commits 3286f6c and c0b1621), following an OTS review by Slava.  Will be in release 1.8.0.\r\n\r\nA few tangentially related problems were encountered and fixed while working on this issue, namely:\r\n* JSON `import` now buffers in chunks of 32KB rather than 8MB (performance tweaking)\r\n* Fixed a rather major problem where JSON `import` would occasionally error on a valid JSON array, due to buffering\r\n* Interruption of `import` should be less spammy\r\n* Fixed a race condition crash when interrupting `import`\r\n* When an error occurs while inserting data, the error message now includes the `db.table`"
