      "I don't think this is actually a bug. I observed this test performing 414 concurrent backfills which on a rotational drive is expected to take a really long time. If anything this is a non critical performance issue. But honestly I'm not sure how much faster we can expect to make this. Doing 414 concurrent backfills is going to take a while on a rotational drive since it's basically just random disk reads and writes."
