      "Actually the first thing to do is probably to test this with something other than the PHP driver.\r\nIt uses 60-90% CPU during this test, so that's definitely a hot candidate for where the slowness is coming from.\r\n\r\n@gotlium's original test in #3245 was using the Go driver I think, or it might have been the Python driver (it's a bit unclear)."
