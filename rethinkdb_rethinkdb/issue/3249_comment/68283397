      "Thanks for sharing your measurements @kofalt.\r\nThe web UI is generally especially slow in parsing query responses, which I think is independent of the server and protocol.\r\nIt would be nice if we could carve off some of the latency for the more efficient clients, such as the Go driver you've tested.\r\n\r\nI don't know if the TCP stack is part of the problem here or not. We first need to benchmark this more."
