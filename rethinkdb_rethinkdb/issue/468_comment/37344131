      "A connection issue happens at runtime (unlike a syntax error written in some static code). I'm not sure what runtime actually means.\r\n\r\nThrowing a `RqlDriverError` when the connection fails is a little obscure. It could mean anything from a memory allocation failure in some C library, to an issue in parsing the protobuf received from the server.\r\n\r\nHow about `RqlConnectionError` ? (with the inner exception set to the original one, and its message set to `\"#{inner_exception.class} #{inner_exception.message}\"`).\r\n\r\nAlso, an `RqlConnectionError` may happen whenever the user is trying to access the database, any read or write queries, not just `r.connect`."
