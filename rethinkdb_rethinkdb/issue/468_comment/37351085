      "Also, it would be useful to document and stabilize the error that the database could throw.\r\nMaybe some error codes (provided constants) would be useful for the `RqlRuntimeError` exception. At the moment, NoBrainer relies on the following responses:\r\n```ruby\r\n/^Index `(.+)` was not found\\.$/\r\n/^Database `(.+)` does not exist\\.$/\r\n/Database `(.+)` already exists/\r\n/^Table `(.+)` does not exist\\.$/\r\n/Table `(.+)` already exists/\r\n/cannot perform (read|write): No master available/\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we knew in advance what to expect."
