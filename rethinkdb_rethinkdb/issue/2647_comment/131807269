      "To keep it simple, how about just storing the files where they are most at home, in the OS file system but storing meta-data for them in a RethinkDB system table so that from ReQL it feels like they are inside the database? \r\n\r\nFor replication, a separate file watcher micro-process launched by RethinkDB on start-up could perhaps keep the metadata in sync as well as copy new/modified files across to peer servers (maybe with compression, except for image, audio and video file types). \r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be too hard to find an existing library to efficiently sync file changes between servers. The rsync protocol comes to mind. \r\n\r\nSorry, just thinking out loud... :)\r\n"
