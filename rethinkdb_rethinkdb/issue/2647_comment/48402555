      "@coffeemug -- this has missed the window for ReQL discussion pretty thoroughly at this point.  I don't think we're close to being able to mark it settled, and I don't want to extend the discussion period another week since everything else is in a good place.\r\n\r\nSince everyone has work to do, could we move this to polish and come back to it?"
