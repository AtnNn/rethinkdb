      "There are a few things missing:\r\n\r\n- Commands available on the pseudotype. For example, reading from the middle of a file, writing to the middle of a file, appending to a file. We also need those for streaming to work on the client.\r\n- How do I query files by metadata?\r\n- We should allow the user to optionally set chunk size on a file.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think we should consider exposing the file system via a namespace/object to make the API more accessible:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfs = RethinkFS(conn, db=media, table=videos)\r\nfile = fs.open('name', 'w+') # note, no .run()\r\nfile.write(r.binary(...))\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe whole thing is still wonky. What if we settled the API for everything else so everyone can start working on the next batch of features (I think we're basically there and can do it tomorrow), and then come back to this proposal when #2612 is done?"
