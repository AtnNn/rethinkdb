For possible values of parameters use the same color as in the DE (red)\r\n\r\n3. Add sort of a section title for the API description.\r\n\r\n4. Change \"Ex\" to \"Example\" and make it have the style as the API description section.\r\n\r\n5. Use a fixed font for the code snippets. Add a bit of spacing between the example description and the code snippet.\r\n\r\n6. Present by default a single example. If there are more in the API docs, add either a \"See more examples on API page\" link or allow expanding the popup\r\n\r\n![DataExplorerSuggester](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/290841/344954/ba8e0268-9e10-11e2-985e-406fbe5a082f.png)\r\n"
