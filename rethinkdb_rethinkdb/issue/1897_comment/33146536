      "Just a quick update - I disabled IPv6 on this particular server and that seems to have fixed things.  Because this is a machine I'm trying to deploy a beta codebase to (and I'm already weeks late), I can't realistically muck around to see if I can reproduce it.\r\n\r\nIf I have time next week, I'll setup a new temp server to see if I can reproduce the problem.  \r\n\r\nJust as a side note - `lsof -ni` show the same lack of port binding.   I did a quick search on `netstat` problems and it seems there are some issues related to kernel interfaces, but nothing in the last 5 years or so..."
