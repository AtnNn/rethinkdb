      "@Tryneus Yes, I believe that some ports were available but not others.  If you look at the `netstat` output above, there is something strange going on as the `tcp6` addresses for `8080` are not in fact `tcp6` address strings.  Also, the problem that caused me to investigate this was a connection error.  I don't remember the exact error, but it was clearly a `connection refused`-type error and I went down the usual road (db running, firewall open, correct host, etc).  That's when I stumbled on the `netstat` output above suggesting Rethink was not binding to the port....\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can duplicate tomorrow.  Regardless, it definitely looks like something is seriously wrong with `netstat` or whatever it's looking at for data, cf. IPv4 addresses labeled as tcp6."
