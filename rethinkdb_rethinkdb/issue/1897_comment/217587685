      "Hi,\r\n@danielmewes yes you are right, my problem was iptables, i dont know why, but this time was iptables blocked the 8080. Last month i installer another rethinkdb cluster on centos 7 minimal install and I didn't had any trouble with iptables, but this time i had. Probably because last install configure the firewall exception and this new version don't. \r\n\r\nThank for your response.\r\n\r\nSergio "
