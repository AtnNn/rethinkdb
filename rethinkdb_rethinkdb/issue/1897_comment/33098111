      "A couple things:\r\n\r\nFirst, when `bind=all` is specified, we do one bind per port using `in6addr_any`, which should also listen on IPv4 addresses.  It would appear that it is possible that this will not happen if there is a system parameter set to disable this behavior, `net.inet6.ip6.v6only=1`, though I haven't tested it.  We could change it to explicitly bind to addresses from both address families, it should only be a one line change IIRC.\r\n\r\nSecondly, @coffeemug, it is intended behavior that we listen on loopback addresses in all cases, this was discussed when it was implemented.\r\n\r\n@ckmaresca, are you saying that some of the ports are available on IPv4 when using `bind=all`, but others are not?"
