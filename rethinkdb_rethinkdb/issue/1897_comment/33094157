      "Just tried it with the config file instead of command line on 13.10 -- it works as expected.\r\n\r\nWould you mind posting the actual output of `ip a` and `rethinkdb --bind all --port-offset 5`? (added the port offset so it doesn't conflict with the running instance) We might notice something there that isn't immediately obvious."
