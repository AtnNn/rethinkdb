      "I like the idea of binding both the sequence and the post.\r\nThat would actually make bi-directional relation work with multi indexes.\r\n\r\nI'm a little less fan of having to call `merge` inside the compose function though. It means that you must find about merge to do a join, and one point of the new `join` should be to make things simpler.\r\n\r\nI would first provide the sequence, then the parent document too (so `function(comments, post)` in the example -- but that's probably because I would like to avoid the user to call `post.merge(...)`."
