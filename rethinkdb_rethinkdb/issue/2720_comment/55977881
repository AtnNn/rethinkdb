      "> Why?  It means less work to do on the server, but it just means more work for all our users.\r\n\r\nI think the number of users who would learn about and use those flags is small.  It's also easy to add those flags later if people complain -- they won't affect the rest of the implementation.  When I'm unsure about adding something, and it's easy to add later, I usually default to not adding it."
