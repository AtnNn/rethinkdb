      "It's actually an interesting question whether an extended join command would be any faster than the options from #4566 with `filter` + `get` and/or loading one side into an object first. Internally, a join would be implemented pretty similarly to the `filter`.\r\n\r\nWe should probably revisit that part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2156 in combination with this, to make sure that joins are parallelized sufficiently (though similar parallelization could also be applied to `filter`, so I think there's no deeper reason for why the join would be any faster than the filter)."
