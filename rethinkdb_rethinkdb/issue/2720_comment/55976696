      "> what do you think of enforce_one/enforce_max\r\n\r\nI would just skip those.\r\n\r\n> In case multi is set to true, what do we do if the field isn't an array but is a single ID? What do we do in this case in case of concatMap/multi-indexes?\r\n\r\nCurrently in multi-indexes if the field is a single ID rather than an array we look up that ID (as if it were an array of one element).  This is bad for all the obvious reasons, but I think we should do the same thing here for consistency."
