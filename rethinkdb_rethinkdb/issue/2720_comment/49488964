      "> Could we have `include_missing` default to `true` since `group` defaults to `true`?\r\n\r\nThat sounds like a good idea.\r\n\r\n> If there are more than one document, we can throw an error.\r\n\r\nSo I guess we should expand the spec. If `group` is `true`, then if the user doesn't specify an index to the join (and therefore use the primary key from the right table), the joined field should include a single document, not an array. If they specify an index (and therefore use `get_all`), the joined field should include an array.\r\n\r\nWe can add an optarg `enforce_one` or a more general one `enforce_max` or something like that. I don't really like that because it seems overly specific to me, but I'm not entirely opposed to it."
