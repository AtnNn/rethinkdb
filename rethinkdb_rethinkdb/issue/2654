        "We should replace zip_datum_stream_t with a transformer function, so that it can get pushed to the shards.  This also means that a `blah.join(...).zip().map(...)` would result in the map getting pushed to the shards, which is generally a good thing (if the join gets pushed to the shards).  Pushing the work of the zip operation to the shards is also a good way to distribute the computational effort of the zip operation itself.  @mlucy and I both agree that this is how things should be.  I don't feel a great sense of urgency about doing this, it seems like the effort needed for this change would be minimal."
