        "- Clicking on the documentation box closes it. This prohibits from clicking any links (such as in the documentation for `r.match`) or from copying the documentation. I suggest making links work, and adding a link to the docs page for that command on rethinkdb.com.\n- Clicking in a command from the autocomplete list hides the documentation for that command. I suggest leaving the documentation visible as if the command and parenthesis had been typed.\n\nI have only tested with firefox 24.\n"
