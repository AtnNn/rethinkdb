        "There has been a lot of outdated discussion in #2678 and #2677, so I wanted to close those and cover the new proposal in this issue.\n\nI propose the following API. I think the settings should be per table (as they are now), stored in `table_config` as follows:\n\n``` py\n{\n  ...\n  'durability': {\n    'wait_on_disks': True,\n    'wait_on_replicas': 'majority',\n    'acknowledgement_replicas': ['m1', 'm2']\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nThe user can set `wait_on_disk` to `True` (default) or `False`. If set to `True`, replicas will be expected to only acknowledge the write when it's been committed to disk. If set to `False`, replicas can acknowledge the write once it's saved in memory, but do not have to wait on an ack from disk.\n\nThe user can set `wait_on_replicas` to `'majority'` (default) or `'one'`. When set to `'majority'` the server will acknowledge the write only when `N / 2 + 1` replicas acknowledge the write. When set to `'one'` the server will acknowledge the write when at least one of the replicas acknowledges the write (realistically, the primary replica).\n\nThe user can set `acknowledgement_replicas` to an array of servers (defaults to `None`), in which case `wait_on_replicas` will only wait on acks from those replicas, but not others when set to `majority`. (Note, how the array is represented will depend on what we decide to do with ids in `table_config`).\n\n@timmaxw @neumino -- feedback?\n"
