        "Like part of the issue in #2998 the connections/connection.js test is hard coded to use port 11221 which it assumes is not in use. Unfortunately this assumption can sometimes be incorrect (as it is right now). It should be changed to find an open port, and then test with it. A small race condition where something else could pick up the port it acceptable.\n"
