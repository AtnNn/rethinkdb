      "If you look at the network connections that the web UI uses in your browser, you can see a request that looks like this:\r\n`open-new-connection?cacheBuster=...`\r\n\r\nThe server responds to this with a connection token.\r\n\r\nThen, in order to actually do anything, you have to pass that connection token (`conn_id`) to the subsequent calls (e.g. `?conn_id=...`). If the ID doesn't match up, the query isn't executed.\r\n\r\nAn attacker could perform a DoS attack on the server, by opening a large number of connections through `open-new-connection` which would consume memory on the RethinkDB server until the connections eventually time out. But they shouldn't be able to run queries."
