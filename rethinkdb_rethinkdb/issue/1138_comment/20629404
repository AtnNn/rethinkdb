      "CLA is signed.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of python3 compatibility. I found that migration scripts require python2. It would be really great to make it python3 compatible as well. Python3 is the next version, more and more distros make it default version. I suspect those scripts should be easy migrate to python3. Could anyone look at it?"
