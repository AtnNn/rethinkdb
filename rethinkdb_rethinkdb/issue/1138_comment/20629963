      "@anatol -- do you mean rethinkdb dump/restore scripts? Those depend on the python driver, which unfortunately depends on the protobuf library. So it's not much use to make them Python 3 compatible until we can sort out the protobuf issue on Python 3.\r\n\r\nThis is becoming more of a problem, so we'll try to schedule some time to solve this in the near future."
