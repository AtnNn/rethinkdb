        "I was running a test involving 6 servers and a test table with one shard and active traffic running to it (writes, updates, and non-atomic updates).  Once some data was put into the table, I resharded it to six shards.  Backfilling occurred, judging by the graph, but afterwards traffic never resumed.  When I shut down the cluster, server 0 (where the initial shard had been hosted) was hanging.\n\nAttaching to it with gdb, I observed the following coroutines were active:\nthreads 0, 1, 2, and 3 each had an instance of:\n`registrar_t::on_create()` waiting for the deletion notification\n\nThread 0 had all remaining coroutines:\n20 `reactor_be_nothing::be_nothing()`\n4 `reactor_be_primary::be_primary()`\n1 `namespace_interface_t::relationship_t::~relationship_t()` most likely blocked on its auto_drainer_t\nAnd a few other coroutines that I don't believe are of any consequence\n\nThe coroutine that I believe was holding everything up was the following:\n`multi_throttling_client_t<read_request_t>::spawn_request()` most likely waiting to acquire a ticket\n\nThe server remained in this state for a while, but eventually shut down.  This is therefore not a full deadlock, but it obviously affects availability if we cannot run traffic until the problem sorts itself out.\n"
