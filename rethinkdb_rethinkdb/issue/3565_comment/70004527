      "A more extreme solution would be to detect low memory conditions and shut ourselves down rather than opening an issue.  This would obviously mean that RethinkDB would sometimes shut down when it doesn't have to, but depending on how close we can skirt the actual limit I think it isn't that big a deal.  If we could reliably shut down whenever we get within 5% of the memory usage that would trigger the OOM killer, we could make this problem go away and only inconvenience people who are already in a dangerous situation with regard to memory usage."
