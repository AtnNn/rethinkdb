      "I think we shouldn't over-think this for now. I believe the most important part is that we write something to the log.\r\nA couple of users have had their servers crashing, checked the RethinkDB log, and didn't find any sort of information in there. Showing an issue in the issues table / web UI is a useful bonus.\r\n\r\nWe could consider shutting down the server so that soft durability writes don't get lost, but to be honest it feels a bit too \"smart\" and risky to me. I myself at least wouldn't feel confident enough in our free memory detection to shut down peoples' servers. If you look at /proc/vmstat on a Linux machine there's loads of stuff there. Unless we understand very well how these numbers work and what their effects are on running out of memory I think we shouldn't do it."
