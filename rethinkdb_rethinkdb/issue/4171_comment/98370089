      "Maybe this is a radical idea, but could we allow people to download add-on modules, that would basically be separate Docker containers with Python, Ruby, Java, etc., and use those to execute language-specific ReQL?\r\n\r\nI'm not clear on how secure Docker containers are, but as I understand it, as long as the host filesystem isn't shared with the container, and a non-root user runs the VM, there should be sufficient isolation."
