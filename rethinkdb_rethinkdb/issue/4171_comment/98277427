      "I think @deontologician is right, `r.js` doesn't allow i/o.\r\n\r\nI think there's a difference between being able to trash the database and being able to read all files of the user running RethinkDB, or even being able to rooting the box as soon as there's some kernel or other privilege escalation around, which isn't all that uncommon.\r\n\r\nThere are probably ways to significantly restrict the privileges of a given process on the major operating systems (something like selinux maybe?). It might become a pain to maintain and port though.\r\n\r\nIf we can find a Python parser that runs in the browser, I think that might be a better option.\r\n(*Edit:* Just saw @deontologician had already found one)"
