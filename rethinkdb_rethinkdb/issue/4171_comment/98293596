      "I don't know. It seems like a very different class of security problem to me.\r\nHaving an accidental `--bind all` giving full access over your box to everyone on the Internet seems worse than just giving them access to your database. You might even willingly accept the latter for a test or development database, and getting the former as a side effect would be really unexpected in my opinion."
