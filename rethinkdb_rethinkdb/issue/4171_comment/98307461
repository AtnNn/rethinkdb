      "This might be a cultural thing; in my mind databases usually live on their own boxes, and you're usually worried about someone breaking into the box to get access to the database rather than someone breaking into the database to get access to the box.\r\n\r\nIf it seems like a major security concern then I agree we probably shouldn't do it.  Parsing Python/Ruby in the data explorer probably isn't that much harder."
