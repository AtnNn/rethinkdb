      "`r.js` is what I was referring to.  I don't think security is an issue here because if someone has the ability to run arbitrary queries from your web UI you're already pretty much screwed, but if we did want to lock it down more we could spawn the Python interpreter in a separate process owned by a user with no useful permissions (or if you wanted to be exceptionally paranoid, in a lightweight jail)."
