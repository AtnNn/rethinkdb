      "Here is another example. Attribute lookup can fail on an object other than r.row:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> r.expr({'a': -1}).do(lambda x: r.expr([1,3,2]).order_by(lambda row: row * x['b'])).run()\r\n[1, 3, 2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSilently ignoring errors makes ReQL very hard to debug. It is especially hard in cases like this, where it seems like the query actually works, but the results are wrong."
