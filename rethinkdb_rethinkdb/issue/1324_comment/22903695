      "This is the expected behavior right now.  The idea is that people frequently want to order a table by several attributes, some of which might not be defined, like:\r\n```ruby\r\ntbl.orderby('first_name', 'middle_name', 'last_name') # some people don't have a middle name\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe also want these to be equivalent just for sanity's sake:\r\n```ruby\r\ntbl.orderby('a')\r\ntbl.ordrby{|row| row['a']}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe combination of those two behaviors leads to this behavior."
