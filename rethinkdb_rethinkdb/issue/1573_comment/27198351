      "I would prefer not to allocate time to this issue until 2.0 is out (sorry @Anorov!) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* It's less important than some of the other performance/stability work we're doing\r\n* There is a relatively straightforward workaround (http://rethinkdb.com/docs/data-modeling/)\r\n* Array speed has philosophical implications (e.g. #971, general data modeling questions in Rethink), and I think we should take the time to discuss it together.\r\n\r\nMoving to backlog."
