      "@Anorov -- we are in fact creating a whole new array every time you append to it.  The original idea was that short lists should be stored in arrays, and large lists should be stored in tables.  It turns out that in practice lots of people really want better support for large arrays, though, so at some point we're going to rework things so that (most) updates to arrays and objects don't require copying.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there's not much you can do on your end to speed this up, unless you want to switch to using a table instead of an array for that list."
