      "I think we should break functions in-between releases until we get to the LTS release (at which point we should freeze).  We don't want people using the old, bad APIs, and we don't want the maintenance burden that comes from having multiple ways to do everything.\r\n\r\nI think it's more important that we get to a truly stable release as fast as possible than that we spend time maintaining deprecated features in-between beta releases (or whatever we call our current release status)."
