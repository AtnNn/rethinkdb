      "@mlucy: I'm not really sure why small batches are so much less efficient.\r\nIf I ask the server to send me a batch of something like 30-40 documents (e.g. from the between query), the time for sending the request and receiving the response is about 0.8 ms per document (the whole batch takes ~24-32 ms accordingly).\r\nIf on the other hand I use the default batch configuration and get batches of 5-7 documents, the time per document is around 1.2 ms (6-8 ms latency for getting the batch).\r\n\r\nWhat I find a bit odd is that the batch size varies a lot. A lot of the batches in the between query with the default batch size have 5 to 7 documents, but some have 3 and others have 14. If I understand correctly, the max_dur default is 500ms, so that doesn't seem to be hit here. The document size is the same for all documents in the table. @mlucy: Is it expected to get different batch sizes like that?"
