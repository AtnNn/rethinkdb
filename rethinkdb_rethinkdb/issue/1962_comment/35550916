      "@mlucy: I have to check the batch sizes for a simple `r.table()`. The numbers above where for `r.table().between()`.\r\nEach document has exactly the same size, and the latency cap doesn't seem to be hit. Unless I misunderstand how it works. A batch never gets even close to taking 500ms, which seems to be the default for the latency cap?"
