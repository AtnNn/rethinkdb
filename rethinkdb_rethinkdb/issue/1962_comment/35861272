      "@danielmewes -- after working with you I've come to realize that ability to plot data on a whim is a mystical superpower, much like ability to consistently exercise, or to not overeat, or to stop refreshing Hacker News.\r\n\r\nYes, I *could* use gnuplot, or (heavens forbid) Excel, but empirically, I just don't. That you do it with such finesse is a faculty worth celebrating.\r\n\r\nI want your powers. Mark my words, we'll get plotting into the web ui in 2014!\r\n\r\n"
