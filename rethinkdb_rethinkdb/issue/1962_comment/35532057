      "@danielmewes -- I fiddled with the batch size until the latency and throughput felt right.  So, basically I made it up.\r\n\r\nI would at least measure the latency in both cases before switching it back.\r\n\r\n(Also, do we know why using 1/4 MB is so much slower?  Theoretically it should be close to as fast, since we do prefetching and I think the overhead per batch should be small compared to 250KB.)"
