      "So the reason these weren't made to be selections originally is that they require aggregating the data on a central node first. They behave fundamentally differently than our other selections. Basically it was trade off between glossing over a potentially treacherous detail (non atomicity) and extra typing. I think it's probably fine to switch to the glossed over version since at this point we actually do the same thing with all range operations (we don't have to but we do). But I'm not 100% percent sure. Whoever fixes this should first take a while to think about that because it's easy to mess this sort of thing up."
