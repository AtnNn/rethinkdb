      "Just to chime in on the delete: a further alternative to delete a selection based on limits would be (python):\r\n\r\n    r.table(\"foo\").filter(lambda x: \r\n        r.table(\"foo\")\r\n\t\t\t.order_by(\"id\")\r\n\t\t\t.limit(1)[\"id\"]\r\n\t\t\t.contains(x[\"id\"])\r\n\t\t).delete().run()\r\n\r\nI have two concerns with implementing this: \r\n1. As a driver author it adds additional complexity\r\n2. As a user, I now have even more choices for how to do something, which may confuse me when I see others doing the same thing in a different way. There is such a thing as too many ways of doing something, and I think that it may be beneficial to stick to a single, solid way of deleting a selection, no matter where it comes from. \r\n\r\nBesides, not implementing this does not preclude the drivers from providing a simpler, more convenient syntax to achieve the same results. Make the RQL as simple as possible, and make the drivers as convenient as possible, which do all the heavy lifting to translate to the required RQL."
