      "It's pretty funny, Wikipedia's [interval page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)) writes  `R = (-\8734, +\8734)` but the French also uses this notation  `]-\8734, +\8734[` (which is more common in France).\r\n\r\nAnyway, while it's not the most important issue, it's still a valid one.\r\nI have no objection to @jamescostian's suggestion,\r\n\r\n\r\nPutting in backlog, I'll do it when I'll have a few minutes.\r\nThanks @jamescostian for reporting it."
