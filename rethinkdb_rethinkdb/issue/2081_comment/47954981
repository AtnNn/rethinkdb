      "The interval notation is used in a tooltip for the graph showing shards.\r\nThe `-\8734 to 915b1cc8...` feels a little better in the \"Data on this server\" view. It makes the data nicer to read (it looks like a sentence - even though it's not really).\r\n\r\nI'm not strongly opposed of doing it though."
