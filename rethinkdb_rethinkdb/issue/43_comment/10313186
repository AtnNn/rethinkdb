      "I think the behavior is correct as is. The server always behaves consistently -- if the query tries to evaluate an attribute and the attribute doesn't exist, it throws an error. If the query doesn't need to evaluate the attribute, the server proceeds as planned. In case of `without`, the value of the attribute isn't evaluated, so the error isn't thrown. Similarly, in case of run, the server evaluates the row, not the attribute, so everything works as expected as well.\r\n\r\nAs far as making dealing with these errors easier on the user, I agree with @jdoliner -- we'll address it via #27."
