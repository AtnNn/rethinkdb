      "I'd say without should error here.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that we should error by default and offer people a way to have it not error if it's not found. Maybe we'd also want a way to have a default value for the plucks. I prefer this because compensating for missing parameters winds up being a big pain since it comes up in so many places and I don't think it's good to make people learn different rules for each case. Better to just consistently error if a parameter is missing and give people ways to have default values."
