      "I think it was @danielmewes who mentioned to me that someone had suggested using the `squash` value as a way of determining how often the values were polled for. That would be very helpful for me in testing since I am often looking for short-lived items in various artificial tables, and currently have to resort to polling to increase the chances that I see them."
