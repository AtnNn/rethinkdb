      "I don't think we should try doing anything \"smart\". Arrays and streams need to be handled sufficiently differently in ReQL, that automatically switching from one to the other will only be confusing.\r\n\r\nI really like the fact that `r.range` is a stream, but I think I'd be ok with changing it to an array by default and having an optarg for making it a stream again.\r\nI'm not sure if I would prefer an unbounded `r.range` without the `stream` optarg to fail, or to switch to the stream return type automatically."
