      "One thing to do would be to make `r.range` with a finite argument be an array by default, but add an optarg to produce a stream.  That way the person who wants to write `r.range(200000)` (which is fairly rare) would be the one who has to do the extra typing, rather than the person who wants to get an array back, which I think is far more frequent."
