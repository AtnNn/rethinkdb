        "Fixes #4780. Unfortunately, there was no way to implement this as an overload to the existing `cursor.each()` since there's no way to disambiguate the argument style.\n\nHere's some example usage:\n\n``` js\ncursor.eachAsync(function (row) {\n  if (/* some condition */) {\n    // if you return a promise, it will be awaited\n    // before the cursor continues iteration\n    return asyncRowHandler(row.id);\n  }\n  else {\n    // iteration can be stopped early by returning a\n    // promise that is later rejected or simply by throw'ing\n    return Promise.reject('Stop iteration early.')\n  }\n})\n.then(function () {\n  // `cursor.eachAsync()` returns a promise that is resolved\n  // once all rows have been read from the cursor\n});\n```\n"
