      "Alright, I've beaten on limit changefeeds pretty badly.  I'm going to run some sharded tests overnight, and then we should be mostly good.  As usual I didn't get through the whole list, but I think we'll live.\r\n\r\nHere's what I'd still like to get done:\r\n* [x] `min`/`max` -- these can just be in polyglot tests, since their edge cases are basically identical to `.orderby.limit(1)` which we do test.\r\n* [x] Errors -- I think Karl has some of these in tests already, and it would be easy to add `.orderby.limit` to those.  I'll talk to him about it tomorrow.\r\n* [ ] Testing lots of changefeeds being open at once with a simple workload (i.e. removing the cross-product requirement for that test).\r\n\r\nThe rest of the stuff I'm OK pushing off or doing after the freeze."
