        "Can someone explain how RethinkDB handles the case of many clients requesting change feeds with the same query? A chatroom is the canonical example I'm thinking of.\n\nIs it more efficient on the DB server to only send one request and handle subscriptions at the app level? Or does the DB server dedupe these and efficiently dispatch the same values to all of them without doing calculations for each one?\n\nI'm ignoring the bandwidth and transferring steps in this analysis, although they are important also.\n"
