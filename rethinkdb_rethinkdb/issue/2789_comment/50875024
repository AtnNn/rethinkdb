      "I'm going to take the changes that were made in `sam_2774_disk_structure` (which are in `next` now) and adapt them to also cover secondary index key serialization.  I will do this in `sam_2789_disk_structure`.  Then I will create a branch `sam_2789_keyfix` from that, making the changes in `grey_binary_sindex` apply to new sindexes.  This will let people continue using their broken secondary indexes.\r\n\r\nWe then need an appropriate way to tell users to rebuild their secondary indexes and give them something that makes it easy for them."
