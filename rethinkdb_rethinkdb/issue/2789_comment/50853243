      "Also, what are we doing for the secondary index key representation now?\r\n\r\nI mentioned in another issue (#2699) that I thought we'd have trouble with having null bytes in strings, thanks to null bytes being used as separators in the secondary index keys.\r\n\r\nNow is a good time to remove that restriction.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm looking at the code right now and I don't think it's treating binary keys right either.  But wait that's in review.\r\n\r\nstr_to_str_key should do the same thing for nul characters as binary_to_str_key does in code review 1837 (I don't know what branch it's in because @tryneus didn't say so in the review!) so that we don't have to rebuild secondary indexes."
