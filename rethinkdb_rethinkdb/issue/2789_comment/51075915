      "> I think the question of how we store something internally is completely separate from how we present it to the user.\r\n\r\nWe present time values to the user as time objects.\r\n\r\nWe present binary values to the user as binary objects.\r\n\r\nWe don't use JSON for anything and we are not a JSON store.  That is a lie."
