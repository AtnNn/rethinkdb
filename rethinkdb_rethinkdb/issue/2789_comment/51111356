      "The work in `sam_2789_keyfix` is done and it currently has the latest visible version of `grey_binary_sindex` merged into it.\r\n\r\nThis means that the code for running old secondary indexes with the old behavior is implemented.  Actual in-place upgrading needs to be tested though, so this might be a premature announcement."
