      "> We present time values to the user as time objects.\r\n\r\n> We present binary values to the user as binary objects.\r\n\r\nWe present them as pseudotypes, which have a native representation **and** a JSON representation that you can access with the `format` optargs.\r\n\r\n> We don't use JSON for anything and we are not a JSON store. That is a lie.\r\n\r\nWe call ourselves a JSON data store, and people think of us that way.  (See e.g. http://rethinkdb.com/docs/comparison-tables/ .)\r\n\r\nWe use JSON for several things (e.g. `r.json`, communicating with v8).  More importantly, we currently have the property that every row in RethinkDB has a rereadable JSON representation.\r\n\r\nPseudotypes are how we reconcile our desire to have a rereadable JSON representation for types we store on disk with the fact that we want to support non-JSON types.  We should make it obvious from the type what's a pseudotype and what's a \"native\" type."
