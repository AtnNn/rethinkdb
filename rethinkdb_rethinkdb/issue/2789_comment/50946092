      "@AtnNn: Actually, after a talk with Marc we were thinking of adding a secondary index's code to `index_status` (we want this for the import/export scripts too) in whatever form the JSON protocol would use to represent it.  Then we would add `r.eval` and write `r.index_create('new_foo', r.index_status('foo')['code'].eval())`.  (This introduces recursion problems, though.)"
