      "Honestly, I don't think time objects should be stored internally as a pseudotype.  I think the way we do binary by performing the conversion on receiving from/sending to the client would be the best.  \r\n\r\nRegardless, we can't make a change like this without requiring a full export/import of data because time objects can be used in primary keys.  If we are only talking about having users rebuild sindexes, that won't be sufficient."
