      "The problem with silently switching over is that people will upgrade, run for a few hours or days, then their app will randomly break when we're done building the index and switch over (if they happened to be depending on the old behavior).  This is different from breaking right when they upgrade, when they're presumably awake and on the lookout for problems.  It might still be better though.\r\n\r\nI definitely think we should make the flow as nice as possible.  @neumino, do you have the time to do some work on the web UI to show people what indexes are out of date and give them a button to press to update them?"
