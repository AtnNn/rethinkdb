      "> We should not encourage users to rename their indexes. It will break all their code that uses indexes.\r\n\r\nUsers need to be able to rename indexes so that they can build new, correctly-behaving indexes, without losing availability.\r\n\r\n> Can an index_rebuild command be implemented that rebuilds the index named in its first argument or all indexes on the preceding table or database when given no arguments?\r\n\r\nTheir existing index needs to continue existing while the new one is being built.  Thus the new index needs to be created with a different name, and then renamed later."
