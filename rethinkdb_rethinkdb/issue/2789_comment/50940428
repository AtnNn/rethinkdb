      "Can we have the process of migrating indexes be done automatically under the hood?\r\nCreate the new index, and remove the old index when the new one is ready.\r\n\r\nIf not, it's not so much a seamless migration to me.\r\n\r\nThe problem with manually doing it is that it's hard to know how long an index needs to be built."
