      "> Honestly, I don't think time objects should be stored internally as a pseudotype.\r\n\r\nI think the question of how we store something internally is completely separate from how we present it to the user.  I think times should always be a pseudotype from the user's perspective because it makes sense if they think of us as a JSON store; I think we should store them internally in whatever way is most efficient.\r\n\r\n> Regardless, we can't make a change like this without requiring a full export/import of data because time objects can be used in primary keys.\r\n\r\nGood point."
