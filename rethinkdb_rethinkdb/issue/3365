        "@larkost suggested renaming `table_config()` and `db_config()` to `config()` (or `configuration()`), and have them become methods on table and database objects respectively.\r\n\r\nSo `r.db('db').table_config('table')` would become `r.db('db').table('table').config()`\r\nand `r.db_config('db')` would become `r.db('db').config()`.\r\n\r\nI like this syntax quite a bit more than the current one to be honest, and find it more intuitive.\r\n\r\nThere are a few disadvantages:\r\n- You lose the ability to run `table_config('table1', 'table2', ...)` on multiple tables at once (same for `db_config()`)\r\n- You lose the ability to run `r.db('db').table_config()` without arguments on a database. Right now this would return a selection on the configurations of all tables in 'db'.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug @mlucy @timmaxw What are your thoughts on this?\r\n\r\n(related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3315 )"
