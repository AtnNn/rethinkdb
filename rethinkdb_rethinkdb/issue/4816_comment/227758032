      "I ran into this bug as well. There are two problems:\r\n\r\n1. Whatever kind of stream is being returned by the tls connection doesn't appear to have a connect event. Instead you need to handle the connect/error using a callback.\r\n2. Node 0.10's version of pbkdf2 doesn't support passing a digest argument and uses HMAC-SHA1 by default, instead you need to use this npm package: pbkdf2-sha256\r\n\r\nIn order to fix this I cloned the rethinkdbdash npm package (I'm not very familiar with coffeescript and was in a rush), the code is almost identical to your connection code. Here's the diff: https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash/pull/264/files"
