Also, the selection of which \"violent\" names are bad and which are okay as seen in this pull request is transparently religiously and culturally biased.\r\n\r\nI have reverted this change as of bbc0635a7372060713630db82a7407bc8dcba3fa and will continue to do so.  Please come up with a complete reformulation of the naming scheme instead."
