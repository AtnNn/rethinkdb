      "Hi, @srh. I can understand why you think there was religious/cultural bias going on here. I was trying not to remove names based entirely on religious standards - I was trying to think, on a practical basis, \"what names, if someone powers up RethinkDB and sees this as the name of their server, could startle them or possibly even trigger them, based on life experiences or cultural values?\" And I think that at least some of the names, like \"Nightstalker\" and \"Sniper,\" definitely fit this criteria from anyone's perspective. I didn't remove \"Knight\"-based names because knights (unlike nightstalkers, snipers, or even shadowdemons) rarely carry strongly religious, occult, or violent connotations (for example, Tim Berners-Lee is a knight), even in other cultures, and most users are unlikely to have had personal bad experiences with knights.\r\n\r\nBut, I am a Western Christian so it's possible that there was bias in selecting names to remove. Obviously, @coffeemug is your boss so you should re-merge the commit, but I'd be fine if you removed additional server names with religious associations that I might have missed in the first pass."
