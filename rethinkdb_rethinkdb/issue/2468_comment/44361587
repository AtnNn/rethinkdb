      "Respectfully:\r\n\r\n- It isn't your decision. ~~Religious and cultural direction of the company is mine to set.~~ EDIT: The cultural and social values of the company are mine to set. There is no religious direction and couldn't be, as we are a secular organization.\r\n- If you disagree and care about it deeply, please bring it up with me privately. Unilaterally reverting commits isn't an acceptable practice. If you object to merging the commit back in, I'll ask someone else to do it, but please don't unilaterally revert them in perpetuity.\r\n- This is an external contribution, and a slightly different etiquette applies here than our usual internal one. Please, let's not turn this issue into something bigger than it needs to be."
