      "@srh: Thanks for the explanation. Some of the names (like \"Nightstalker\") I felt were universally problematic, but, as you said, some of them were cultural. (And honestly I just put Broodmother on the list because I don't like spiders.) I wasn't trying to imply that those were the *only* problematic names, and I'm sorry if I gave you that impression."
