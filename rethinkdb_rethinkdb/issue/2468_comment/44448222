      "A lot of the names are clearly not good names for servers in a professional environment.\r\nWe will remove all of them with https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/236\r\n\r\nRemoving some of them is a change in the right direction, as long as a sufficient number of names remain.\r\n\r\nThere will always be names and words that offend some people in some contexts. That's unavoidable. That doesn't mean however that we cannot gradually \"improve\" the naming scheme such that it feels bad for a *smaller* number of people.\r\nI agree that the word \"knight\" *should* have worse connotations than so called occult words that refer to things that don't exist and have never existed. That's why both should go away. At the same time we want to build RethinkDB to leave a positive impression with as many people as possible, as early as possible. I'm confident that the change by @leafstorm improves upon that aspect. That's why it should be merged in."
