      "Well, @leafstorm I'm sorry for reverting the commit last night.  I was feeling a bit too righteous then.  (No, this isn't just because Slava threatened to fire me or anything, that happens biannually.)  (I don't even disagree with any of the removals in that commit (I'm not a fan of dota names at all or really any \"fun\" names in general), what I did think is that picking a set containing many distasteful names, then randomly selecting members of the community and removing what they find distasteful, will result in a set friendly to the majority but still unfriendly to minorities.)\r\n\r\nAnd I'm sorry to everybody else for just going and unilaterally making changes to 'next'."
