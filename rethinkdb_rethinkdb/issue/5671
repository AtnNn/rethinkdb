        "We have recently moved from compiling our MacOS packages on a 10.7 machine to one running 10.10 (with settings to ensure compatibility with 10.7). This has worked out very well in most cases, but the resulting `Uninstall RethinkDB.app` crashes (SIGSEV) on 10.7 machines. Unfortunately, we only noticed this after we shipped the 2.3.0 package, so we have a bad version out in the wild.\r\n\r\nAfter working on this a little it turns out that this appears to be a bug in 10.10 that Apple has fixed on 10.11. So this is more of a record-keeping message, since the solution is to move our builder to 10.11, which I am doing as I write this."
