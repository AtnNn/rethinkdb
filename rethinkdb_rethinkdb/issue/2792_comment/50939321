      "That's an improvement, but it still has weird behavior in some cases. For example, `(...).update({\"a\": 2})` would behave differently from `(...).update({\"a\": 2, \"b\": r.row[\"b\"]+0})`. One of the advantages of the single-vector-clock option is that we can tell people that write on artificial tables behave exactly like non-atomic writes on regular tables."
