      "> Hypothetically we could try to distinguished between \"untouched fields\" and \"fields that were overwritten with the same value\"\r\n\r\nIt would actually be pretty easy right now, because the way we do `merge` you'll end up with a `counted_t<const datum_t>` pointing to a different `datum_t` than before for every changed field, regardless of whether the new value compares equal to the old value."
