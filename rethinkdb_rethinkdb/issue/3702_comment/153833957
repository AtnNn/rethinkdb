      "> +1 for `done`, and specifically the ability to call `done(false)` to stop `cursor.each()` iteration via an async func.\r\n\r\n@ember-max I implemented support for this in a promise-based API. See #4784. See [#4784 (comment)](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/4784#issuecomment-142113485) for my proposal on how we could unify this functionality and support the callback-style as well.\r\n\r\nYou should be fine closing a `cursor` mid-stream. It cleans up all pending callbacks for you and (I think) ignores any further responses received for that feed until the connection is finally closed."
