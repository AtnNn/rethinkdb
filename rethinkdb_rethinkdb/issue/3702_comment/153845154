      "@marshall007 Great, yeah I've been utilizing my own promise-wrapper around `cursor.each`, so seeing something formalized would be great. The issue I'm encountering is that when I invoke `cursor.close`, there's no way for me to listen for this event and terminate my promise (either with a resolve or reject). \r\n\r\nEDIT: I can conceivably pass the resolve/reject handlers out to the same code that is calling `cursor.close` but it starts to feel like so much duct tape + glue :)"
