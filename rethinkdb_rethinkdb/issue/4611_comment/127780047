      "I certainly don't have the experience with the code to know whether this is feasible or not, but could js compilations be cached across queries? \r\n\r\nThis would probably introduce new concerns around memory usage required to maintain an LRU cache. Alternatively, rethinkdb could upon request return a binary blob which can be provided back by the user upon a subsequent query, moving the memory management requirements to the user. I imagine official clients could introduce a convenient client side caching layer.\r\n"
