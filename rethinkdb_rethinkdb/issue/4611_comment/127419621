      "@qusiax, I can't tell at the moment why compiling the function timed out in this case, but we do cache the compiled functions already.  The cache may be cleared if there is a problem communicating with the worker process, but you should see errors in the server's log if and when that happens.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the cache is not shared between queries, so the cache is only an advantage if the `r.js` function is used multiple times in the same query."
