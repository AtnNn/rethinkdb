      "Would that be beneficial to a user? Even if I knew that this exception\nhappened is there a user side action I could take at runtime?\n\nIt's worth noting that this happened on a non mutating query that's run\nbasically on the hot path of the code (so it was a run a bunch of times\nbefore failing).\n\nIs there a way to instruct the compiler to cache compilations? Or a way to\nprecompile statically rather than passing in a js string?\n\nOn Mon, Aug 3, 2015 at 4:26 PM, Tryneus <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> It appears there is an unhandled case where we timeout when compiling a\n> function - it's expecting an id to be returned, but it's getting an error\n> instead.
