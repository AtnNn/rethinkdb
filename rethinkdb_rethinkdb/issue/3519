        "In policing the tests in #2436 I looked over sharding post-reql_admin and have come to the conclusion that there is probably no good reason to keep the sharding code in `test-runner` for the polyglot (YAML) tests for the following reasons:\n1. The current code needs an update for reql_admin since it uses the now-removed command-line interface and had fixed split points (no longer possible).\n2. Even with the change the to move the code to reql_admin the strategy used was not good. It is injecting the shard command before the table is created. This could be fixed by re-architecting that to modify any found `table_create` lines , but...\n3. Because the split points are now auto-created based on the keys in the table we need to put the `reconfigure` after the table has data in it. Detecting where that is in a given table is going to be near impossible unless we do something stupid like put a `reconfigure` line after every `insert`.\n4. Since polyglot tests can now use `reconfigure` to create/alter sharding any test that does so deliberately is not going to like us messing with what it has already done.\n"
