        "@AtnNn @danielmewes \r\n\r\nRan into an issue which i put the gist link below its related not using the right datatypes in python and not knowing how to serialize. The first guess is that here is None in the primary key but the real issue is that i used tuple and not a list and it was not very happy about that the error should be a little different.\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/wojons/3a227ca112584b3a13f5"
