      "Switching between `each` and `next` seems weird but having multiple calls to `each` seems very reasonable. I could see doing pagination like this for example. Also since keeping a cursor open is something we're going to make incredibly light weight on the server this change is mostly about having a nice API and it seems like it's nicer if you can call `each` multiple times on the same cursor."
