        "I noticed 29 bugs that marked as high existed for a relative long time, and I think many people will be scared away by any of them, such as: 100% cpu usages, crashing, lost all data. By my experience, if a customer reported a bug, it will be fixed, most of time, within half a day. Maybe distributed databases like rethinkdb are too complicated to debug, but I am interested in What kinds of reasons are causing the bugs so slow to be fixed? Can you guys share these?\n"
