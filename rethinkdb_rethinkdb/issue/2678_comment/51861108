      "When the user sends a write to a server, it will eventually be performed by all of the replicas unless they become unavailable. If a write is performed by a replica, then it will be visible in the future unless that replica is permanently removed. The ack settings determine how many replicas must perform a write before it is acknowledged to the client.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the user wants to ensure that any write acknowledged to the client will be visible in the future as long as no more than one server crashes, they can set the ack settings to require a minimum of two servers to perform the write.\r\n\r\nNote that it's possible that a write will be visible even if it is not acknowledged to the client."
