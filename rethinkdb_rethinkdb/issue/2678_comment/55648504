      "When we support failover, we'll implement the Raft consensus algorithm, and we'll use it to track which version of the data is legitimate. In your example, A will keep the quorum write, but not because it's a quorum write--if the first write had been a quorum write and the second had been an immediate write, the second write would still be kept. (This doesn't violate the the safety guarantees for quorum writes because the first write is only written to two servers, so an ack never would be sent to the client.)"
