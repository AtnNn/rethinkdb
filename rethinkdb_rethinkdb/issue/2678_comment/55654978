      "For shipping `reql_admin`, we'll still require people to permanently remove servers, and we won't yet provide any official safety guarantees for writes run in `quorum` mode.\r\n\r\nNo, we won't use two-phase commit. Replicas will apply the writes as soon as they receive them. This means a replica can sometimes apply a write that later turns out not to be legitimate. When this happens, the replica will have to revert the write. Currently the only way to revert a write is to erase everything and re-backfill; we might have to come up with a better solution before we ship auto-failover. \r\n\r\nThis also means that it's possible for a read to see a write that later turns out not to be legitimate. We might want to offer a \"quorum read\" mode, which guarantees that this won't happen."
