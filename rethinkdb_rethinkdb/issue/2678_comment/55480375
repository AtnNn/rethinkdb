      "How is that going to play with auto failover?\r\n\r\nHaving writes sent in `immediate` mode can create vector clock conflicts right? How are we going to make the distinction between an `immediate` write and a `quorum` write to know what version of the data we should keep?\r\n\r\n\r\nCould we move the ack mode to the server and not the query?\r\n- quorum writes will still have to wait for an immediate write, right? In which case I don't really see the point of mixing both settings\r\n- That would avoid having to make the distinction between quorum and writes queries in case of conflicts."
