      "After the first netsplit, a Raft quorum will form with (`C`, `D`, `E`). This Raft quorum will choose `C` as director on the condition that it proceeds from the latest write that is available to `C`, `D`, or `E`. This step makes the first write illegitimate. After the second netsplit, `B` will learn the Raft state through `D` and `E`, so it will revert the first write and continue from the state that is stored on `D` and `E`."
