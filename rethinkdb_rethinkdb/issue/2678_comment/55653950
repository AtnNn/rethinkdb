      "Ok, that works for me.\r\n\r\nTwo more questions though:\r\n- Does it mean that for the next version (before we ship auto-failover with the Raft consensus), we will keep track of what data is legitimate?  \r\nOr will we forbid people to change the director if one of the primary replicas is not available?\r\n- If we keep track of what data is legitimate, does it mean we have two phase commits writes? Meaning that before a director sends an acknowledgement, it will make sure that all the replicas that wrote on disk know that the last write is now acknowledged? "
