      "@neumino: The case I have seen is where you have permanent data in one table, and temporary state data in the other. For instance in a testing system I worked on before we had test results, which I would have wanted multiple acks on, and then a constant stream of state data from the clients. This latter state data was something that we needed in a common place (both for showing state on the web site, and as a place for the client to store it in case of reboot), but there was no durability requirements so I would have set it for no acks required (essentially that is what I did in code).\r\n\r\nBoth of these tables referenced common data on other tables, so they made sense in the same database."
