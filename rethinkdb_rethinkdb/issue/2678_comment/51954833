      "Sorry, I didn't properly write down my question. I was wondering when you need different number of acks on the same table.\r\n\r\nIf the number of acks doesn't change, shouldn't we keep it as a per-table option?\r\n\r\nAlso it means that if you want the number of ack to be the number of replicas, then every time you add a new server, you have to update your whole code base, which doesn't seem super-friendly to me."
