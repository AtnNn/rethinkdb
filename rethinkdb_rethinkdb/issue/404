        "I started a node on newton, but forgot a `--bind all`. I then started another node on the network trying to connect to the node on newton. I got the following output on the second node:\n\n```\ncoffeemug$ rethinkdb --join newton:29032\ninfo: Running rethinkdb 1.3.2-fallback (CLANG 4.1 ((tags/Apple/clang-421.11.66)))...\ninfo: Loading data from directory rethinkdb_data\ninfo: Listening on addresses (add more using '--bind'): 127.0.0.1.\ninfo: Listening for intracluster connections on port 29015.\n```\n\nThe trouble here is that I can't by casual (or detailed) inspection determine that the node didn't manage to connect to the cluster (or in this case the other node). We should log a message \"Trying to connect to blah\" in the initial joiner, which would make it obvious that there is an operation in progress.\n"
