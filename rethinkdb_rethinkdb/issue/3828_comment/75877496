      "Seems to be reproducible on different hardware; grab the kamikazi64 ISO from\r\nhttps://github.com/kamilion/kamikazi-deploy\r\nand make a *LABELED* btrfs partition (bonus points if you choose the label \"cloudmaster\" to coincide with my configuration) and kamikazi will find it and mount it under /mnt/btrfs/cloudmaster/ for you.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce it with just a 32GB USB stick with a 4GB fat32 boot containing the ISO and a fresh 28GB btrfs following it."
