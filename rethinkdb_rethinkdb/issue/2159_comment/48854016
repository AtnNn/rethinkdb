      "To add to the mystery (and I do believe this is related), we've been experiencing a lot of `net::ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH` issues with assets in our rails app (that shares the same VM as the RethinkDB instance).\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time on Friday investigating and trying various VBox configurations, and as weird and unrelated this may seem, setting the number of processors the VM uses to 1, all issues seem to go away (with the issues listed above, it was previously configured to 4 [same as the host machine]).\r\n\r\nI created a ruby script (https://gist.github.com/barkerja/9d1ea83d07652a0df75d) to compare the actual size of the response sent vs. the size sent in the `Content-Length` header, and with > 1 CPUs defined, I get a lot of sporadic size mismatches. So I think it's safe to say the same thing is happening with the RethinkDB admin UI (although I didn't test it before I made the config change).\r\n\r\nSo this is highly likely it's not a RethinkDB -specific bug, but regardless, it's still a terrible experience if there is any sort of connection loss that you lose everything on page and forced a page reload. #2460 will be a much welcome fix. :+1:"
