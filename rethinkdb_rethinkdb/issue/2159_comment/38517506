      "I just run RethinkDB in a docker, and I don't get any timeouts or issues.\r\n\r\n@barkerja -- I have a few more questions for you\r\n- Do you run everything on your local machine? (RethinkDB, browser, and ruby script)\r\n- You are using a SSD right?\r\n- Do you do bulk inserts of 1000 documents, wait for it to finish then fire another bulk insert? Or do call execute the queries in parallel?\r\n\r\n\r\nI've been testing things on my laptop which runs on Linux. I'll try to get an OSX machine to see if I can reproduce this."
