      "I personally would caution against implementing features that doesn't scale to multiple shards. Refering to this: \"WRT the cluster-wide mutex, I think an MVP doesn't need it - just force all AODBs to use a single node of the cluster in the first version\". Tho if that means something else, my only quetion is: \"when can I have this, sooner the better\"."
