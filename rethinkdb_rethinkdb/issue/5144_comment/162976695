      "FWIW, I agree with your thoughts @danielmewes.\r\n\r\nUse cases similar to mine would be ecstatic with an implementation of general (slow) transactions: the latency tradeof would be well worth the decreased denormalizing pressure. We also have some smaller instances that don't cluster at all, and there consensus latency is not a concern.\r\n\r\nAO tables sound very cool, but I'm not yet convinced of their larger applicability."
