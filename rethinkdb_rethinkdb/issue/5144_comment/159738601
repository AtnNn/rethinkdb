      "I've suggested to initially implement a single-node mutex only because it would take less time to do it that way. Implementing a multi-node mutex would probably take more time.\r\n\r\nOnce single-node AODB transactions are in place, people could start using it as a test-drive before the real deal arrives. They could send bug reports and once the most glaring bugs are fixed, we could  start implementing multi-node transactions, and then remove the initial single-node limitation.\r\n\r\nPlease see [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)."
