      "The two main advantages to having everything in one folder and then symlinking in:\r\n1. In a normal instal everything will remain in sync.\r\n2. It makes it much easier to install multiple versions and know what is pointing where. I use this method all the time for the multiple versions of interpreters (e.g. Python).\r\n\r\nThe nastiest thorn that this would fix is int he `export`, `import`, `dump`, and `restore` commands. These are problematic both because they require the Python driver to be installed, and because that install currently has to be the systemwide install. So if you are trying to `dump` from one version of RethinkDB and `restore` into another you have to have one version of the driver installed for the old version when using `dump`, and then know to switch to the new version for the `restore` into the the new version. That is a lot of knowledge we are asking people to have.\r\n\r\nIf the drivers were installed in the same directory as the server they go with, then all of those commands can instead import them by relative path. All of that complexity from the previous paragraph goes away for only the cost of allowing different install locations, and a little work to figure out how to symlink."
