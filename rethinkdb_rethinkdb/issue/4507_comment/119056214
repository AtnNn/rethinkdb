      "I think this has to be handled on a per-platform per-driver basis.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should package the nodejs driver. The npm FAQ explains that: \"The global install location is a place for command-line utilities to put their bins in the system PATH. It's not for use with require().\"\r\n\r\nBundling the Ruby and Python driver in the same package as the server may be a good idea on platforms that have Ruby and Python in the base system. On platforms that have good package managers, it may be worth splitting the driver and server packages so they can be installed seperately.\r\n\r\nOn platforms that do not have ruby in the base system, I think providing a system package in addition to the already available gem is not yet useful.\r\n\r\nFor future reference, here are some links to recomendations for packaging Python and Ruby libraries:\r\n\r\n* Centos\r\n  * https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Python\r\n  * https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Ruby\r\n* Debian\r\n  * https://wiki.debian.org/Python/LibraryStyleGuide\r\n  * https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Ruby/Packaging\r\n* Homebrew\r\n  * https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Python-for-Formula-Authors.md\r\n\r\nPackaging the drivers might be a lot easier if we added DESTDIR-aware driver installation to `make install`.\r\n\r\n@larkost why do you suggest putting all the files in the same folder and using symlinks? Why not just put the files directly in the right place?"
