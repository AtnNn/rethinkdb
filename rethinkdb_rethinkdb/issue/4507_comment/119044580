      "@AtnNn once suggested that we could package the drivers in Ubuntu packages. Then the server package could recommend a certain version of the driver, and we could even make it install the Python driver package by default.\r\n\r\nThat would have the advantage that we wouldn't need to add Python, Node and Ruby as dependencies to our main package, and you could also still upgrade the server independently of the driver if you want to which I think is useful in some cases."
