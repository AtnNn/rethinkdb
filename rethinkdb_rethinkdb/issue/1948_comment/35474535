      "Overall, I'm ok with leaving it as it is.\r\n\r\nThe most significant use case probably come from combining JS driver with koa. But as long as it's documented, I think it would be very easy to bind `this`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n_ = require 'underscore'\r\nquery = r.db('test').table('some_table').limit(10)\r\n\r\napp.use (next) -->\r\n  # curry / thunkify\r\n  cursor = yield _.partial(query.run, connection)\r\n  # error\r\n  result  = yield cursor.toArray\r\n  # works\r\n  result  = yield cursor.toArray.bind cursor\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to close this issue if no further objection has been raised."
