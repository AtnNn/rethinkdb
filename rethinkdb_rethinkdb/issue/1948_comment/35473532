      "Sorry I was a little busy then completely forgot about this pull request..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI took a quick look at the code earlier, and didn't pay attention to a few things. \r\n\r\nWe wrap the methods with `ar`, which main task is to check the arity of the method\r\n\r\nIf you replace the arrow with a fat one, you replace `@` with `Cursor` and not the cursor, which is not what you want at all.\r\n\r\nOne way to force to bind to the cursor is to write something like\r\n```\r\nnext: (cb) =>\r\n    (ar (_cb) =>\r\n        ...\r\n    )(cb)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I feel like it's pushing CoffeeScript a little too far. I find the code already a little hard to read, and that would be making it really harder to read without adding much.\r\n\r\nWhile I think it's nice to bind to the instance if possible (especially if it's just replacing an arrow with a fat arrow), I think it's overdoing things in this case.\r\n\r\nI would be in favor of leaving it as it is.\r\nAny objection @hden? If you have an use case where you really need next/each/etc. to be bound to the cursor, I would like to hear it.\r\n"
