      "If we want to stay compatible with the current format, we could add the name as a property to the groups instead:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"end\": 5 ,\r\n    \"groups\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"name\" ,\r\n            \"end\": 5 ,\r\n            \"start\": 3 ,\r\n            \"str\": \"ba\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"end\": 6 ,\r\n            \"start\": 5 ,\r\n            \"str\": \"r\"\r\n        } \r\n    ] ,\r\n    \"start\": 3 ,\r\n    \"str\": \"ba\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not very nice to use though if you want to access a specific named group directly.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to break compatibility here. It's pretty easy to get the old format back by using the discussed `values()` term (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2945).\r\n\r\nIn @AtnNn's proposal, unnamed groups are given numbers as keys. This sounds like a reasonable thing to do. I think we should do that even if there are no named groups at all for consistency."
