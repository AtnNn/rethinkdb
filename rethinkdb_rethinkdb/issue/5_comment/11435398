      "Rethink now builds natively on OS X and we generate a .pkg file. The binaries will be publicly available in the coming days, so we're closing the issue. We decided not to add official homebrew support for the time being because a .pkg seems like a much better user experience.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for help and thanks @srh for incredible work!"
