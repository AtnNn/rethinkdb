      "@coffeemug said:\r\n\r\n> Ok, @atnnn told me to close this, so closing :)\r\n\r\nUm, okay.\r\n\r\nI'm sure @atnnn must have his reasons for wanting this issue closed, but it would have been nice to post those reasons here. I've tested this on a completely fresh Mountain Lion 10.8.2 virtual machine, and it behaves the exact same way, so as it stands now the vast majority of folks trying to install RethinkDB via Homebrew are going to be stymied by this problem. If the plan is to file this in an issue elsewhere, why not reference it here as well?"
