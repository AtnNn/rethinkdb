      "[As I mentioned on Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4949715) a moment ago, I disagree that the .pkg format is better than a Homebrew formula. The former may, as suggested, offer a \"better user experience\" initially, but updating is ten times easier via Homebrew. Moreover, the .pkg installs to `/usr/bin/` and `/usr/share/` \8212 areas that are traditionally reserved for system tools provided by Apple.\r\n\r\nMuch applause and commendations on the Mac OS X release. I highly encourage you to rethink (hehe) this packaging choice, however. Want to offer both? Awesome. But if you're going to pick one or the other, I think Homebrew is the vastly superior method."
