      "@atnnn: Thanks for contributing your [RethinkDB Homebrew formula](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/rethinkdb.rb). I'm not sure if this is the best place to mention it, but I'm having trouble installing RethinkDB via your Homebrew formula. After seeing an error message indicating that LESS is a required dependency, here are the steps I took:\r\n\r\n    $ brew install node\r\n    $ npm install -g less\r\n    $ brew install rethinkdb\r\n\r\nError returned:\r\n\r\n> Unsatisfied dependency: less\r\n> Homebrew does not provide Node dependencies; install with:\r\n>  npm install less\r\n> Error: An unsatisfied requirement failed this build.\r\n\r\nHow is this dependency check performed? For what it's worth, `/usr/local/share/npm/bin` is on my $PATH, and the `lessc` binary contained within appears to function as expected:\r\n\r\n    $ lessc --version\r\n    lessc 1.3.3 (LESS Compiler) [JavaScript]\r\n\r\nThis is on Mac OS X 10.8.2, Xcode 4.6.0, and the January 2013 CLT. Any suggestions as to how to resolve this problem?"
