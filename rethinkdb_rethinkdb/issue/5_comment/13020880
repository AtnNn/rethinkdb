      "@atnnn: The verification you mentioned:\r\n\r\n    node -e 'require (\"less\")'\r\n\r\n... does indeed fail on my system. It appears `NODE_PATH` is undefined. From what I can tell from the [Node formula](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/node.rb), this appears to be normal and intended.\r\n\r\nIf, however, I manually set a `NODE_PATH` environment variable to `/usr/local/share/npm/lib/node_modules`, then the verification passes and `brew install rethinkdb` proceeds without the aforementioned error.\r\n\r\nAs a sidebar, it's worth mentioning that the [`modules_folder` definition](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/node.rb#L97) in the Homebrew formula for Node points to:\r\n\r\n    \"#{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/npm\"  # Resolves to: /usr/local/share/npm\r\n\r\n... whereas `npm install -g less coffee-script` actually puts the modules into `/usr/local/share/npm/lib/node_modules`\r\n\r\nI suspect that the [relevant line](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/node.rb#L97) should instead be:\r\n\r\n    \"#{npm_prefix}/lib/node_modules\"\r\n\r\n... but I say this with complete ignorance of Node, `npm`, the intentions of the associated Homebrew recipe, and whether it would have any effect on this problem."
