      "@atnnn The problem @justinmayer mentions is the exact reason why I had to add the following line to the formula I created:\r\nhttps://github.com/RyanAmos/homebrew/blob/rethinkdb-formula/Library/Formula/rethinkdb.rb#L8\r\n\r\nWhen I was running the following line locally, manually, it works, but within homebrew, for some reason it was failing.\r\n```node -e 'require (\"less\")'```\r\n\r\nNot sure what the solution is, but I he wasn't the only one having that issue and that's the sole reason for the line I added mentioned above."
