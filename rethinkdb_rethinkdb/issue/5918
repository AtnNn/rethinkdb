        "Our write performance on MacOS is significantly slower than that on linux, and it looks like the problems are ones that we can't completely address (see rethinkdb/rethinkdb#4650, summary: might be able to speed up everything, but will still be significantly slower on MacOS).\n\nWith Apple currently working on [APFS](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/APFS_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html) there is the chance that this is, or could be, changing. We should investigate this problem a little bit more; specifically by building a minimum reproducible case. Then we could run this on the current HFS+ and compare that against the in-development version of APFS (available though our Apple Developer account). Ideally we would also take the same code and run it under linux on the same hardware.\n\nAt a minimum that would provide us some good data with which to file bugs against Apple, and we could also point at harder numbers when people ask about our performance on MacOS.\n"
