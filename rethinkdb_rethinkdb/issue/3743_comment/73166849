      "I think @mlucy is right, both variants should now work for the JS driver (at least since @gchpaco took the global opt arg validation out of the JS driver and into the server, before that global optargs had to be CamelCase).\r\nSo I think we can get away without doing any translation in the test infrastructure, as long as we always use snake_case in the tests.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should change the official JS API to using snake_case for everything (or even just for optargs). That would be a very big API change and would make the JS driver feel much less natural."
