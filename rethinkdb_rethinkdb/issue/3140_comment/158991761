      "@deontologician With PostgreSQL I usually create a tsvector[1] column and feed it with different fields (while assigning a weight) I want to include whenever I do an INSERT or UPDATE. Then when I want to search I perform a search only on the tsvector column. This approach has it's obvious drawbacks, but I would argue that it's enough for 80% of smaller projects or projects where search is not the main feature.\r\n\r\n[1]http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/textsearch-controls.html"
