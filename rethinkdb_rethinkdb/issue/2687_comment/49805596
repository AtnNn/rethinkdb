      "@srh :\r\n* It's less work to just fix the header order than it is to do a git blame and open a GitHub issue.\r\n* This won't encourage good behavior the way you want, because it's *still* easier to fix these issues as they're opened than it is to run the style checker before committing.  (Not that people shouldn't run the style checker, but this doesn't change the responsibility-laziness tradeoff.)\r\n\r\nThis is strictly more work than what we were doing before, creates a bunch of noise on the issue tracker for everyone else, and doesn't actually create the incentives you're trying to create (it's still easier not to run the style checker than to run it)."
