      "Hi @kmcgrady ,\r\nwhich driver are you using for this? The node driver, Python, Ruby?\r\n\r\nCould you post a code snippet to make it clearer what's happening? I'm not entirely sure I understand what's going on yet. So the middleware opens the connection through `r.connect` right? \r\nWhen you say that the web service \"loads rethinkdb\", you mean that it loads the rethinkdb driver?\r\n\r\nWhat's the exact error message you're getting when the connection is claimed to not be open? Do you get a backtrace with the error?"
