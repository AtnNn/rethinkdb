      "Thanks for the code and example @kmcgrady .\r\n\r\nThis is probably because we check `net.isConnection` on the connection parameter which checks that the connection argument is an instance of a specific `Connection` class.\r\nSo if the driver is imported twice, the classes won't match and the `instanceof` will fail.\r\n\r\n@deontologician do you know if there's a standard way to avoid such issues?\r\n\r\nAn easy (but slightly hacky) work-around would be to not use `instanceof` but instead have a special magic value field in the `Connection` that we can test for."
