      "You could try [`npm dedupe`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dedupe) to flatten out the dependency tree so that each web service references the same package.\r\n\r\nThis will become the default behavior in `npm@3.0` as mentioned in [this blog post](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/110924823920/npm-weekly-5), so it shouldn't be an issue too much longer!"
