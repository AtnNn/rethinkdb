      "This looks related to #3263.\r\n\r\nThe RethinkDB driver checks that the connection it is given is an instance of `Connection`. If you've loaded two different drivers, the `Connection` class will not be the same in both, and the check will fail with the error `RqlDriverError: First argument to `run` must be an open connection`.\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple instances instance of the rethinkdb driver in your `node_modules` tree, you can perhaps use [peer dependencies](http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/02/07/peer-dependencies/) to solve the issue."
