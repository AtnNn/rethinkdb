      "@neumino Sure, I know how to solve it, for that reason I told all the details about why the error raised.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I don't know if it something that rethinks should support, but I wanted to expose after we faced it.\r\n\r\nIn our implementation it is required from only one module and the reason which we had the connection created in one module and the query in another was because we had an implementation of one module that we decided to break in two modules, one contains a functionality (e.g. A) which we will use from different ones (first one to use A is for example B), which it is quite usual refactoring to do. The issue came with that refactoring, because we started to do the refactoring in small steps and in one of them the connection was create in module A and the query in module B, and it happened that.\r\n\r\nI don't want to say that it is an issue, only wanted to report as an information and you can decide if you would like to make a mention in the documentation.\r\n\r\nI appreciate very much your fast response and dedication, it has been a pleasure.
