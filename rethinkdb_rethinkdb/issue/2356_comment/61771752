      "I think there ought to be a way to introduce this functionality such that it plays elegantly with the existing primitives. I'm not entirely sure what that is yet -- it probably isn't \"just run these filters as efficiently as you can\", but there must be something there. We'll think hard about this after the upcoming 2.0 launch and hopefully find something delightful that satisfies this use case.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, what project are you working on?"
