      "I really like that the index usage is not automatic. It makes performance more predictable.\r\n\r\nIn NoBrainer, the amount of code to discover optimizations with indexes is not that big: https://github.com/nviennot/nobrainer/blob/master/lib/no_brainer/criteria/where.rb#L199-L258\r\n\r\nIt can be interesting to prevent inefficient queries from running directly from the client side, so that queries that don't scale don't make it to production.\r\n\r\nFor more info on the auto index usgae semantics: http://nobrainer.io/docs/indexes/#using_indexes\r\n\r\nTo me, the index concern should be left to the client side for predicability."
