      "The admin in me also likes the current behavior. It's very convenient to be absolutely sure which parts of my querying code use an index and which parts do not. It eliminates a whole class of issues where you have to guess whether your code is slow because of a bad optimization, a change in statistics, a mismatched deployment script, etc.\r\n\r\nI don't think we'll be changing this in the near future because the behavior turns out to be so nice. We might change it later as we uncover new information, but almost certainly in a way that preserves this property."
