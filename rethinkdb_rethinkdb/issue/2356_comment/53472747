      "From the [Cassandra tutorial](http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/ddl/ddl_music_service_c.html):\r\n\r\n>With the schema as given so far, a query that includes the artist filter would require a sequential scan across the entire playlists dataset. Cassandra will reject such a query. If you first create an index on artist, Cassandra can efficiently pull out the records in question.\r\n\r\nThis is awesome, and the current behavior in Rethink is basically the contrapositive (with exception of `.filter()`, which might be marked \"use with caution\"), and is also awesome."
