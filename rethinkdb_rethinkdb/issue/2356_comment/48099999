      "Just had this exchange with @neumino on IRC:\r\n\r\n>19:15 < dimadima> i'm not an experienced DB person, but one thing i really like about rethink is the explicit use of secondary indexes\r\n> 19:15 < dimadima> i saw somewhere in the docs that the query planner is going to be use them implicitly in the future, which i guess is cool, but having to use them explicitly is actually really nice for starting out\r\n> 19:16 < dimadima> you know what's up. it's not like the \"query profile\" info is very meaningful to me at this state of my rethink experience\r\n> 19:34 <@neumino> dimadima, feel free to chime in: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2356\r\n\r\nWhich is how I expressed it, but @mlucy and @nviennot say it even better. I think the explicitness is really nice on several levels.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think @neumino opening comment to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1032 is spot on, too, and complements this thread nicely. If you do have an index on a field and make use of `getAll()`, conceptually you ought to get the same results as with `filter()`."
