      "@mike-marcacci thanks for the feedback! That's very useful.\r\n\r\nWe now have a second proposal that aims to solve the main issues with building dynamic indexed queries. You can find it here: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4150\r\nWould that work for you?\r\n\r\nGetting out the details of an index function would be addressed by https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3231 ."
