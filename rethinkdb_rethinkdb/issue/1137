        "The fact that `rethinkdb dump` doesn't dump secondary indexes (and they cannot be restored) confused at least one person: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5991301. (Actually he was confused about the old migration script, but this applies to `rethinkdb dump` as well).\n\nI think we should add the following warning to the `dump` command:\n\n```\n$ rethinkdb dump ...\nNOTE: `rethinkdb dump` only dumps data and does *not* dump\nsecondary indexes or cluster metadata. You will need to recreate\nyour secondary indexes and cluster setup manually when you run\n`rethinkdb restore`.\n```\n"
