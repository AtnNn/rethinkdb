      "In ReQL admin, table responsibilities are bound to individual servers.\r\nWe don't have data centers anymore, but if you change the \"tags\" of a server (a more flexible replacement for DCs), this does no longer affect the server assignments of existing tables.\r\n\r\nTo reassign servers in ReQL admin, you'd need to run an explicit `reconfigure` specifying the desired tags to use for replicas.\r\n\r\nSo I think this issue has gone away."
