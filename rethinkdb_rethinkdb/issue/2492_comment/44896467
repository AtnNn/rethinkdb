      "Thank you for describing your idea here @wojons.\r\n\r\nJust to make this a bit clearer: The idea is to be able to move all responsibilities from one node to a specific other node, isn't it? Or did you have something else in mind?\r\n\r\nThis issue is vaguely related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2252 , though in that issue responsibilities would not be transferred to a specific other node."
