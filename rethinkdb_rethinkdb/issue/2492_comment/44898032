      "@wojons: Does this example describe the desired behavior?\r\nSuppose you have two data centers DC1 and DC2, and let's say two servers S1 in DC1 and S2 in DC2.\r\nLet's further say we have a table and have configured it to have its primaries in DC1.\r\nNow you want to move server S1 from DC1 into DC2.\r\nShould the shards of the table that are on S1 now be automatically reconfigured to have their primaries in DC2 instead of DC1?"
