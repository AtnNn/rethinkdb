      "Making rarely changed index structures sequential on disk is certainly a good idea. I don't know when and if we will get to that, but it would certainly improve performance on rotational drives a lot.\r\n\r\nIt's not necessary to split the table into multiple files for that. Our file is already organized into \"extents\" (contiguous sections of currently 512 KB), which we can rewrite one at a time.\r\nThose already provide a division of the data. 512 KB is not that much of course, we could certainly make them a bit larger to make access patterns even more sequential."
