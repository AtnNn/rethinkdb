      "@danielmewes yeah that can work the reason why i think about different files is that the old block would have to be marked as deleted or deleted then and the new block would have to be appened or hopefuuly they are right net to each other but if you allocate a 100mb index file or what ever all in one go wit will be sequcal for sure and you can delete and remake the file at once. :) but again just random suggestion to get it to be a lot faster on spinning diks."
