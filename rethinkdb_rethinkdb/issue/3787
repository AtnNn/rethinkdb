        "I'm having problems with a table being basically useless for reads while doing relatively moderate writes.\r\n\r\nWithout any writes a get operation returns in about 200 ms. When doing ~50-60 inserts a second I get results like these for the same operation:\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"description\":  \"Perform read.\" ,\r\n  \"duration(ms)\": 24411.997251 ,\r\n  \"sub_tasks\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"parallel_tasks\": [\r\n    [{\r\n       \"description\":  \"Perform read on shard.\" ,\r\n       \"duration(ms)\": 24410.180832 ,\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The inserted documents have about 20-25 fields with mostly strings of a sentence or two and I'm using soft durability, update on conflict and no batching (one insert per query).\r\n\r\n- The machine has 64GB memory and a SSD disk and is configured with 512 io-threads and memory set to 40000 (I've also tried 64 and 128 io-threads and letting RethinkDB allocate memory on its own but with similar results).\r\n\r\n- The table has 110 million records\r\n\r\nAnything that stands out?\r\n\r\nIn general, RethinkDB isn't giving me the performance I would like so what's the next step if I can't change to a bigger machine? Would it help if I got more machines and set them up as replicas or shards?"
