        "I'm having problems with a table being basically useless for reads while doing relatively moderate writes.\n\nWithout any writes a get operation returns in about 200 ms. When doing ~50-60 inserts a second I get results like these for the same operation:\n\n``` js\n{\n  \"description\":  \"Perform read.\" ,\n  \"duration(ms)\": 24411.997251 ,\n  \"sub_tasks\": [\n  {\n    \"parallel_tasks\": [\n    [{\n       \"description\":  \"Perform read on shard.\" ,\n       \"duration(ms)\": 24410.180832 ,\n...\n```\n- The inserted documents have about 20-25 fields with mostly strings of a sentence or two and I'm using soft durability, update on conflict and no batching (one insert per query).\n- The machine has 64GB memory and a SSD disk and is configured with 512 io-threads and memory set to 40000 (I've also tried 64 and 128 io-threads and letting RethinkDB allocate memory on its own but with similar results).\n- The table has 110 million records\n\nAnything that stands out?\n\nIn general, RethinkDB isn't giving me the performance I would like so what's the next step if I can't change to a bigger machine? Would it help if I got more machines and set them up as replicas or shards?\n"
