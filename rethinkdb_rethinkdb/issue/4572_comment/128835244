      "Actually http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/ says that the unit of `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time` is seconds and not milliseconds. This would explain why they picked a default of 7200, which is 2 hours.\r\nHowever it doesn't explain why I'm actually getting the timeout after 11-12 minutes."
