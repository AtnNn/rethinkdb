      "My first results have been inconclusive. We already enable TCP keepalive for client connections on the server. I also turned it on in rethinkdbdash.\r\nHowever it still took the driver a very long time (in the range of an hour) before it detected the loss of the connection. There might be some parameters that we can tune to make it react more quickly."
