      "@freedombird9 -- we talked about this a bit internally.  Theoretically TCP should prevent this from happening, but apparently we've had experiences in the past where that doesn't happen for whatever reason.  The solution is probably to add explicit keepalive messages to the driver protocol.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes -- We could do that but I think it would be better to add explicit keepalive messages.  That would also solve problems like \"I opened this connection, waited an hour and then ran a query on it.\" or \"I ran this really long analytics query that took more than an hour to return\"."
