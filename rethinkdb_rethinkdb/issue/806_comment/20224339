      "@atnnn -- I would really strongly prefer that we not do this until 1.9 or 2.0 when the RQL changes have slowed down.  There's nothing worse than having an interface change under you when there are a bunch of RQL terms in code review.\r\n\r\nAfter that, though, it would be wonderful.  This is an important enough interface that I think we should talk about the new one; could you write up a RQL proposal with the new interface you're proposing?"
