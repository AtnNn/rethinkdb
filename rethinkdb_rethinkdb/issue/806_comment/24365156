      "My opinion (@atnnn, @mlucy -- feel free to ignore it) is that we should still hold off on making this change. We have a lot on our plates; refactoring code now might introduce bugs that puts even more on our plates and makes stability work harder. I'd rather focus 100% on fixing issues that users face, and do this post 2.0 when things calm down a bit."
