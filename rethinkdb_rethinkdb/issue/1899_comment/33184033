      "If you want to get back smaller batches (e.g. for debugging a driver), you can pass the optarg `batch_conf` to `run` (this works in release mode too but is undocumented since it's for development/testing rather than users).  So like `query.run(batch_conf:{max_els:5})` would limit you to 5 elements per batch.\r\n\r\nWe used to send smaller batches in debug mode, but:\r\n* Release-mode batching kept breaking because we weren't smoke-testing it during development.\r\n* It led to really bad performance (as in, bad enough it was sometimes irritating to use)."
