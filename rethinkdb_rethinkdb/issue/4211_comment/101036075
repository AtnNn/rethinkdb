      "Hey @dparnell, nice patch. Thank you for the pull request.\r\n\r\nI think we are not going to merge this into the main driver for now, because we won't be using it in our web UI and wouldn't have a great way for testing it and making sure that the code keeps working. I hope you understand.\r\n\r\nThat being said we have thought about switching the web UI to websockets (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3510), and if we end up doing that, your patches might become useful for the main driver.\r\nAnother change in our main server that would make this really useful would be adding user authentication and additional security https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/218 . At that point it will become feasible to connect directly from the browser to a database for a larger group of users, and websockets would likely be the way to go about that.\r\n\r\nI think for the time being we won't make this part of the main driver, but I'll keep the pull request open nonetheless. Hope that's ok with you.\r\nDo you have any plans of publishing your changes separately? I'm sure there will be a few people who are interested in this."
