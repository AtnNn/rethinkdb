      "Thanks, I wondered if that might be the case.  I'm also working on adding the ability to authenticate via a web page.  The idea I'm working on at the moment is to have a proxy that sits in front of the rethinkdb server that uses a provided auth token to determine the user logging in.  This is then used to get the privs that should be granted to the user and so any query that comes in is augmented/checked to ensure the user has the necessary privs on the desired tables."
