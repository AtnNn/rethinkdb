      "Possibly, it's written in Erlang at the moment which does limit the number of potential developers, but once there is a reference implementation porting it to another language wouldn't be too tricky.  The other thing I'm working on at the moment is some new functions in ReQL to materialize a subselect to stop rethinkdb from re-evaluating it each time through a filter function.  I've got that part working and while it helped the query I'm trying to do it's still too slow so I'm looking at trying to make a new function that sorts a given array so that the `contains` function can use a binary chop search instead of a linear search.  It's been fun digging through the guts of the rethinkdb codebase :smile: "
