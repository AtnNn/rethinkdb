      "One minor advantage of the `{old_val: _, new_val: _}` format is that it gives us more flexibility to add additional fields or event types later. For example, we've discussed adding `{error: _}` events, and in #3471 we discussed adding a `timestamp` field. Neither of those is necessary for point changefeeds, but it makes me think that we might later want to add a field or event type that does make sense for point changefeeds.\r\n\r\nEdit: The reason why the `timestamp` field doesn't make sense for point changefeeds is that the main purpose of timestamps is to resume an interrupted changefeed, and for a point changfeed it's easy to just re-send the whole value. But there are other possible uses of timestamps, such as correctly interleaving updates between two separate changefeeds. Timestamps on point changefeeds might make sense in that case. This would require some additional server support, and I'm not sure if it's worth it; but it's an example of something we might want to do in the future. Maybe I'm overthinking this."
