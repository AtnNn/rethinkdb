      "I wouldn't change it this late in the release cycle. We've thought it through quite extensively. That's not to say that the decision was correct, just that I'd wait to release 1.16, get user feedback, and then reconsider if necessary. I think we're going to get *a lot* of new knowledge about the feeds API after release, so I wouldn't design new things (or redesign old things) until we hear what users have to say."
