      "Actually, I'd like to go back to this because of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3570 .  We don't have a good way to report errors on non-squashing point changefeeds unless we change the format to be consistent with range changefeeds.  Between that and the possible desire to add timestamps, I think maybe we should just do this before 1.16.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug -- how strongly are you opposed to talking about this so close to the deadling?"
