      "@nviennot having read your comment on the other issue you linked, I see the change you would like to make. I completely agree with your proposal. I deal with asynchronous operations all the time maintaining `Celluloid`; in my opinion your approach to handling that mode is appropriate to the domain.\r\n\r\nI need to try some things to see if a `Condition` is the best way, or if it is not better for `Future` to be used. But either would be supported by the upcoming `Multiplexer` feature set ( https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/issues/632 )"
