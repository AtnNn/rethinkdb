      "@wojons -- so what happened a few times for me was that an error was thrown because a document was malformed.\r\n\r\nWhen the error is thrown in the middle of a nested query, it can be a bit annoying to filter results and see where the error is. So in the case a field is missing, I just throw an error with the whole document using `r.error`.\r\n\r\nThat way I get the primary key of the offending document, and what the document is. And I can properly fix the document.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can happen to is that you get a type error (like \"expected X and got Y\").\r\nIf you don't immediately see the document that has type Y, you can just throw Y to see what it is and if it's what you were expecting."
