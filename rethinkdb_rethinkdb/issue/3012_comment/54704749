      "@danielmewes \r\n\r\nYou have the right Idea when the query is being evaulated it would see that there is a debug and then it would start counting things. filters would count the total number of docs that enter the docs that leave maybe some math stats for average min max per doc to process. pluck would how how many docs did not have any of the fields to be used maybe the math operations like ad and subtract may have the two orginal numbers before the math operation maybe if it had to do a int to double converse on divsion i mean the list goes on but it helps you know if you can clean up your data or what is going on behind the sense there are lots of users I am sure that just write queries and have no idea whats going on. Unless your a Database enthuiest how all of this works could go right over your head.\r\n\r\nThis is also useful since rethinkdb does not have a query plainer or an explain really yet. It allows it for at least one operation at a time."
