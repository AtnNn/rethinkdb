      "With NoBrainer, a couple of optimizations are done:\r\n- The database is used in soft durability\r\n- The databases/tables are created on demand\r\n- The existing tables are truncated before each test (and not dropped)\r\n- The test suite is ran in parallel by using multi processes. Each process uses its dedicated database to perform its tests. Each test run time is recorded, so that for the next run, the parallelization can be divided near optimally."
