      "> This actually slows down development time a lot -- it's more of an issue then building when working on most ReQL issues. (I just timed it, and make rb_polyglot alone takes ~2 minutes on Newton.)\r\n\r\nOn my laptop test `ql-py-polyglot` takes 12 mins, I guess the full suite will take much more time."
