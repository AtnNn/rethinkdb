      "@coffeemug That's exactly what we are doing (though for technical reasons we only free the coroutines the next time somebody spawns a new one on that thread).\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the query repeatedly reducing memory consumption every time @atnnn ran it, I don't think that coroutines can be the sole cause of this. \r\n\r\nA very wild guess is that it could have to do with memory fragmentation being reduced, as we re-allocate some data (e.g. a vector actually grows, but the fact that it's re-allocated allows tcmalloc to place it in a better location or something).\r\n\r\nMore investigation is required."
