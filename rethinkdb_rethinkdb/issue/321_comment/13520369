      "Not at the moment. @mglukhovsky was writing an application which was his first reql encounter. Every time something was unclear, he recorded it, and gave the list to me. I'm now moving the list over to github. All of this is protobuf improvements, so I don't want to think about it too much until we ship 1.4."
