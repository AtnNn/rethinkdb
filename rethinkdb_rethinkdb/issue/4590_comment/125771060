      "I am already working on this, and found a whole series of problems with the test \"driver\"s handling of error cases (and a couple of other issues). I have Python done, and am working on JavaScript now. Ruby will be after that.\r\n\r\nI suspect that some changes recently make us catch these cases, whereas before we were incorrectly dropping them. So far I am not finding real issues (so outside of testing issues)."
