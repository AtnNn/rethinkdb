        "On `next` we are getting a build failure in `npm` when fetching `browserify`. Looking manually at the `npm` registry `esprima-six` is no longer listed. My guess is that it is fairly old, since we are on version 3.24.13 of `browserify`, and the current is 12.0.1.\n\nI suspect that we need to move up the version of `browerify` to something more recent, but am not sure why it is currently limited to `max_browserify_version=3.24.13` (in `./configure`).\n\n@deontologician do you have any insight into why we are limiting this?\n"
