      "Only difference in javascript is that you'll translate all `[]` to `()` (so just that one around 'blob'), and then change the function syntax from `lambda x: ...` to `function(x){ return ... }` (make sure to return, that's important) If you have access to a newer version of node, you can use `x => ...` arrow functions. And you'll need to change snake_case to camelCase (e.g `concatMap`)\r\n\r\nWhen you call `.run(conn)` in javascript, you'll get a promise instead of it being synchronous like python"
