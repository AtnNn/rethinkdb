      "@carlskii The `Expected type OBJECT but found ARRAY` error probably means that the `blobs` field contains an array value, so you can't filter over it like this.\r\n\r\nI think the `concatMap` you had earlier is actually still necessary. \r\n\r\nIn Python, you would do the same thing like this:\r\n```py\r\nr.db('db').table(\"test2\").concat_map(lambda doc: doc[\"blobs\"]).filter({\"fingerprint\": \"123\", \"meta1\": {\"b\": \"bcd\"}}).run(conn)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe pathspec syntax is exactly the same as you can see."
