        "The latest release of `rethinkdb` on npmjs.com is `2.0.0-2`. Version `2.0.0` has already been released. Versions that are followed by a hyphen and additional text are *prerelease* versions which [*can not match* a dependency range that does not specify prerelease tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#prerelease-tags). This means that a library with a `peerDependencies` entry for a range of `rethinkdb` versions will **fail** on installing if the latest version of `rethinkdb` was added with `npm install --save rethinkdb`.\r\n\r\nReleases to the driver *need* to be specified as patch version bumps, if not minor or major ones."
