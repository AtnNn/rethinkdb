        "I'm getting this error when running `scripts/check_style.sh` on the branch `mlucy_max_changefeeds`:\n\n```\nRuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded\n```\n\n@mlucy briefly looked into this:\n\n>  this appears to be an actual bug. `IsRValueType` seems to be calling itself over and over again at `cpplint:3600`. (It isn't recursing legitimately; it's calling itself with the same arguments it was passed.) I spent a few minutes trying to fix it and didn't get anywhere (I'm not clear on why it's trying to recurse there). \n\nIt might be enough to update our cpplint copy, or possibly we should report this bug upstream to Google.\n"
