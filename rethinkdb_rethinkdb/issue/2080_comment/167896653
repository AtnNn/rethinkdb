      "Is there no way the dump, restore, export, import functionality can't make use of the user's chosen client driver? For instance I develop on Mac using Ruby. Would it not make sense for these commands to detect I'm using the Ruby client driver and use them? I understand that this functionality may have been written in Python, but can it be ported to Ruby, Java and Javascript?"
