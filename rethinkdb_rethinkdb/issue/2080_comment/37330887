      "I was almost sure that there was an issue about shipping the python driver with RethinkDB package on Ubuntu but I somehow can't find it -_-\r\nI think nothing prevent us from doing it.\r\n \r\nBeyond not having our users install `pip`, they could get the C++ implementation of protobuf without having to deal with the installation process (which can get really tricky) -- https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1868 would remove the need for the C++ backend though.\r\n\r\n@atnnn can probably confirm that."
