      "@neumino -- you wrote about this in a gist that's still locked up in my inbox, but I will open all relevant issues on github.\r\n\r\n@atnnn -- I don't think we should force people to install pip, but I think we should ship a custom copy of the driver with `export`. This way `export` would work out of the box, but people would still have to `pip install rethinkdb` to use the Python driver.\r\n\r\nIt's a little unwieldy, but because we're \"batteries includes\" I think it's something we should do."
