      "The best solution to this issue is to package and distribute the python driver, like @neumino mentioned. It has not been done yet because it is usually very easy to install pip and the python driver. For example, on gentoo I simply have to do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nemerge dev-python/pip\r\nsudo pip install rethinkdb\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should link to http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html from http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/python/\r\n\r\nForcing the installation of pip would be a bad idea, it would not play well with existing python environments or package managers."
