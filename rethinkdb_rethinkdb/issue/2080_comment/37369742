      "@coffeemug  `pip` is not required to install the python driver.\r\n\r\nI would have to check, but I think on OS X we would copy the compiled python driver to `/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/`\r\n\r\nIf users installed the python driver using both their package manager and `pip`, they might get two copies of it.\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky no. The `make install` rule that users can run when compiling from source is the same one that is used to build all the rethinkdb packages."
