      "It can definitely be ported, but the scripts are actually fairly complex. The *basic* implementation (to read from a table and write to a file) is obviously trivial, but the full command involves different formats, unicode bugs, various command-line options, concurrency, etc. Porting this functionality into three languages is a very non-trivial amount of effort, and arguably wouldn't get users very much in return."
