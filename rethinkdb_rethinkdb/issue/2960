        "I'm just getting started with RethinkDB, and it took me a while to figure out why `r.row('name')` wasn't working (only `r.row['name']` works in python).  The current error message is:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: 'ImplicitVar' object is not callable\n```\n\nI would recommend implementing `ImplicitVar.__call__` so that `r.row()` either behaves the same as `r.row[]` or shows a better error message.\n\nCheers,\nTim\n"
