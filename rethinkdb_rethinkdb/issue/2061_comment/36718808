      "I somehow can't think of a real use case where people would have to map do a datum.\r\n\r\nThe only case I can think of is when we want to map to `1` to perform a `count`, and since we have a `count` method, users shouldn't have to manually write a count.\r\nIt's useful to explain how map reduce work though."
