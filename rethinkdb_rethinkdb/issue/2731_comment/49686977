      "I believe @mlucy's idea is that there is a different, configurable, change list size limit; so you say `r.table('foo').changes(limit=50).run()` and it won't spam you with more than 50 lines at a time or something.  This could affect correctness, so I'm not sold on the idea; but on the other hand protocol storms because somebody asked for changes and then stopped listening for a while could be bad."
