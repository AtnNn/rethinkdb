      "We should discuss this when it's scheduled, but I'm going to add a comment on it so I don't forget how I feel about it later.\r\n\r\nI think controlling the changefeed queue depth via the array limit is confusing (to me as a user). The change feed queue depth feels like an internal operational argument that's fundamentally different from the array size limit. It just so happens that it's implemented internally via the same mechanism, but I don't know that as a user."
