      "@jamescostian i will take a stab at your question here but someone else may have to correct me.\r\n\r\n1. yes the two servers will have the same data eventually it will follow an eventaul constancy this is assuming you have the write ack set to 1. there for the master will accept the write but the secondray may not have the write or put it to disk yet.\r\n\r\n2. for how out of data that is really interesting and could depends mostly on how busy the secondary is. I dont know what the rethinkdb limit is before it sets a secondray into backfill state for being so out of date"
