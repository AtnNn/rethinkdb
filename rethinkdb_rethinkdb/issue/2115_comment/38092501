      "Ok! It looks like it was a combination of two issues above. The first one (range query latency) should be fixed in the upcoming 1.12 release.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there isn't very much we (or anyone) could do about the second issue. If you're connecting to a replica and want up-to-date results, the replica has to go to the master to get the result, and since they're in different data centers, you have to pay the latency cost with the query.\r\n\r\nHere is what I'd like to do:\r\n\r\n* We'll keep this issue open and we'll retest after 1.12 is out, just to be sure\r\n* I've opened a separate issue (https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/224) to document cross-datacenter latency issues, so people understand them better\r\n\r\nThanks again for your detailed report!"
