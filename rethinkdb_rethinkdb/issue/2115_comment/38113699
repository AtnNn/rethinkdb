      "@coffeemug I would just like to ask 2 questions:\r\n\r\n1. if I have 2 servers, each on a different data center, and a table's \"replicas\" is set to 2, then both servers would have the same data - right?\r\n2. If I use `useOutdated` in my queries, how outdated should I expect my results to be?"
