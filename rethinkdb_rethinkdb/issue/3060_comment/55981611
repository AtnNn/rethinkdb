      "I have a slight preference for {latitude: ..., longitude:...} because it makes things clear what is what.\r\nI'm fine with `[latitude, longitude]` too.\r\nIf we keep `[longitude, latitude]` in the pseudo type, we should swap latitude/longitude in all the commands.\r\n\r\nIf we keep an object, {latitude: ..., longitude}, we can also add an optarg to automatically coerce things to geojson like documents ([longitude, latitude]) -- as long as the default is consistent with the commands.\r\n\r\nAs long as users are not going to run into a problem with their second query, that works for me."
