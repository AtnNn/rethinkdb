      "This seems bad to me.  If I remember correctly we currently have the property that geometry pseudotypes are plain geoJSON (plus the $reql_type$ field), which is really nice.  That means that e.g. if you have a database dump you can easily get the geoJSON out of it.\r\n\r\nI think we shouldn't do this.  If we don't like the inconsistency, I would rather switch to `longitude, latitude` ordering for all our commands.  We went with `lat, long` because http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/ says to, but plenty of systems (including geoJSON) use `long, lat`."
