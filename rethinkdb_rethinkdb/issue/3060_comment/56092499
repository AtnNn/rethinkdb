      "@danielmewes, I like the idea of having a more efficient internal representation (if we aren't going to be using strict GeoJSON).  My only concern with that is if we want to change the format in the future (say, to include `altitude`), but we could get around that using the serialization version, I suppose.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I have no strong opinion either way, but it looks like the discussion is leaning towards 'make terms long, lat, and keep the format as GeoJSON'.  It would help if we could reach a consensus so that I can get this in and stop blocking the release."
