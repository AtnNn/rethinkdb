      "I also think we should stick with @Tryneus's fix (I realize I changed my mind on this from my comment before). Flipping long/lat in all commands is a lot of work -- we'd have to change the code, and the tests, and the docs -- for what IMO is questionable gain.\r\n\r\nI think not maintaining geoJSON compatibility in our reql type representation is fine. The user would have to do *something* to get geo json anyway (either call `geojson` or `without('__reql_type__')`), and I think it's better to do the former and be a bit more explicit in the format.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I think any solution is equally good/bad, so I'd go for work minimization, and given that @Tryneus already did the fix, I'd just go with that. The alternatives don't seem much better."
