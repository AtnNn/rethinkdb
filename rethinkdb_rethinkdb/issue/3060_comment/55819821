      "Here is how I see it:\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n- Makes everything less confusing.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n- The other way is already done. Redoing last minute will delay the release.\r\n- Incompatible with geojson (not that we have to be for ptypes, but it's a nice property).\r\n- Will somewhat blow up the size of the objects. This can add up for large sequences.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should do it for 1.15 -- I think we should ship as is, and consider fixing it later if we discover it confuses a lot of people. Also, we might be able to fix it via a short troubleshooting entry. Would you be opposed to trying it this way?"
