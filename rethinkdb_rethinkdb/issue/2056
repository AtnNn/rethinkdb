        "Our interface for updating arrays inside an object is very clunky. Consider a sample document from a table `posts` with an array of comments:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  post_id: ...,\r\n  text: ...,\r\n  comments: [ { comment_id: ..., comment_text: ...}, ... ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuppose the user wants to find a comment with a particular id (in a post with a particular id), and update the comment's text. I can proceed to type up a query to do it, but it's obviously extremely annoying (too annoying for me to type it up, in fact).\r\n\r\nThe same problem applies if we want to delete a particular comment, or do any kind of modification to the array. I don't quite know what an elegant way to solve this is. Leaving in subsequent for now."
