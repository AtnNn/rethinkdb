      "Hi @philips,\r\nthanks for the report.\r\n\r\nOne thing to check is whether there are any \"heartbeat timeout\" messages in the log of the machine from which some tables were unavailable.\r\n\r\nAnother possible cause for this could be an issue we have just fixed in our development branch (#2702) that affected metadata propagation, and made it occasionally miss a change. The fix will ship very soon with RethinkDB 1.14.\r\n\r\nHowever there could also be something else going on here.\r\n\r\n@philips Can you tell us a bit more about the context in which this happened? Were any of the machines in the cluster restarted before this happened? If yes, was the affected machine (that kept showing the tables as unavailable) one of them?\r\nOr were the tables available before and then suddenly became unavailable on this machine in the middle of normal operation?\r\n\r\nPinging @timmaxw , he might have additional ideas."
