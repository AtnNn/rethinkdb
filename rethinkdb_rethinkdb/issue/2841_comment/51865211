      "I don't see any uses of a `cross_thread_watchable_t` in the part of the code that's writing the log messages (`network_logger_t`), nor in the code that's handling semilattice and directory changes before they get to the network logger. That makes it unlikely that this is caused - at least directly - by #2702."
