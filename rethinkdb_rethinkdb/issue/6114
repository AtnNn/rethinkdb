        "since there are a LOT of redhat / fedora/ centos users, there should be a good install system for these OS's.  \nthe rethinkdb repositories for fedora /centos install the db okay but need to be improved \n1) should provide a systemd setup.   Here is a file based on arch but does not work since path locations  need to be different \n[Unit]\nDescription=RethinkDB database server\n[Service]\nUser=rethinkdb\nGroup=rethinkdb\nExecStart=/usr/bin/rethinkdb serve --config-file /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d/%i.conf\nKillMode=process\nPrivateTmp=true\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n2) on the fedora install, rethinkdb is not located at /usr/bin  - we did locate an executable at /etc/init.d but not sure if that is the right location for this file for Fedora/Centos - don't think so.  \n3) the install should setup a default data directory - not sure but something like /var/data seems right\n4)  the install should provide for multiple instances since many developers will want to use them - again the /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d does not seem to be the right location for Fedora/Centos - perhaps a Fedora packager could help with the appropriate locations\n"
