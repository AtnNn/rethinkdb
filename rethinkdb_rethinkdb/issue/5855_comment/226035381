      "Hi Ondrej,\n\nsomeone just asked almost the same question on GitHub in\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5856 .\n\nI'd like to continue the discussion there so that we have it in one place\nif you don't mind.\n\nAssuming you ran into this issue independently, you can take a look at my\nreply on the GitHub thread and comment on the questions I asked there so we\ncan find out why this is happening in your case.\n\n- Daniel\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 14, 2016 at 3:37 AM, Ondrej Forda <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Server version: rethinkdb 2.2.4~0trusty (GCC 4.8.2)\n> Client version: 2.2.0-3\n>\n> We have a large rethinkdb database that we backup daily. We use the dump\n> command for that. When the dump command runs, which takes around 20-40\n> minutes, the server becomes unresponsive. Otherwise the server runs just\n> fine.
