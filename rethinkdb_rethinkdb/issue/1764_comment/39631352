      "I think that to solve #1152 we'd need an optarg for `eqJoin` (e.g. `{type: 'outer' }`). It would be pretty easy to add, but we _are_ at the end of the ReQL discussion period, and I'd prefer to have more time to discuss the proposal. So I think we should do #1152 separately (but it's up to @mlucy).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn a related note, I think joins in general need a bit of an overhaul given everything we've learned. In particular, I think that instead of returning pairs of documents, we should return a document with an array of joined documents (though what to do for indexes over the array size?), drop the `zip` command, possibly *only* allowed indexed joins, etc. But we should discuss this after 1.13 is done."
