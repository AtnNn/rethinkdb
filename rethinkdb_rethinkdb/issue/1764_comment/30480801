      "@neumino -- so arrays actually work (primary keys can be arrays, but not objects).\r\n\r\nI think that we should eventually support objects as primary keys, but in the meantime, I think joins should drop rows that can't be compared. I agree with @jakcharlton and don't think there is much benefit to throwing here.\r\n\r\n@jakcharlton -- we'll try to iron out the details and schedule this fix for 1.13. Thanks for reporting this!"
