      "In @jakcharlton case, if no contact is found, we drop the document from the `others` table.\r\nSo it would be consistent to drop the `other` document if the field `contact_id` doesn't exist\r\n.\r\nBy the way, now if the field is set to `null`, the `eqJoin` is going to throw.\r\nThe same goes for objects and arrays, but I'm more ok with that."
