      "@geddski Well that whole paragraph is more of an outlook. Realtime analytics for example also aren't available yet.\r\n\r\nFor the upcoming version RethinkDB 2.4, we decided to do realtime analytics first, or more specifically changefeeds on reductions, sums, counts and averages. See the last few comments in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1118 ).\r\nChangefeeds on joins will be the next step after that.\r\n\r\nI realize this has been taking longer than we had originally hoped, due to other things getting in the way, but be assured that changefeeds on joins are still very high on our priority list."
