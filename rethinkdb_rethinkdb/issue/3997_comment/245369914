      "@xfg This is ultimately a question of the API. However subqueries are extremely flexible, and we will not be able to map all uses of subqueries onto the algorithm (I think). It might well end up requiring the use of a special join command, not unlike `eqJoin`, though we would like to modernize the API for that as a part of this. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2720 has a proposal of a potential improved API for joins that we are considering. It will probably make some uses of subqueries unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe details of this aren't clear yet, since we haven't spent enough times on investigating the API-side of this so far."
