      "@xfg The current solution would be to have a changefeed on the `user` document in your application, and whenever it changes its current room, you just open a new changefeed on the `chat` table. You cannot currently do it in a single query, but it shouldn't be necessary.\r\nIf you need more help with this, I suggest asking on our Slack channel (http://slack.rethinkdb.com / https://rethinkdb.slack.com), as how to do this specifically is unrelated to the question in this issue.\r\n\r\nWith the \"changefeed on join\" feature, a changefeed like that could be written in a single query I think."
