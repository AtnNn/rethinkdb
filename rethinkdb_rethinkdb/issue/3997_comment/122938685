      "This is a bit off topic, but @geddski -- unless I'm misunderstanding something I don't think you need to call `map` followed by a `merge` -- you can just call `merge` directly since it works fine on streams and sequences. Should make your query a bit shorter :smile: \r\n\r\nAlso, it will get even shorter when we implement #2721 (you'll be able to drop `coerceTo` parts, which will be nice)."
