      "@danielmewes Thanks for your answer, but I don't understand how to use rethinkdb chagefeeds for real life projects.\r\n\r\nAny task outside syntactic examples leads to pain. For example how to get chat messages for room within which is user? What will if the user will change the current room to another?\r\n\r\nHe still will receive the chat messages for the old room, but not for new room.  That is within changefeed necessary to use data from the two or more tables, for my example this is `chat` table and `user` table and when the user's room is changed then the user should receive messages only for his new room.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('chat')\r\n  .filter(r.row('room').eq(r.table('user').get(id).getField('room')))\r\n  .changes();\r\n```\r\nOr something similar. This is 99% real life tasks. But now it's unreal."
