      "We generally don't want to try and branch behavior on what OS we are on, but rather do it on capabilities. This case exposes why: it is not directly that you are on MacOS X, but rather base don what version of OpenSSL you are compiling against. So a better fix for the first bit of this problem would be to use:\r\n```\r\n#ifdef SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1\r\n    long ssl_options = SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2|SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3|SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1|SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1;\r\n#else\r\n    long ssl_options = SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2|SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3|SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1;\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have had internal conversations a few times about how to better handle OpenSSL, including options both to remove it completely or require it to always be \"our\" version. I don't think we ever got to consensus though."
