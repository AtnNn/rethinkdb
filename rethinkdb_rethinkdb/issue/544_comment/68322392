      "Once we have a query pretty-printer for the `jobs` system table, this would become pretty easy to do and would probably be worth it.\r\n\r\nA much nicer interface would be allowing for non-squashing changefeeds on the `jobs` table, but that might be more work. With the current implementation, you would miss some queries in a changefeed on that table because it would be implicitly squashing."
