      "Now that we have the `rethinkdb.jobs` table, we can add that information to it with #3636.  Then, if we make changefeeds on the `jobs` table not poll (and potentially miss short-running queries), it would be trivial to implement a query log in an arbitrary client using:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nr.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').filter(r.row['id'][0].eq('query')).changes(squash=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could even integrate it into the Web UI or data explorer.  Of course, we might want to filter out the web UI's requests to avoid spam."
