      "At first I was thinking that having traditional log levels (debug, info, warning, critical) would be the best thing, but the debug level always seems to fill up with so many statements that it becomes practically useless.\r\n\r\nWhat might better to keep the messages focused and in scope is a series of flags such as --log-query, --log-connection.  Although that probably won't scale very well as more items are logged.\r\n\r\nAlso, while I'm describing these as command line queries, I think it would be very useful if they could be toggled during runtime and not by relaunching the server."
