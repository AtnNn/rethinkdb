      "Is it currently possible to filter the output of `r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').changes()` to only include jobs from the current client or do we have to wait on something like #4519?\r\n\r\nThe `info.client_port` property appears to be unique across clients, but is it possible to obtain that information from the driver?"
