      "Thanks for the report.\r\n\r\nIt looks like stretch upgraded to libssl1.0.2. We probably need to update our build environment to make it build against a newer version of the library.\r\nI'll do that for the upcoming RethinkDB 2.3.0.\r\n\r\nFor now you can probably build from source: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/debian/"
