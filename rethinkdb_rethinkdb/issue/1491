        "When building the RPM package I ran into a few problems:\r\n\r\n* [x] There is no libtermcap.a to statically link with on centos, libtinfo.a can be used instead.\r\n* [x] The generated RPM file does not contain the architecture (x86_64 or i686)\r\n* [x] The rules for re2 are broken. The make step always fails and I have to `rm -rf build/release/re2 && make re2 && !!`\r\n* ~~It does not build a rethinkdb-dbg package with debugging symbols (like on ubuntu)~~"
