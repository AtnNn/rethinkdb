      "Oh sorry\nIt is Ubuntu Xenial \nRethinkDB was 2.3.2\nI upgraded each node first to 2.3.3 and then to 2.3.4. \nNo crash since. FYI it's the second time 1 node crashed this way. Thankfully I have a 4 shards / 3 replica setup.\n\nAnthony\n\n> On Jun 10, 2016, at 12:03 AM, Daniel Mewes <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> Thanks for reporting this bug @devlounge . Which version of RethinkDB is this with, and which platform are you running on (operating system, distribution, architecture)?
