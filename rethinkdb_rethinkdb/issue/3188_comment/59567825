      "We should definitely support this, but it's a little bit tricky.  We currently cheat a bit for `asc` and `desc` and just have `order_by` examine its arguments to see if any of them are calls to those two.  We could fix this by adding more special-case logic.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this code wouldn't work for another reason: we don't let people store functions in arrays, and `r.args([r.row('x')])` tries to store a function in an array before parsing it back out with `r.args`."
