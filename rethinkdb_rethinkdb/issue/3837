        "I am running rethinkdb in a docker container, using boot2docker on a mac, using the go driver `gorethink` I can reproduce a crash. Below is the log of the db on crash. Is this something that you guys want to investigate? I can privately send you my code. \r\nAlso my rethinkdb version `rethinkdb 1.16.2+1~0trusty (GCC 4.8.2)` \r\nand this is my arch `Linux rethinkdb 3.18.5-tinycore64 #1 SMP Sun Feb 1 06:02:30 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux` [inside the container of course]\r\n\r\nAlso I understand that I need to find a way to mount my data volume that supports the syc api or whatever it is that is rethinkdb is complaining about. any guidance for that is also appreciated.\r\n\r\n``` log\r\n2015-02-26T12:33:15.723886942Z warn: Parent directory of log file (/data/rethinkdb_data/log_file) could not be synced.
