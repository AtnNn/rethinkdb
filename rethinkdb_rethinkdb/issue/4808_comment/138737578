      "By writes happening, I believe it was only during indexing and it's probably the writes for the index itself I presume.  I'm running a new rebuild right now and have a series of screenshots I'm taking.  I'll upload the first batch here.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have them in a decent order, every 5-10 mins I'm capturing htop from both nodes (node1 on top, 2 on bottom) and what the web UI shows.  The first web UI screenshot shows the inactivity of the table before starting.  I also restarted the rethinkdb process on both systems to start as clean as possible, that is reflected in the first console screenshot.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I've tried to rebuild after having the data split between 2 servers, and it looks like it may complete based on how quickly it's running.  It looks like the memory consumption is on a slow climb though.  I'll have more screenshots shortly.\r\n\r\n![table-before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4692885/9750515/f5e55954-5666-11e5-823d-45c0e49717c6.png)\r\n![servers-before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4692885/9750517/f5e5c4ca-5666-11e5-99e7-7d695dd9e472.png)\r\n![table-just-started](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4692885/9750519/f5e67a78-5666-11e5-8127-2a41fd8cdbde.png)\r\n![servers-just-started](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4692885/9750518/f5e64b70-5666-11e5-9107-f4ea1880dc31.png)\r\n![servers-2mins-in](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4692885/9750516/f5e57bb4-5666-11e5-82eb-f319b6af1e1d.png)\r\n![table-2mins-in](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4692885/9750520/f5e6913e-5666-11e5-9756-b215e5133583.png)\r\n![servers-15mins-in](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4692885/9750522/f5eeacca-5666-11e5-9027-714db6941774.png)\r\n![table-15mins-in](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4692885/9750521/f5eeb080-5666-11e5-8b9d-41a6c46adc67.png)\r\n"
