      "It definitely looks like we're snapshotting everything during a secondary index construction.\r\nI think this might become an even bigger problem if someone migrates multiple indexes on the same table, and one of them finishes first and causes the old index to get deleted. In that case the remaining index construction would force the creation of a full snapshot of the old index, which would be kept in memory.\r\n\r\nSo in any case I'm going to limit the snapshotting to the primary btree.\r\nI'm also going to try to reproduce the specific issue @bgardner87 ran into, and see if that would be solved by the same change as well."
