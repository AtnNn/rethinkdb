      "I'm closing this since it looked like this was mainly a memory consumption issue.\r\nRethinkDB 2.2 came with a redesign of secondary index construction logic and it also reduced the general memory overhead for large data sets.\r\n\r\n@bgardner87 please let me know if there are still any issues that we need to look into."
