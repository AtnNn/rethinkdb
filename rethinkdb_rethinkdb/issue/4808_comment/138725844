      "Ok, the writes could theoretically explain the memory consumption, assuming there were enough of them.\r\nThe reason for this is that secondary index construction in its current implementation uses an in-memory snapshot of the table, so all data modifications that happen during the index construction will be kept in cache.\r\nWe have started working on a solution for this in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2134 , but it hasn't made it in yet (it's a relatively big change)."
