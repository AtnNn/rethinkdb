      "I don't know if this is related, but I am working towards a 3 node + proxy deployment and have added the 3rd node tonight.  During rebalancing, I'm having similar issues and the servers are running out of memory and crashing in rotation.  I've dropped the cache size back to default, so that will take affect on the next round of reboots and I'll see if that helps keep things alive.\r\n\r\nIn either case, it may not just be index rebuilding, right now the only thing happening is backfilling.  I've set the large table to 3 shards with 3 replicas."
