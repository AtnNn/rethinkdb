        "When a table is resharded (e.g. via `table.reconfigure`) all changefeeds connected to that table are reconfigured. There is a issue to not disconnect feeds that only access shards that are not changing (#3547), but it would also be nice to not have these feeds disconnect at all. There are internal reasons why we currently do this, but not ones that are easy to describe to end-users.\r\n\r\nNote that this is similar to [Sharding while keeping docs available. (#1774)](#1774), but might well be completed independently of that effort."
