        "We include the core of the `biplist` project as part of our `.dmg` building code. Back when I was working on this I submitted some improvements to this code, mostly to make sure that it worked on Python3. That submission was not immediately accepted, so I only took a few changes that we needed, but left the rest. My pull request has recently been accepted, along with some other changes. So we should update to keep in sync. Nothing at all urgent here.\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/wooster/biplist\n"
