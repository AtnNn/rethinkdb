      "Before we pick a new name, perhaps we should clarify the semantics. @mlucy could you enlighten us?\r\n\r\nI was under the impresion that it is just a map that combines the results by adding numbrs and concating arrays.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> r.expr([{a:1,b:[2]}, {a:3, b:[4,5]}]).forEach(r.row)\r\n{\"a\":4,\"b\":[2,4,5]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever this behaviour has always been closely assciated with write operations, and the docs only say \"Loop over a sequence, evaluating the given write query for each element\".\r\n\r\nhttp://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/for_each/"
