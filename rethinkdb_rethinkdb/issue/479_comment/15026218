      "The configure and packaging steps are currently not separate because the dependencies can change when building with different ./configure options.\r\n\r\nThe rpm make target was bitrotted and did not work anymore, so it was removed. The make deb target does not work either and should be removed as well. The build-deb-src target builds a dsc file with the configure flags that are specified in `packaging/debian/control`.\r\n\r\nFor anyone else reading, a workaround for specifying the version is to put the version string in a file called `VERSION.OVERRIDE` at the top ot the source tree:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho 2.7.9 > VERSION.OVERRIDE\r\n```"
