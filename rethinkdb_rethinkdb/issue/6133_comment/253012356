      "well the good news i was able to get rethinkdb running when i booted my mac into safe mode. outside of safe mode still having the same problems as above.. that points to a system issue and not a rethinkdb issue. Any ideas on what i can do to debug the system differences for OS X in and outside of safe mode? "
