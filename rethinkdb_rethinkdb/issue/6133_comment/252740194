      "This is very surprising. If something was corrupted in the existing data directory, that could explain such a crash. But it crashing even on a new directory is extremely weird.\r\n\r\nYou said that you were running it fine before. Was that on the same machine?\r\n\r\nIs there anything special about your setup? Anything that changed recently?\r\nAre you using disk encryption?\r\n\r\nMaybe try running with `--no-update-check`, though I doubt that that's the issue."
