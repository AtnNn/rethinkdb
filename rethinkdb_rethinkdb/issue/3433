        "Currently `tolower` and `toupper` assume an 8 bit encoding and only convert ASCII letters (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/874 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1745 ).\r\n\r\nThere are two degrees to which we can fix this:\r\n* Make `tolower`/`toupper` UTF-8 aware, but still only transform characters that are in ASCII. If a single byte in a multi-byte UTF-8 character happens to correspond to a letter in ASCII, these terms are currently going to modify it with probably undesired effects on the multi-byte character that the byte is part of. (@gchpaco: or is there something in the details of UTF-8 that makes this impossible to happen?)\r\nIf we do this, `tolower`/`toupper` would still not work on special characters, but at least they wouldn't destroy them in unpredictable ways.\r\n* Make `tolower`/`toupper` actually recapitalize Unicode characters. This will require some sort of `locale` opt arg, and would probably mean using an external library such as ICU."
