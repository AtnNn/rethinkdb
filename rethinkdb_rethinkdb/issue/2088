        "I know i know stupid idea. I am thinking about some of the optimizations that could take place for hard drives over ssd. Since everything right now is appened only and and indexes end up all over the file. @danielmewes  has explained there are a few types of data like the indexes, the docs if its to large to fit in the index super blocks and i guess a few other things. To be able to keep reads squanal for spinning disk drives being able to rewrite some of the smaller files would help improve. For example for indexes after some period of time it can rewrite the index to disk again depends on thee size of the index but it can slowly start to sort it takese a block of the index and sorts it and then writes it it could be in 4k chunks or something and then it can take 2 4k chunks and rewrite it or something this way it gets a little better. And out of memory index reads would not be as slow\r\n\r\nI know that having something like this before LTS sounds crazy but would be better to get this done before lts instead of after words. when everyone would have to rebuild the cluster another option is to have both normal and this and let the user decide on table creation."
