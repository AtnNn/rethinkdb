If I hit TAB in this scenario, it does nothing.\r\n\r\n```\r\nset durability 3b_ --soft\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe cursor is denoted by underscore. If I hit TAB in this scenario, it jumps the cursor to the end of the line.\r\n\r\nIdeally, tab completion would just work as expected even if we aren't completing the last thing typed. The next best thing is to do nothing when the user hits TAB, but that has to be consistent.\r\n\r\nLow priority, obviously."
