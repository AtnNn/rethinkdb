      "The `DiskBackedQueue` test creates files `test_disk_backed_queue` and `test_disk_backed_queue.create` I believe. I cannot see from the code right now which directory those are created in (maybe the current directory?).\r\nNote that those files are almost immediately unlinked after they've been created though.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could run `strace` with some filter on it to find out where it puts those files?\r\n\r\nSome other unit tests probably also create similar files, but I don't have a complete list."
