      "@srh, yes, it does exist only at daniel_2168 because that is where the bad commit comes from.\r\n\r\nIf I am not mistaken, this branch will be merged to next in final. If that issue remains unsolved while being merged to next, we will meet that issue again.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why I made such a testing framework to catch build, test and even performance regression __as early as possible__ so that then can be fixed before merging to next. Then next branch will always in good shape."
