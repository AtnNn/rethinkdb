      "@Aleaxander -- we generally have the culture of breaking everything in private branches, and then retesting before merging into next. If something's broken in next (or other release branches), it's a problem, but if something's broken in someone's private branch, it could be for a variety of reasons and most of the time is ok. Private branches can be all kinds of broken, we just commit to those often and are perfectly ok with committing code in intermediary states."
