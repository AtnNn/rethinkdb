      "Welcome :)\r\n\r\nBTW, I don't know you guys working style for fixing such issues. For issues only exist at none official branch(next branch in this example), I'd suggest to fold the fix in one commit(or even rebase) so that we will leave no broken build while merged to next branch, thus it will not break \"git bisect\", which would be very useful.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, it's just an suggestion and you guys may have more proper reason if you guys keep the fix in a single commit, as I already saw them in git history."
