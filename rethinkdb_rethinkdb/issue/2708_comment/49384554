      "I think this is related to #1738. I know you guys are reworking the cluster API at the moment, so probably this fits into that.. I come from the Riak world where I have great cluster support for available/unavailable nodes. In Riak, however, I don't configure my cluster in a config file, nodes are joined together _after_ startup."
