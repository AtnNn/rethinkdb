The output was `Done (0 seconds)`, which is naturally quite confusing. We should find a way to improve this use case.\n\nI think we should just print an informative error message that briefly explains what went wrong and gives a suggestion on how to import (i.e. concatenate the files, or import one file at a time).\n\n@Tryneus -- what do you think?\n"
