      "Ok saw your comment on that now:\r\n> I think you're right. In the extend method, we call maybeContinue before we parse the response into json, since we want to parallelize parsing and the server getting the next batch ready. But in the constructor of the cursor, we've already had to parse the response to find out we need to create a cursor at all, so we always know the cursor response type before sending the continue query.\r\n\r\nSo I agree that we should change it to save the extra continue for such queries. Probably not a high priority though.\r\n\r\nI'm also going to add the Python tag, since I suspect that we're doing the same thing there?"
