      "For those watching this issue, this almost certainly won't happen until Rethink hits 2.0 -- sorry. Between UUID and upcoming date support, people should be able to find workarounds for almost every use case. While additional generation schemes are really nice, unfortunately there are much more important things we have to do first.\r\n\r\nIf you run into a use case where this is a real showstopper, please let us know and we'll see if we can reprioritize."
