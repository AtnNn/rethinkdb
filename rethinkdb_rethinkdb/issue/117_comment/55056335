      "I think we should allow multiple pkey autogeneration schemes as follows: `insert` takes an optarg `pkey_gen` that can be either a string specifying a preset strategy or a function of 0 arguments that's called once per row (so someone could write `r.now().coerce_to('string') + r.uuid` if they wanted).\r\n\r\n@coffeemug -- could you come up with a list of pkey generation schemes people actually want?"
