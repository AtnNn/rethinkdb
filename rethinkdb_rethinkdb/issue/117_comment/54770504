      "What's the scope of this issue?\r\nAnd what's the use case?\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople are used to have incremental integers from MySQL, but that's mostly because they do not have partitions.\r\n\r\nIf users want primary keys that are sorted, they could use `r.now()` right? If they are worried about collisions, they could also do `r.now().add(r.uuid())`.\r\n\r\nIf users want more human-readeable ids, maybe we should have shorted uuids that we can convert in base 10 like Google Plus have?\r\n\r\nShould we wait for hash shards before having incremental uuids?"
