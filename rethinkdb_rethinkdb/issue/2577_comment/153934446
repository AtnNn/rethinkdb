      "@ember-max I just tested this myself and I see what you're saying. It appears that there is no way to get out of a `cursor.each()` iteration once you close the cursor since the `callback` is not called with an error *and* the optional `onFinishedCallback` is never called. It does work if you close the underlying connection, though.\r\n\r\nEven if the `cursor` fired an `end` event it wouldn't help because you can't use the `EventEmitter` and iterator APIs simultaneously."
