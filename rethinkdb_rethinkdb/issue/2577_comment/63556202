      "Ok just checked the code. We are still only emitting `'error'` and `'data'` events in the official driver.\r\n\r\nIf you need an `'end'` event, one way to work around it right now is by using `each()`, which does allow specifying an `onFinishedCallback` ( http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/each/ ).\r\n\r\nI'm going to move it to 1.16-polish. We can add the new event type if there's time at the end.\r\n(either @Tryneus or @deontologician should pick it up once you are done with `reql-admin` and other critical 1.16 work)"
