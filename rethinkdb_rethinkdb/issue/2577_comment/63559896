      "The reason I opened this issue was to have an event to know when a cursor would release a connection.\r\n\r\nUsers probably shouldn't use it to iterate through a cursor since it is not a feed (and for feeds, there is not really an \"end\" event)\r\n\r\nAbout detecting the end of the cursor, mongo returns a row `null`, which doesn't work with RethinkDB since you could get a stream when `null` is a valid value. Returning `undefined` for both `error` and `document` could work, but this is a trick and doesn't seem like a good idea because:\r\n- It's unconventional\r\n- It will break if one day RethinkDB support an \"undefined\" type\r\n\r\nCode error would make things nicer though."
