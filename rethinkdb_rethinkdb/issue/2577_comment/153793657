      "(posted on #3702 as well, apologies if this is redundant but they seem related)\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to close/cancel a cursor \"externally,\" i.e., by some means other than the callback which is supplied directly, ideally without even relying on my callback having been called at all. There is obviously `cursor.close()`, but that doesn't seem to invoke the cursor's `onFinishedCallback`, and I'm worried that something isn't getting properly cleaned up. Ensuring that `cursor.close()` invoked any kind of `done` event, as well as calling any supplied `onFinishedCallback` would work for me, assuming I'm going about this the right way."
