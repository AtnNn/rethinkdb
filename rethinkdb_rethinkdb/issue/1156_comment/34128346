      "I think for printing out the log file, we could easily do that inside rethinkdb (and probably should).\r\n\r\nFor implementing default behavior for `pid-file` and `directory` options, we could certainly do this in the server if those options are not present in a config file, but I'm not entirely sure we should.  Is there a valid use case for launching rethinkdb with a config file, but not using the init script?  Should we have different behaviors in each case?"
