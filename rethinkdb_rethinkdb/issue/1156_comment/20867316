      "Intuitively, I have a slightly negative reaction to the overall proposal -- I think it's a lot of work that would change the experience quite significantly, and would take some time to get right. I think the current changes that were implemented (better comments in the example config script, rethink accepting options it doesn't understand, etc.) get us 99% of the way there. We should see how people feel about these changes, but I suspect they're good enough (tm)."
