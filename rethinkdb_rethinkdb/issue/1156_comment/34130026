      "Apache has `apachectl`, Postgresql has `pg_ctl` and nginx has `nginx -s`.\r\n\r\nHaving all the logic in the init script is not portable: only our ubuntu packages use the init script. The OS X, Centos and the arch and other community packages do not use the init script and have their own method of starting and managing rethinkdb instances."
