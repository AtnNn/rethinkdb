      "Users on all platforms except ubuntu launch rethinkdb without an init script, many of them use config files. A few users have reported trying to test their config files on ubuntu by doing `rethinkdb --config-file /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d/instance.conf` and being confused because the data directory was set to `./rethinkdb_data`"
