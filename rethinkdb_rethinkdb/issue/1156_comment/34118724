      "I just talked to @tryneus about this. We agree that the init script should not be parsing the config file. Here is what it does with the config file:\r\n\r\n- It reads the `pid-file`, `runuser`, `rungroup`, `directory` and `log-file` options\r\n- It uses the base name of the file as the instance name\r\n- If the `pid-file` option is not present, it sets it to `/var/run/rethinkdb/<instance name>/pid_file` and creates that directory if it doesn't exist, chowning it to `<runuser>:<rungroup>`\r\n- It does the same for the `directory`, but in `/var/lib/rethinkdb/<instance name>`\r\n- It prints out the path to the log file when starting rethinkdb\r\n\r\nThat behaviour needs to be removed or implemented by rethinkdb itself."
