      "I've finally narrowed this down to something potentially useful: after tons of trial and error on the app side, I spun up a DO server with a publicly available RethinkDB instance, and pointed the tests to it. All tests passed on both CI hosts. I suspect they are only giving the test suite a pint-sized single core VM with almost no ram, so I can't even consider this a bug.\r\n\r\nIn case anyone else finds themselves here: If you're doing lots of complex queries in your tests and they get stuck on your CI server... spin up a DB somewhere else."
