      "@danielmewes that still screws over people who have set their `cache_sizes` at levels that work well and suddenly have the meanings change. Also if we just multiply the default value by a factor of `4` it doesn't make users of the default value that much less likely to hit the oom killer. There's simply no way to change the meaning of this value without risking making in production admins lives harder and they're by far the most valuable users we have. If this was a change we have to make now or risk having it be unintuitive indefinitely I would definitely agree. But with a much much better solution coming soon. One that isn't going to make anyone's life tougher like this one will it just doesn't make sense."
