      "I don't think there's much reason to fix this. Even if it's not in a point release it's going to be at least a minor annoyance when suddenly their tables are using less memory and performing worse and it's going to become moot once we have the cache changes in place. There really isn't much upside to fixing this right now and there's a clear cost.\r\n\r\nAlso I don't think this was done by mistake. The cache size was always meant to be a per shard setting. You can certain claim this isn't the most intuitive definition but changing it right now and then changing it again a month from now is probably not going to make things much less confusing at this point."
