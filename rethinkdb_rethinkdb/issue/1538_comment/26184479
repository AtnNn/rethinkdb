      "The new solution isn't going to have a cache limit for tables at all. Also this is harder than you think it is and the solution you've proposed won't have the effect you're claiming it will. Again, it isn't worth doing this to give users a month of a slightly better behavior until we change the behavior again. Especially since no one has complained about it."
