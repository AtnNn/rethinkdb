      "Well, then we can just set the new default cache size to 4096 MB. People will probably have to re-import their data anyway, which wipes any cache_size settings. The behavior will be exactly the same, except that if a user adjusts the cache size manually, what they get is a lot closer to what they probably expect to get.\r\n\r\nAll range shards of a given table use the same CPU_SHARDING_FACTOR caches in the background, don't they?"
