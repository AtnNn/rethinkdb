      "Hmm, it actually might have the correct affect. How do we handle cache size for range shards?\r\n\r\nI still think that this is going to make more users lives worse rather than better. People using rethink in production have cache size settings which are working for them and now when they upgrade suddenly performance is going to degrade a lot. This is going to be particularly painful because they can't change the cache size at runtime. Even if this value has a more intuitive meaning I don't think we're making anyone's lives that much better because it still doesn't have a very intuitive meaning and is just an unwieldy tool to use which is why it's going away."
