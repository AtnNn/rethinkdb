      "I think people complain about it by setting an appropriate cache size, running out of memory, then complaining to us that the OOM killer sniped their process.\r\n\r\nIf I were 100% confident that the new cache would be in next and working by the next release, I don't think this would be worth it, but we don't have the best track record with deadlines."
