      "I think we should fix this, even if this will go away all together a month later. We're not yet at a stage where we should worry about being backwards compatible with our own bugs.\r\n\r\nOn a different note, I spent the past week talking to a lot of users over the phone/Skype. When I asked them what they don't like about Rethink, #97 and #1375 came up in almost every conversation. Performance/scalability was a very distant (and much more vague) third complaint. So we should try really hard to get #97 and #1375 out the door ASAP.\r\n\r\n"
