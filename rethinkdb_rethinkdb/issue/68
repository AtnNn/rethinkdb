        "Currently our html files contain references to the old walkthrough images which don't actually exist on the server. There's no exposed links but this does lead to error messages if someone crawls the site. Generally I think it's poor form the have links to things that don't exists even if they're concealed.\n\nA much lesser issue is that we get the same thing robots.txt ... I actually don't even consider that to be a real issue.\n"
