        "Somehow related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3709\n\nTypically if I want to build a leaderboard, I'll run something like this:\n\n```\nr.table('users').orderBy({index: 'score'}).limit(10).changes()\n```\n\nAnd then try to maintain an array of the best users. \n\nThe changes I'll get will be like this:\n\n``` js\n{\n    new_val: {id: 14, score: 68},\n    old_val: {id: 23, score: 10} \n}\n```\n\nThe problem is that while I can remove the last element `{id: 23, score: 10}` from my array, I have no idea where I should insert the new document `{id:14, score: 68}` (without going through my array).\nIt would be nice to return the new/old position in `changes()` for ordered sequences. Augmenting the data like what ReQL does for `getNearest` seems like a good idea to me.\n"
