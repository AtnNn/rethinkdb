        "I realize we're too close to the release for this, but here's a thought I just had: what if in addition to letting people write `r.table('test').changes()` and click `run`, we had a button called `changes` and people could type `r.table('test')` and then either hit `run` or `changes` depending on whether or not they wanted live updates?\n\nIf we were really fancy we could even type-check the query and gray out the `changes` button if it isn't something you can call changes on.\n\nOnce we can call `changes` on more things, I think this would really drive home the idea that there are two primary modes of interaction: polling and getting live updates.\n\n@coffeemug, @mglukhovsky, @AtnNn, @deontologician, @danielmewes -- any thoughts?\n"
