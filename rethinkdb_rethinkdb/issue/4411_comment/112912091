      "Thanks for bringing the question up for discussion @danielcompton .\r\n\r\nI don't think we will remove protocol buffer definitions for generating protocol constants really soon.\r\nIn the longer run it should make sense for us to replace the proto file by for example a JSON file that contains all of the protocol constants though.\r\n\r\nI think we should not add the package at this point. While it might be cleaner, it will also affect a lot of third party driver developers who might then have to work around it or adapt their code."
