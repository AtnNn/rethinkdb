      "It would have to be a `datum_t` type to be storable in an array.  If we just prohibited serializing it anywhere except for the endpoint of a range, `between` would still work.  (Also, the notation was ambiguous because I was doing Ruby's thing where functions of no arguments lack parentheses, but I think `r.maxval` should be a function.  Then you could send functions to the shards that include `r.maxval()` in their code without the result of `r.maxval()` needing to be serializable.)"
