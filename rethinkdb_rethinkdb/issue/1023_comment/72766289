      "We could let them be serialized if we wanted to. JavaScript supports `Infinity`, Python supports `float('inf')`, and Ruby probably has a similar concept.\r\n\r\nI know `r.maxval` and `Infinity` aren't exactly the same thing, but that's one way the drivers could treat the serialized value that doesn't seem insane to me."
