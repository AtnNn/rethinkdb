      "@coffeemug -- `r.maxval` isn't just an infinitely large number, it's larger than everything else (including all strings and all pseudotypes).  I don't think there's a good equivalent of that in our client languages.\r\n\r\n@timmaxw -- I think we should implement it as a pseudotype internally just because it's easier (that's also how we do `r.literal`), but I still think we shouldn't send it to the user or write it to disk because that probably has the potential to be really really confusing."
