      "> Another option would be to introduce a new pseudo-type for `r.minval` and `r.maxval`.\r\n\r\nI'm down with this idea.  @mlucy, I don't think we can get away with not having them serializable *to the cluster*.  Not serializable *to the disk* is a different issue.  It would be ... difficult to forcibly prevent it from leaking to users, as I understand the driver end.  How do you propose doing it?\r\n\r\nI too had the \"well but +INF and -INF\" idea, but as @mlucy points out the fact that these terms have to have special casing with our other ordering constraints means they have a legitimate reason to exist."
