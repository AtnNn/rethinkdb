        "Hi guys,\n\nsince Version 2.1.0 and onwards I'm suffering from the `error: Found a secondary index from unsupported RethinkDB version 1.13.  You can migrate this secondary index using RethinkDB 2.0.` In 2.0.x everything was fine. I'm on Yosemite 10.10.5, installed RethinkDB via Homebrew. Here's what I'm getting:\n\n> Running rethinkdb 2.1.2 (CLANG 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.53))...\n> Running on Darwin 14.5.0 x86_64\n> Loading data from directory /Users/username/rethinkdb_data\n> Migrating cluster metadata\n> Version: rethinkdb 2.1.2 (CLANG 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.53))\n> error: Found a secondary index from unsupported RethinkDB version 1.13.  You can migrate this > secondary index using RethinkDB 2.0.\n> Trace/BPT trap: 5\n\nI'm more than happy to hand over the rethinkdb_data folder since it was dummy/test data anyway... Please let me know how I can assist. Love your work!\n\nCheers\nRalph\n"
