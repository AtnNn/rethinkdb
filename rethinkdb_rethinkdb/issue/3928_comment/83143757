      "I think a better interface for this might be to have a the ability to save queries to a favorites list, and then have a similar expanding panel for favorite queries that pops down like history. Maybe with a keyboard command for quickly loading a favorite by number (like Ctrl+1 to load the first favorite).\r\n\r\n This would be good for demos as well"
