        "It's common to want to rename attributes, but right now there is no sugar to do it. We can introduce a `rename` or `as` command to make things nicer:\n\n```\nr.expr({a: 1, b: 2}).rename({ foo: r.row('a'), bar: r.row('b')})\n```\n\nThis would be equivalent to:\n\n```\nobj.without('a', 'b').merge({ foo: obj('a'), bar: obj('b')})\n```\n\nLike in other ops, handling static value sugar and nested objects is an open question here.\n"
