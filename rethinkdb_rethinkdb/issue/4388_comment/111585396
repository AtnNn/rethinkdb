      "The testing aspect is a good point. I think we should pick whichever option is easier.\r\n\r\nIf they are similar in difficulty (which I now think they are), the command line option seems to be slightly more low level and able to recover in more cases, since it doesn't require even the table metadata to work. With the read option, we still rely on the server having knowledge of which tables exist. The command line option would work in cases where the metadata is corrupted or missing, or where we trigger some guarantee in some of the clustering or query code that makes the server terminate before the user can even issue the emergency read query.\r\n\r\nBecause of this I have a slight preference for the command line option, but not a strong one."
