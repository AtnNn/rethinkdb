      "I actually think the command line argument might be easier.\r\n\r\nWe just have to open the specified file with a serializer and cache, and spawn a parallel (or concurrent or whatever) traversal on it with a JSON writer as the callback.\r\n\r\nFor a special read mode I think we will have to create a completely new path through the query execution and routing code that does sharding differently, and accesses the server in some direct way, don't we?\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm under and/or over-estimating the complexity of these things though."
