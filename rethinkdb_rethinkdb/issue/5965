        "Hi RethinkDB Team, I've been using RethinkDB along with the Python driver for about a year now. I'm pretty good about always running with the latest release of both. (I follow both on VersionEye, so I get an email notification when there's a new release of either.) I noticed that you do releases for drivers (and therefore version drivers) independently of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/releases (see e.g. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rethinkdb), but the only release notes I've found are at https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/releases, so when there's a new driver release, I never know what's changed since the previous version.\r\n\r\nSince you release drivers independently of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/releases (with good reason), would you be open to maintaining independent release notes along with them? This could be as simple as maintaining a changelog file directly in the driver source, something like CHANGES.md in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/tree/next/drivers/python.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration and thanks for RethinkDB!"
