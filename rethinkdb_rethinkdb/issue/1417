        "Similar to #1379 when using `rethinkdb import`, I had some minor confusion when using `rethinkdb restore` that could have been avoided with improved error messages.\r\n\r\nThe specific error message that tripped me up was:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndr-manhattan:rethinkdb-dump michael$ rethinkdb restore\r\narchive to import not specified\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe workflow I followed was to:\r\n  - create a new directory\r\n  - run `rethinkdb dump` on one version of RethinkDB\r\n  - install the new version\r\n  - `cd` to that directory\r\n  - run `rethinkdb restore`\r\n  - read a confusing error message (I don't recall creating an archive!)\r\n  - realize that `rethinkdb dump` created an output file\r\n  - run `rethinkdb --help` to see how to specify an archive\r\n  - run `rethinkdb restore <archive>`\r\n\r\n...which of course makes sense in retrospect, but a clearer error message (\"Specify a RethinkDB archive (created by `rethinkdb dump`) with `rethinkdb restore <archive>`\" or something to that effect) would go a long ways to making this a lot clearer.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to sit down with @Tryneus to go over error messages for `restore` and `dump` to see if we can improve them for absolute clarity."
