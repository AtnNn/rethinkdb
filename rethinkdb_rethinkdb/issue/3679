        "`r.table('foo').reconfigure(shards=n, replicas=m)` will never fail due to insufficient data, but `r.table('foo').rebalance()`, which appears to perform a subset of `reconfigure`'s tasks, will error with:\n 'There isn't enough data in the table to create _n_ balanced shards.'\n\nI think this error would be better if replaced with a no-op.  It is just another error that users need to know about and handle, without much difference to the user.  \n"
