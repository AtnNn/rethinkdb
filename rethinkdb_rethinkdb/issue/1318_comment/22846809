      "I spent a little more time playing with my data, and there is a bug, but it's not about orderBy and desc.\r\n\r\nSome fields didn't get updated when I ran an update command on the table, and the fields were just missing. Ordering by descending order somehow showed these rows first and I naively thought that orderBy was plucking the results.\r\n\r\nClosing.\r\n\r\nI'll open another issue for update once I get a little more information."
