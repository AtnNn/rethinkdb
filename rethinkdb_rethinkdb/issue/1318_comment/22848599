      "I don't think so.\r\n\r\nI think what happened is (if someone could confirm, it would be great):\r\n\r\nI ran this query in the data explorer\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"test\").update({\r\n  value: r.js(\"Math.random\")\r\n}, {nonAtomic: true})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I just closed the tab (or left it open maybe), and the connection probably timed out after 5 min, which interrupted the query (that's the part I am not sure about). In the end only a part of my documents were updated, and ordering by id descending somehow just showed the one that were not updated.\r\n\r\nNote: I can ran a normal update with `update({test:\"test\"})`, the results will be the same (some documents will not be updated)"
