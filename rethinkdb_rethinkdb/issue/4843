        "As I was going through the list of tables on my local RethinkDB instance, I noticed that there's no way to currently tell how many tables I've selected as I scroll, nor anyway to take action on them without scrolling all the way up to the top. \n\nI think something that Google has done with Inbox or photos.google.com where there are fixed position action bars at the top once you've made selections might be effective to alleviating this problem. \n\nBefore selection:\n![screenshot 2015-09-15 18 36 44](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/863286/9894453/c8e91c84-5bd8-11e5-85c8-8cac17af9ab5.png)\n\nAfter selection:\n\n![screenshot 2015-09-15 18 32 34](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/863286/9894456/cb0b5342-5bd8-11e5-8e19-44e9456a7fa4.png)\n\nAnd note that the top bar is fixed to the top of the viewport and follows as I scroll up and down. I think this will make it easier to manage clusters with large amounts of tables and allow the UI to scale. \n"
