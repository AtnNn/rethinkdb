      "This is usually a timeout issue if you run this from the web UI.\r\n\r\nIf you run the same query from node or one of the other clients it should work (the web UI uses a short timeout for queries).\r\nIt's surprising that the indexed variant is this slow though. Did you run it multiple times? Maybe it's so slow because the index isn't in the cache at first and it has to load it from disk.\r\n\r\nWe might also have some serious inefficiency in how we do indexed `distinct`. Will need to investigate this.\r\n\r\n"
