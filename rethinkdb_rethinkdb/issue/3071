        "Config files used by the init script have different default than config files used by rethinkdb. The init script parses the config file and fills in the missing options with different default.\r\n\r\n* It confuses users when `rethinkdb --config /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d/foo.conf` uses very different defaults than `/etc/init.d/rethinkdb start`\r\n* The documentation is conflicting. The [startup guide](http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/cluster-on-startup/) conflicts with `rethinkdb --help`.\r\n* The config files are incompatible with other init systems (such as systemd, #2014). Currently, the [startup guide](http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/cluster-on-startup/) explains how to launch rethinkdb using both init.d and systemd using the same config file, which will not work."
