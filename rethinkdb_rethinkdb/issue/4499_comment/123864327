      "Thanks for the update @GordyD , and sorry for the delay.\r\nAt this point the only short-term option I see apart from upgrading memory is to reduce RethinkDB's cache size (unless it's already small). Are you currently setting the cache size manually or using the default? If you're using the default, could you check the RethinkDB server log for a message along the lines of \"Automatically using cache size of ...\" and let me know which size it's using?\r\n\r\nAnother relevant question is how big your data set approximately is. What is the on-disk size of the RethinkDB data folder?"
