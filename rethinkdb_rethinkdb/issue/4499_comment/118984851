      "Hi @GordyD , thank you for the issue report.\r\nYou might be able to avoid this issue by passing the `--clients 1` argument to `rethinkdb export` in order to limit the number of concurrent export clients. This might be enough to reduce the memory overhead during the export (though it's likely going to take a bit longer).\r\n\r\nHow large is your database?"
