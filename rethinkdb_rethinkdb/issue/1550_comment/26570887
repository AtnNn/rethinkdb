      "This appears to be a combination of a couple things.  First, it's expecting the IPs to be resolved in a certain order, which is silly.  Second, those are valid public IP addresses, which we shouldn't use because they can actually resolve to things.  With any luck, that's the extent of the issue.  I'll try to get ahold of an OSX machine tomorrow to check if that's all."
