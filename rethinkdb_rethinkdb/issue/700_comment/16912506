      "So, I think there is a slightly dumber solution we might want to try first. Just put a giant image of whether travis is passing or failing in next on the projector, along with the name of the person that did the first failing push. This way when something breaks we'll know to yell at someone right away, and we'll know who that someone is. I suspect that would fix 99% of our problems with *very* little work, and with no change whatsoever to people's workflow."
