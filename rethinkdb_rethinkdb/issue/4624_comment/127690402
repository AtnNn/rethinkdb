      "The reason for `{description: r.row(\"value1\") + \" \" + r.row(\"value2\")}` not working is that we cannot overload the `+` operator in JavaScript. Hence JavaScript simply converts the code into a string, because you're adding a string to it (this happens client-side).\r\nIn Python and Ruby we can overload `+`, which is why this code would have worked there.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we want the same term to appear multiple times in the list. I can see it being useful in this case. Have to think about it a bit.\r\n\r\nI'll open a new issue in the docs repo to add an example (or note) for the variadic `add` command."
