      "Oy, man. Alright, after digging into this further, the dataset that I provided above is not complete. The endpoint that I retrieved that dataset from was filtering out a bunch of data. It's *much* larger.\r\n\r\nHere is a *single* item: https://snipt.net/raw/60bf4c084bea329f19c2d636b561f455/\r\n\r\nThere are 413 of those items in that table.\r\n\r\nNow, I'd say this is certainly a case for restructuring this data and pulling out relative documents into their own tables, but MongoDB seems to be able to pull down this data in a fraction of the time. When I'm retrieving the data, I'm plucking with this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.pluck([\r\n  \"id\",\r\n  { \"defaultStyle\": { \"make\": \"name\" }},\r\n  { \"defaultStyle\": { \"make\": \"niceName\" }},\r\n  { \"defaultStyle\": { \"year\": \"year\" }},\r\n  \"features\",\r\n  \"name\",\r\n  \"niceName\",\r\n  \"msrp\",\r\n  \"cityMPG\",\r\n  \"highwayMPG\",\r\n  \"category\",\r\n  \"fullName\",\r\n  \"slug\",\r\n  \"defaultPhoto\"\r\n])\r\n```"
