      "> One possible lead is creating ~50 tables, deleting them, and then testing the performance. It's possible that there is residual memory left after table deletion that was slowing everything down. We'll try this internally and see if that causes any problems (though this hasn't been reported before).\r\n\r\nOn that note, I'm individually inserting *every single item*, which equates to about 50,000 inserts (this was a carryover from Mongo, where performance inserting thousands of items in one call was not great)."
