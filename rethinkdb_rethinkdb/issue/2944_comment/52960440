      "> I think it has somehow imported extra data from the Mongo collection that is not appearing when pulling the data out of RethinkDB.\r\n\r\nHmm, I don't see how that could possibly be the case.\r\n\r\nOne possible lead is creating ~50 tables, deleting them, and then testing the performance. It's possible that there is residual memory left after table deletion that was slowing everything down. We'll try this internally and see if that causes any problems (though this hasn't been reported before)."
