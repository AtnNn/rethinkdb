      "Woah, this is crazy. So I left out an important piece: I'm importing this data from MongoDB, and I *think* it has somehow imported extra data from the Mongo collection that is not appearing when pulling the data out of RethinkDB.\r\n\r\nI completely rebuilt the DB, and then manually imported the items from the URL I gave you - just raw JSON, and I'm getting normal execution times (few hundred ms)."
