      "A couple of questions:\r\n\r\n- Could you try creating a new/fresh instance of RethinkDB with just one table, inserting the data from scratch, and running the query again? Does that change the performance?\r\n- If you run the same query multiple times without restarting the server, does the performance change?\r\n- What happens if you connect to the server with a driver (like Python) instead of the data explorer and run the query? Does the performance change?"
