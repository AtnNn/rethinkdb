      "> What happens if you connect to the server with a driver (like Python) instead of the data explorer and run the query? Does the performance change?\r\n\r\nI'm using the JS driver in Node, and the performance doesn't change. That's how I initially became aware of the problem (my endpoint for retrieving items was taking that long).\r\n\r\n> If you run the same query multiple times without restarting the server, does the performance change?\r\n\r\nTry 1: `19.07s`\r\n\r\nAfter I ran the query once in the data explorer, it locks up the browser for the entirety of the query. After I ran the first query, the results appeared indicating the execution time of 19.07s, but the browser locked up and I could not re-run the query in the same page. I reloaded the data explorer in a new tab.\r\n\r\nTry 2: `14.02s`\r\n\r\n... reloaded data explorer in a new tab.\r\n\r\nTry 3: `13.94s`\r\n\r\n> Could you try creating a new/fresh instance of RethinkDB with just one table, inserting the data from scratch, and running the query again? Does that change the performance?\r\n\r\nI'll do that and report back."
