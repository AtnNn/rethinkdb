      "It looks like openssl.sh doesn't know how to cross-compile and the v8.sh doesn't know how to build on ARM correctly\r\n\r\n@kingkorf If you build or install ARM versions of v8 and/or libcurl separately, you might be able to get rethinkdb to build. Make sure the rethinkdb configure script shows `-lv8` and `-lcurl` instead of `external/v8` and `external/curl`. You may need to edit or remove the `configure.defaults` file.\r\n\r\nIf you get it to build, I would love to hear about it and get a patch of the changes you made. Cross-compiling from amd64 linux and building on raspberry pi used to work well, but it hasn't been maintained for the past few releases.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes @mglukhovsky How much effort should I put into the ARM build? I am inclined to move this issue to the backlog."
