      "@oliver006 Those instructions were written for RethinkDB 2.0, but RethinkDB has changed a lot since then.\r\n\r\nYour log seems to indicate that `build/external/v8_3.30.33.16/build/third_party/icu/configure` might be missing. Are you building from a fresh source tree? You could try doing `rm -rf external/v8*; make clean` then test if it builds with `make install-include-v8`.\r\n\r\nRelated to #5137"
