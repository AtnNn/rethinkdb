      "That's crazy if the Python driver discards responses instead of erroring.  It knows the server is sending back garbage!  Any driver with a synchronous API shouldn't be sending two queries without waiting for the first to respond, unless the first was a noreply query, or unless it was deliberately designed to do so (which is possible, but unlikely they'd mistakenly rely on message ordering if that was so)."
