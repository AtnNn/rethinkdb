      "If I open a feed, and send a `CONTINUE` query, I won't get any response until the server sees a change with (`v0_4`).\r\nSo if no change happens and if I want to close the feed, I have to send the `STOP` query.\r\n\r\nMy question is:\r\n- What happens in this case? I seem to be stuck (no response is returned) for the `CONTINUE` or `STOP` query.\r\n- Is the `CONTINUE` query supposed to return nothing? An error?"
