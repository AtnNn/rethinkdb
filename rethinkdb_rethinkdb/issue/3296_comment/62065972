      "The reason we've hesitated to do this is that in asynchronous languages like JS people sometimes write things like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntable.insert(...).run(conn, callback)\r\ntable.filter(...).run(conn, callback)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand expect the `filter` to see the write performed by the `insert`.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth just putting up with that problem, though.  Tagging this as `RQL_proposal`, we should talk about it during the next discussion period."
