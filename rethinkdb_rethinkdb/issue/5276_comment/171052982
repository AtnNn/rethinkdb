      "Hmmm... It seems I don't have a file like ``build/external/v8_*_install.log``. I ran ``find <build_dir> -name \\*.log\\*`` and nothing matched your description. Is it created by default or do I have to set a flag?\r\n\r\nThe ICU build detects ``/usr/bin/c++`` correctly, that's true. I got it wrong on first sight, sorry. It's about the detected C compiler, not C++:\r\nICU's build script claims ``CC='clang'`` and uses it to compile the test program in the step ``checking whether the C compiler works`` in line 81 of ``icu-config.log``. This fails immediately, because Clang does not recognize some of the flags, which are meant for GCC.\r\nDoes this description make more sense?\r\n\r\nI'd expect the test program to be compile with ``/usr/bin/cc``, which runs GCC on my system.\r\n\r\nThanks for investigating!"
