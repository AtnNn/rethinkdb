      "I prepended the correct ``CC`` variable to the build command and it runs smoothly as always. This change will go into a RethinkDB package for Gentoo linux :)\r\nFrom my point of view, this issue can be closed. Thanks for your help!\r\n\r\nHowever, I still consider setting ``CC`` a workaround for a bug in the build system of V8 or ICU."
