      "@neumino -- it looks to me like the data explorer is mis-reporting the size of the query to the server.  That Unicode character takes three bytes to represent, and the query that the server sees seems to be missing two bytes on the end of it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2014-06-03T14:50:22.934079606 Thread 0: HTTP: [1,\"?\",{\"profile\":false\r\n2014-06-03T14:50:22.934143028 Thread 0: HTTP: 5b 31 2c 22 e2 8d 85 22 2c 7b 22 70 72 6f 66 69 6c 65 22 3a 66 61 6c 73 65 \r\n```\r\n\r\nAre you sure you're sending the number of bytes in the string rather than the \"length\" of the string (which presumably counts the Unicode as one character rather than 3 bytes)?"
