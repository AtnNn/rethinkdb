      "I believe part 1 of your proposal (have `orderBy` take a function) is already working:\r\n```\r\nr.expr([1, 2, 3]).orderBy(function(x) { return x; })\r\n-> [1, 2, 3]\r\n\r\nr.expr([1, 2, 3]).orderBy(function(x) { return r.expr(0).sub(x); })\r\n-> [3, 2, 1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course that doesn't generally solve your initial use case, so something like `sort` would be useful. Alternatively we could overload `orderBy` for a two-argument function and interpret that as the `<` operator, but that might be a bit too implicit.\r\n\r\n@mlucy Did you mean 2.0 or 2.1? I think it's worth doing for 2.1, but wouldn't put it into 2.0."
