      "The problem I have with the second option is that it\r\n\r\na) Is more work to design and implement, so it would probably delay the 2.3 release.\r\n\r\nb) That it comes with the annoyance of adding extra steps to bootstrapping and extending a cluster.\r\nIn option 1, all you need to do is add the `--initial-pw auto` argument to any servers that you add to your cluster after the initial ones. In option 2, you need to first download a script to generate the ID+password file, then start up the cluster servers and copy the generated file onto them. While the second step isn't fundamentally different from having to provide the correct `--join` parameters which is necessary in either case, I think it does make a difference in people's perception. Copying a file is an additional step, and one that involves the use of an additional tool (like scp or similar). It also slightly complicates automating cluster setup and scaling. It doesn't make it substantially more difficult, but it does add an extra thing that needs to be taken care of.\r\n\r\nI further think that the first approach does not interfere with cluster IDs if we want to add them later. I said in the writeup above that the admin password couldn't be changed in proposal 2 except by swapping out the file, but that is not an integral part of a cluster-ID-based approach. Instead we can base a cluster-ID based design on proposal 1, and simply have the ID file replace the initial password if one is provided."
