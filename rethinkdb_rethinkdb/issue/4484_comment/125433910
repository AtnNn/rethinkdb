      "It turns out several of these were actually caused by us handling `datum_exc_t`s incorrectly in `query_cache.cc` (we were just overwriting the error type with an internal error).  I have a fix for that, but I'm waiting on #4590 since a lot of the error type tests are failing in `next` anyway."
