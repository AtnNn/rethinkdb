      "To be clear, what Michel means is that any callback's passed to the driver should be checked to ensure that they are callable at the entry point into the driver code. This is important because, as an asynchronous callback, the error thrown when we try to call some other object type will occur somewhere else in the code making it really hard to debug the source of the problem."
