      "The string type would probably continue to be UTF-8 only, because we support string operations that need to know an encoding (like `.match`).  Binary is just dumb data storage with no encoding; not many terms can be called on it, and it's serialized specially to the clients since a lot of JSON libraries can't handle binary data in strings."
