      "FWIW: http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/character_encoding indicates that Shift JIS represents about 1.3% of the web as of today.  GB2312 and GBK are both Chinese, Windows-1251 is commonly used for Cyrillic character sets, and Windows-1252 is a superset of ISO 8859-1 that is important for legacy stupid reasons.  I bring this up because it means that any effort to \"do the right thing\" with non-UTF-8 strings will have to deal with Shift JIS, which is one of the least sane character codings ever devised."
