      "As discussed with @danielmewes offline, we're going to allow indexing strings containing null bytes for new secondary indexes only (disallowed in primary indexes.) Datums in general will be unrestricted wrt strings containing null bytes.\r\n\r\n_Reasoning: Adding support for null bytes in primary keys would require adding versioning support to the primary index, which gets to be a nasty change for many reasons. We can do that later if need be._"
