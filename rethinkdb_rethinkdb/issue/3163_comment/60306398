      "Strings currently have an implicit encoding of UTF-8.  This is not enforced by anything and in fact we violate it in several places; not all byte strings represent valid Unicode code points.  In particular the high bit of the first byte cannot be set (it indicates a multibyte code point).  All bits 0 is a valid UTF-8 byte (if the previous byte does not indicate a multibyte code point) encoding U+0000; in particular it is a control character, and possesses the (deprecated) Unicode 1.0 character name NULL.  This obviously causes problems.  In so-called [\"Modified UTF-8\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Modified_UTF-8) U+0000 is encoded as the byte sequence `0xC0`, `0x80`; in Modified UTF-8, all bits 0 can continue to be used as a string terminator."
