      "Hmm in a quick test of running\r\n`r.js(\"while (true) {}\", {timeout: 60})`\r\nand then killing the client (not HTTP, a normal plain TCP client) the query appeared to be interrupted fine on OS X.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we have some other mechanism in place on OS X to detect closed connections, or if it only works in this case because we're also reading from the client connection and the read then throws the exception once the connection is lost.\r\nI guess in the HTTP case we're no longer reading from the connection once we've got all the headers are we?"
