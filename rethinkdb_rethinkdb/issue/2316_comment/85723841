      "@danielmewes, now that we have the `jobs` table, this is more viable.  Before, if you had a runaway query run from the data explorer, the only way to cancel it was to abort it in the data explorer (which closes the HTTP ReQL connection, I believe), or, if you had already closed the data explorer, you had to wait for it to timeout.\r\n\r\nWe could remove the timeout, but it would mean that a user with a runaway query would need to kill it through the jobs table if they no longer have their data explorer open."
