      "@milesdeem Can you send me an email (bill@rethinkdb.com) to which I can rely with an updated python package? You can then install the package by running `sudo pip install --upgrade <downloaded .tar.gz package>`\r\n\r\nI added some print statements that will print both the query protobuf and the response protobuf. If you could then post this output here we'll be able to resolve some important open questions as to the source of this problem."
