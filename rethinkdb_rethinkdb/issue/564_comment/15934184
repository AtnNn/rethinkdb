      "@milesdeem This is fixed and published to pip. @milesdeem Can you confirm the fix by upgrading to the latest package on pip and try running your test again? Thanks for your help. This turned out to be a lot more subtle than we originally thought and we couldn't have done it without you.\r\n\r\nAnd because we're still curious, are you running some other Python implementation than CPython? We're still puzzled as to why this was an issue for you and not for us."
