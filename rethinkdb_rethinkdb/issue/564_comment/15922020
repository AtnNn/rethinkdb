      "@milesdeem could you please let us know:\r\n\r\n1. what version of `protobuf` you have installed? ( `pip freeze | grep proto`)\r\n\r\n2. what version of Python? (i.e. `python --version`)\r\n\r\n3. do you have RethinkDB installed on Mint too? Could you try to connect to that instead of the remote server? (trying to figure out if the port forwarding could be the issue) How do you set up port forwarding?\r\n\r\nThis would help us get an environment as close to yours in order to hopefully reproduce the issue. Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\n"
