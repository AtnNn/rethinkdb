      "Thanks @milesdeem that output was *really* helpful. We think we've identified the source of the bug but still don't understand why it's showing up on your configuration and not ours. The problem seems to relate to the distinction between `==` and `is` in Python. For integer values the distinction shouldn't matter and on our system it doesn't. But when we changed a few `is`'s to `==` it appears to fix your problem.\r\n\r\nCould you just do one more thing for us and run the `r.db_list()` query again? This should work with the latest debugging driver we sent you. The error you're seeing with the other query is actually related (a different place where we're using `is`) and actually serves to further confirm this hypothesis."
