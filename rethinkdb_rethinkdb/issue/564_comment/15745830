      "`run` should return `None` only when your query returns the RQL NULL value. Really this means that None is returned every time the returned type is SUCCESS_ATOM and the `datum.type` field in the returned protobuf equals `Datum.R_NULL` (which is 1). Other than that there is no obvious way that `None` might be returned. If the protobuf were corrupted or the datum type were unknown you would get an error.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that if the driver and server were working off different versions of the protobuf the empty list value or and / or the number 0 could be interpreted as R_NULL but I can't know unless I can see the two different versions.\r\n\r\nHas anyone been able to replicate this?"
