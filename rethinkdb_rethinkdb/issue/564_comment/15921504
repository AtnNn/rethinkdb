      "The problem occurs straight out of the box, with the lightest load possible. I also tried uninstalling everything and doing a fresh install to see if it did any magic, but the same problem still occurs.\r\n\r\nTesting with only 1 database and 1-3 tables, all of which are either empty or contain just a few entries for testing purposes.\r\n\r\nI am able to successfully create databases, tables, documents in the tables, and am able to modify/delete all of the above. It appears that all functionality is in tact for sending commands to rethinkdb, whereas all attempts to retrieve anything from the database(s) return \"None\". \r\n\r\nI am unable to list databases, list tables, list documents, or perform any of the functionality to retrieve any form of data from the DB. The response is always \"None\" - but I am able to watch all the dbs/tables/documents being created successfully via the admin console. \r\n\r\nMy local box is running Mint 13 and I have a virtual server running Ubuntu, which I also installed RethinkDB on. I setup port forwarding from my local box to the server and again was able to successfully send commands to its DB to create entries, but again receive the response of \"None\" any time I try to retrieve data. When I use the python drivers locally on the Ubuntu server, it all works just fine. So it appears the problem lays somewhere within using the python drivers on my Mint 13 installation."
