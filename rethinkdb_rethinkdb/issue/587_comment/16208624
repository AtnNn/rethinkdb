      "@al3xandru I agree that wrapping the examples in parens is ridiculous. The real solution is to write the docs using a line breaking algorithm that doesn't create syntax errors, even if it's not as nice looking as some other algorithm.\r\n\r\nDoing a bit a \"cleanup\" before validating the code snippets completely misses the point of the validation process. We want to make sure that the snippets as presented on the API page will not break when copied and pasted as is into a repl. While I prefer beginning the line with a dot too, if the interpreter doesn't accept it like that we don't really have a choice."
