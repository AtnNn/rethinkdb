      "We have three basic queries, START, CONTINUE, and STOP.  You can send a STOP query and it should theoretically pulse the interruptor and remove the corresponding token from the stream cache.  Now that I'm writing this, I don't remember implementing that logic, so I should probably do that.\r\n\r\nBy \"write placement\" I meant testing to make sure that you get back an error if you do a write in e.g. a map."
