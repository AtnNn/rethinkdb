      "I think `generated_keys` wouldn't really fit into `replace`, because `replace` never \"generates\" a key. The keys must be given beforehand.\r\nIt seems like \"inserted keys\" would be the right thing here?\r\n\r\nWe have been planning to deprecate `generated_keys` completely in favor of adding a new `return_keys` option instead, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3074#issuecomment-73000449 . The `return_keys` option would make a `keys` value appear in the write result, which would look similar to `generated_keys`, but would include the primary keys of *all* inserted documents.\r\nI think that might handle your use case."
