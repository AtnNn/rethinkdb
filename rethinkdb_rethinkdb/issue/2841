        "Problem: In a three machine cluster we encountered a situation where two of the machines showed all tables as being available. However, we noticed that client connecting to the third machine were still getting errors when trying to access some tables. On this machine's dashboard about 1/3 tables was marked as unavailable even though the master responsible for those tables was up and the machine was connected. This unavailable state persisted for several minutes without any forward progress so...\r\n\r\nWorkaround: I restarted the \"unavailable\" machine and after a minute or so all tables reported as available."
