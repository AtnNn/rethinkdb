        "I recently ran into a problem building rethinkdb 1.11.0 because rather than using the version of python I have specified in my environment it was using the shebang's #!/usr/bin/python\n\nThis is probably not a problem for 90% of the people who have the same versions everywhere, but that's not the case for me where I work... \n\nI saw some scripts use #!/usr/bin/env python and some use #!/usr/bin/python, would be nice to standardize to #!/usr/bin/env python\n\nAlso, updating the copyrights in the script to extend to 2014 may be a good idea.\n"
