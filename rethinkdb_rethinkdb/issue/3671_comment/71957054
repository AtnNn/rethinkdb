      "I've added a release highlights and compatibility section to the release notes.\r\nAlso:\r\n* changed the wording for the debug tables\r\n* changed `identifier_format` to include databases\r\n* added removal of `rethinkdb admin`\r\n\r\nThe system tables already seem to be in the right order. Was there more bullet point reordering to do?\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky or @chipotle can you please make a pass over the highlights and compatibility sections?"
