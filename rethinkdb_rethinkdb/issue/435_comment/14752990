      "I'm running gentoo. Yes, I had 3.2 set as my default.\r\n\r\nI just switched to use 2.7 as default (`eselect set python2.7`) and it now compiles! Yay!\r\n\r\nMaybe add a check in ./configure so others don't run into this?\r\n\r\nI have a couple other build issues that ./configure did not detect pre-make. Should I make tickets for those \"bugs\"?"
