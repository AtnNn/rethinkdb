      "I don't see how the semantics are inconsistent.  They may be (and in fact probably are) sub-optimal, but they aren't inconsistent: `r.f(r.now, r.now) <=> x = Time.now; r.f(x, x)`.  `UUID`s are different because you get a different UUID every time you call it.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, maybe part of the problem is that `r.now()` is presented as a function in Python and JS?  In Ruby I right `r.now` with no parens and it makes it more obvious that it's a global value rather than a function that gets the current time."
