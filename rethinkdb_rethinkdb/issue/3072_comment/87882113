      "The issue is not with HFS+, everything we run on has to conform to POSIX (more or less), and that is what defines the behavior on open files. This was a technical issue when the web interface used a lot of external files, since those could then get out-of-sync with the web ui. Now that those are embedded in the binary there is no real technical issue.\r\n\r\nThere is still an expectation issue, in that someone who is installing an upgrade might expect that we would relaunch the server. But I am ok with no trying to go down that road.\r\n\r\nping @danielmewes "
