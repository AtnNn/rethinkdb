      "That's the idea. We'd hook this into the general `rethinkdb` command, so it shows up when you say `rethinkdb help`, and you can run it via `rethinkdb setup` or something of the sort (I don't actually think `setup` is a good name necessarily, but I can't think of anything better). It would then take the user through interactive steps to get this going.\r\n\r\nOn a different note, could you remind me what was the issue with daemonizing rethink? I had a number of people complain that if the pid file already exists, the init.d script exits with no indication of an error and is pretty hard to debug. Would daemonization help here? Can we improve the error msg in the script? (the reason I'm asking here of all places, is that this pid error was an inspiration for this issue)."
