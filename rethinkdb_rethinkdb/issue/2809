        "When `./test-runnner` is run with multiple versions of Ruby the `truncation.rb` test is failing on every-other interpreter. This is because unless a test reports and error the same server instance is used for the next test. And this test assumes that there is no `sindex_truncation` table at the start of execution.\n\nMy plan to fix this is to have the table name append the interpreter name (change to `./test-runner` to do this).\n"
