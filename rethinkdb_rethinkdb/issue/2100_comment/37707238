      "To reproduce the assertion failure, all I had to do was start a debug mode server, shut it down, then start it up again.  Looks like it's a problem with alt cache construction (happening in the persistent file construction).  I also observed a failing assert thread in a similar location, but that wasn't on `next`, so waiting for this to be fixed to see if I can reproduce that."
