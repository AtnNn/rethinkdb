      "For the first issue (getting one element back), I wouldn't call it desired behavior, but it's a consequence of how the API is implemented. If you pass a callback to `run` that returns true, it will get called for every row, and the final `collect` will return nothing at all. Currently, the callback to `run` gets first \"dibs\" on the data, and when it doesn't return true, remaining data is left in the cursor, and in this case is passed down to `collect`. We could change the API to allow access via run callback or cursor, but not both, or we could leave it as is. @pixelspark -- what do you think is better behavior from the user's point of view?\r\n\r\nThe second issue seems like a bug to me. Assigning @wmrowan."
