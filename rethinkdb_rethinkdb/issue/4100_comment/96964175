      "I don't know if we can easily update to the new version of cubism -- I hacked it to display line graphs and added support for multiple lines. We'd have to port this code to the new version, which is a pain.\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose two alternative solutions:\r\n\r\n- every five minutes, destroy the cubism canvas and start from scratch\r\n- use the same library we use on rethinkdb.com. Using d3 directly was a massive pain (which is why we used cubism), but graphing libraries have gotten much better since then. It would probably be very easy to replace cubism with the same library we use on the landing page."
