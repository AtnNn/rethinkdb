      "Testing this in chrome 44 dev, the problem disappears. It's still high memory consumption (230M or so), and it seems we're doing a lot of inefficient things with listeners (creating and destroying a lot of listeners and dom nodes that need to be garbage collected), but it seems the memory usage is stable in a newer Chrome. I'd like to try it out on OS X etc to verify, but this looks like it may have been a chrome memory leak triggered by the way we render the graph."
