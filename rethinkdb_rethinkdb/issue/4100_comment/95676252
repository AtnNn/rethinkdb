      "Hi, first, thanks for all the great work on RethinkDB.\r\nI can confirm this issue. If you open Task Manager in Chrome (Shift + Esc on Linux) and look at RethinkDB Administration Console tab memory usage, you'll see that number is constantly growing. It seems that if tab is out of focus, memory usage climbs faster by almost 1MB/s.\r\nAfter certain amount of time, tab stops responding and Chrome kills it.\r\n\r\nBrowser: Google Chrome\r\nOS: Debian Testing\r\nRethinkDB: 2.0.0"
