      "This issue seems to be completely absent on OS X Yosemite with Chrome 41, 42 and Chrome Canary (currently 44).\r\n\r\nSo far I've only been able to replicate it on Chrome 42 on linux (I used arch linux, so it's unlikely to be a Ubuntu bug).\r\n\r\nI think all signs point to Chrome 42 here. @djelic @ipastushenko could you guys post which version of Chrome/Chromium you're using? Also, are either of you running linux in a VM?"
