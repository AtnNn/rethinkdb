      "OK, I was able to conclusively replicate it in Chromium 42.0.2311.90 on Linux, and it is definitely gone in the most recent update Chromium 42.0.2311.135\r\n\r\nI think it's safe to say this was a leak in chrome and they've put out an update fixing the problem. @ipastushenko Ubuntu has the new version now, so you should be able to update and it should resolve the problem. @djelic you should probably be able to update as well, though I'm not familiar with the Debian release cycle.\r\n\r\nClosing as outdated"
