        "I'm testing rethinkdb now.\r\n\r\nMy configuration is: 3 nodes with rethinkdb 1.12.4, one db and one table (18M documents, 32 shard, 2 replicas, 1 ack). \r\n\r\nI'm experiencing very high memory usage on those 3 nodes. Seems, all of disk data was read by rethinkdb process (~49 GB at disk, ~48-50GB at rethinkdb process on all of the nodes). It's odd, because I have set cache-size=4096 at config file.\r\n\r\nAfter realizing that, I tried to restart one of the nodes. \r\nRestart takes about 15 seconds. \r\nAfter that, my table is in \"down\" state,  25/32 shards available,  33/64 replicas up to date.\r\nAfter an half an our, those restarted node still reading disk (99% io load) and table stats are the same.\r\n\r\nIs this correct behavior? 15 seconds node outage can't cause several hours table outage... \r\n"
