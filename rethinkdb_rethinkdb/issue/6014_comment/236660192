      "@bchavez I'm now tending towards ignoring the `STOP` result. It becomes rather complicated whenever there are concurrent outstanding requests on the cursor.\r\n\r\nIn some simpler drivers (like the PHP driver), handling the `STOP` response is easy. That's just because it doesn't allow multi-threaded access and doesn't perform any pre-fetching of cursor results though."
