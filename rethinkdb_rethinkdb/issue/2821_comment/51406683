      "> To be really sure that we're testing the right thing, I'm going to need the executables to be compiled with CPU_SHARDING_FACTOR set to 1.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, in the long run we'll want CPU_SHARDING_FACTOR to be a run-time option, to make our lives easier.  If it's per-machine, then machines with this set to a different value cannot be permitted to connect to one another.  That would be fine.  If it's per-table (which might be harder or easier than per-process, I don't know), it would ideally be a secret option upon table creation.\r\n\r\nThis will become a separate issue at some point."
