      "@coffeemug while that's definitely true it does reorder my hypotheses a little bit. Basically what's happening here is that in some code path perfmons with conflicting names are created. This has to be a somewhat esoteric code path because we don't always get these. From my knowledge of the sindex code I can't off the top of my head think of a reason that it would create new perfmons unless it had created some sindexes. Of course that's not a fact just my memory of the situation.\r\n\r\nIf this issue is reproducible I'd just put a `debugf` at the assert site and print out the conflicting name I bet that will get use a good direction on this bug. Actually why on earth haven't we changed this assertion to include this information?\r\n\r\nAlso I just noticed I'm assigned to this issue so maybe I'm making suggestions to myself here."
