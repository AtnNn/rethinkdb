      "Thanks for that clarification, @coffeemug. \r\nSo if, for example, I want to order by a field from the RHS, after a join with more documents than the array size limit, I need to pump the result into a new table, build an index on the field and then sort by that.\r\nI think there might be a documentation issue regarding this limitation and the recommended work-round and its performance. Perhaps in a [limits](https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/9) page. Or perhaps more prominently, e.g. under the join commands because this limitation likely affects my decision to adopt RethinkDB, and I'd like know about it before investing too much time trying it out.  @mglukhovsky?"
