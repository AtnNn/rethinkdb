      "Excellent, thanks. @neumino, @coffeemug  I suspected there was a way to do it; I'm happy to build an index for this purpose. \r\n\r\nI'm also getting some _RqlRuntimeError: Query interrupted.  Did you shut down the server?_ errors doing `...table(\"BigLottery\").forEach(function (bl) { return r.table('other').insert({ ... bl(...)... }); })` queries over the same data set.  I suspect these are to do with configuration; the error message is a bit unhelpful. I'm thinking about another question which I might ask on the google gorup, but if you happen to have a pointer to some relevant docs you could link here that'd be great."
