      "I think that in the current implementation joins preserve order, but there is no such guarantee in the language for performance reasons, so this behavior might change in the future. Unfortunately to get this done you might have to create a temp table.\r\n\r\nI opened another issue to allow for a configurable array size limit -- #2318. This should make things much easier for cases where you have small amounts of data that's greater than 100k docs."
