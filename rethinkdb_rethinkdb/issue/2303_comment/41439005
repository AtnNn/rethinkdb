      "Hello @bitterjug,\r\n\r\n\r\nYou need to create an index if you want to sort a lot of data.\r\n```\r\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"BigLottery\").indexCreate(\"amount\").run(conn, callback);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure the index was created\r\n```\r\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"BigLottery\").indexWait(\"amount\").run(conn, callback);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can run\r\n```\r\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"BigLottery\").orderBy({index: \"amount\"}).run(conn, callback)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason why you need an index is because RethinkDB doesn't come with an optimizer, and if you don't explicitly tell it to use one, it will not.\r\n\r\nBut it's a doc issue, and I just forgot to do it -- https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/159\r\nI'll fix that as soon as possible."
