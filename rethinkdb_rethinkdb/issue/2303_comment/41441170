      "To clarify, the reason you need an index is because RethinkDB is a real-time system and is intended to return results quickly enough to be usable for real-time applications. Sorting large numbers of elements gets slow in traditional databases, so Rethink will sort ad-hoc up to an array limit (100k elements), but requires an index for datasets larger than that."
