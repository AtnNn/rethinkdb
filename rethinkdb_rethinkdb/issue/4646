        "As exemplified in the `polyglot/arity` test the JavaScript driver is reporting a number of errors as `RqlDriverError`s when the other drivers report them as `RqlCompileError`s. The reasons for the current state are internal to how the drivers work, and so not ones that would matter for customers. I would rather we have consistency on this.\n\nProbably every `RqlDriverError` line in `polyglot/arity` should change after this.\n"
