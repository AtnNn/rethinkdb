      "As far as I can tell multi-document compression is a lot more difficult to implement in our codebase (though it would also be significantly more effective).\r\n\r\nA static dictionary that can be specified at table creation but can't be changed afterwards should also be fairly easy to do, and can help to reduce the overhead of repeating field names in each document if those names are known beforehand."
