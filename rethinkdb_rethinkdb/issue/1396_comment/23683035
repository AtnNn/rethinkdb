      "> Before that we should add variable length encoding for string lengths and find some way to avoid writing keys in all the places.\r\n\r\nThe string length thing would be good.  What do you mean by \"avoid writing keys in all the places\"?\r\n\r\n> We don't use protocol buffers to serialize datum_t objects.\r\n\r\nWe may want to consider offering gzip compression to/from the clients, too.  (Also, our own serialization function isn't that much better; we still serialize a whole double for every number, for example.)\r\n\r\n> Gzipping datum_t's and other forms of wanton compression could also expose some systems to BREACH-style attacks.\r\n\r\nDuly noted; we should document that we do this.  (This isn't as high on my list of concerns as our performance problems.)"
