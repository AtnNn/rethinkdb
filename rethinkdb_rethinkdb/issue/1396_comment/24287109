      "I think we should just use snappy for now.  Our original test data for benchmark X was highly redundant because it wasn't written expecting to be compressed; we'll have to revise it with a target snappy compression ration of about .5 (GitHub seems like as good a standard as anything for how well JSON documents will compress)."
