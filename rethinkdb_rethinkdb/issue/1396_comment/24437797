      "I did some preliminary testing on Benchmark X in JD's `snappy` branch with highly compressable data, and the write throughput was 8-10k, same as before.  This suggests that something else is the bottleneck (`perf top` didn't produce any obvious suspects).  I'll do some more tests on Monday."
