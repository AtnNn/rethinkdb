      "Most mature DB products I know implement compression, but make it optional (there are many obvious reasons why we can't make compression a requirement). I think we should do that -- make it an option on a table creation, and document the implications of the choice really well. This would let users decide whether space issues are more important to them than vulnerability risk (many people want to use Rethink as an analytics/reporting type system without outside access; storage space is much more important there than possible vulnerabilities).\r\n\r\nI don't know if compression should be on by default, but my intuition says it should be off."
