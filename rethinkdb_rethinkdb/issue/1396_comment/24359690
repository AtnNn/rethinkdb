      "A BREACH style attack is what you get when you compress secret data together with attacker-supplied data.  The attacker can then figure out the contents of the secret data by measuring how well his data compresses together with the secret data.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose a dating website stores users' information in the following format `{ username: ..., email_address: ..., inbox: [...]}`.  A stalker could then figure out a user's email address by sending/deleting messages to the user and measuring how long it takes the server to respond to requests involving the user.  You can do this with relatively low timing resolution if you first figure out how much padding the message needs to be to make the document size reach the threshold of a block boundary."
