      "compression is an implementation detail to me and if you ship the libs with the product i don't care what you use.\r\n\r\nas for BREACH ... how is using compression in your data storage back end doesn't make a web service less secure? wouldn't a hacker need physical access to the compressed bytes on the disk of someone's rethinkdb server for this to matter? \r\n\r\nmy 2 cents says compression as a performance and storage optimization should default to on. if you were sacrificing performance for space (like gzip) it should default off. but working with big data has taught me that the value of compression is really increasing bandwidth (over the wire and on and off the disk) rather than space."
