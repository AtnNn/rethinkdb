      "I'd like to do this sooner rather than later, because I think it will help with Benchmark X (both speed and actually fitting the goddamn thing on disk).\r\n\r\n@jdoliner also recommended snappy, so I'm going to look into that.\r\n\r\n@atnnn -- snappy doesn't seem to have pre-precise packages, so we'd probably have to include it like with re2.  Would that be plausible?"
