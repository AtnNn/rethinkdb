      "please don't use gz as it is a CPU drain and slow (relatively speaking).\r\n\r\ncompression can gain you both space and speed performance if you choose an algorithm that has a higher bandwidth than the device from/to which you are reading/writing (either network or storage), and luckily these algorithms are typically very easy on the CPU as well.\r\n\r\nlook at lzo if you want something commonly available and well suited to high speed / low cpu. maybe take a peak at google's snappy as well."
