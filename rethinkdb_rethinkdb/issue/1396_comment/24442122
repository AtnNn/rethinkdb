      "So, I did some more tests, and they're very strange.  On a 1-node cluster with no secondary indexes or extra write acks or anything, the following workloads:\r\n* 1 shard, no compression\r\n* 1 shard, 2x compression\r\n* 4 shards, no compression\r\n* 4 shards, 2x compression\r\n\r\nall have the exact same behavior: 3-4k writes per second, single-digit CPU utilization by all threads except for 4, and those 4 have 40-80% CPU utilization."
