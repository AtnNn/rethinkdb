      "Once you guys get back to this issue, please consider the LZ4 algorithm (https://code.google.com/p/lz4/ ) as it is faster than Snappy at compression and decompression. Or maybe LZ4 HC for data that is rarely written.\r\n\r\nAlso worth taking a look is https://github.com/carlomedas/4mc (a compression lib for Hadoop)\r\n"
