      "Thanks for sharing @polidore .\r\n\r\nThe `datum_t` compression proposed here might end up being a bit less effective compared to the block compression of WiredTiger when it comes to small documents. For large documents it might work better. This depends a bit on how large the \"blocks\" are that WiredTiger uses, which I'm not sure about.\r\n\r\nGood data point in favor of snappy though in either case."
