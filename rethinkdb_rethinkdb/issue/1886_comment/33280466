      "I managed to get a better profile in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThe big picture is basically this:\r\n   Less than 15% of the CPU time is spend in the `store_t::protocol_read()` function, which actually fetches the data from the btree. The remaining time is spend on things such as deserializing and serializing cluster messages, distributing reads to shards, parsing the query, constructing and destructing temporary data structures etc.\r\n\r\nClose to 3.5% is spent in the counted_t destructor alone (66% of the 3.5% in the datum_t destructor)."
