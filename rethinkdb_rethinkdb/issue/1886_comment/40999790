      "A 20% improvement can be obtained by saving the serialization and deserialization between a broadcaster_t and a listener_t.\r\n\r\nSimilar improvements are probably possible if we also avoid serializing the queries and responses when using a master_t and/or direct_reader_t if they are on the local machine. Though that will only help on single nodes and in very small clusters."
