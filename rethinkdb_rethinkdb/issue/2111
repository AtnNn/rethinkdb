        "Qutoes comments by coffeemug from issue #2098:\n\n  I noticed from #2097 that some user errors are printed as Python\n  exceptions (with Traceback and everything). They shouldn't be -- we\n  should just print proper error messages and return user values. Printing\n  Python exceptions and tracebacks is really unfriendly in those cases.\n\nLink: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2098\n\nSigned-off-by: Liu Aleaxander Aleaxander@gmail.com\n"
