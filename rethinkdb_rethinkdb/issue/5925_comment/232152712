      "RethinkDB indeed relies on the underlying storage system (hard drives and/or file system) to ensure the integrity of the blocks on disk. There currently is no setting to enable additional checksums.\r\n\r\nI think we'll add something like block-level checksums to RethinkDB's storage engine in the future. Unfortunately it's a non-trivial undertaking primarily for reasons of having to ensure backwards-compatibility, but I think we'll get to it eventually.\r\n\r\nTo answer your other questions:\r\n\"majority\" reads only obtain the data from one server. The option ensures that the data that has been read has been written to a majority of replicas to avoid uncommitted reads, but does not protect against disk corruption."
