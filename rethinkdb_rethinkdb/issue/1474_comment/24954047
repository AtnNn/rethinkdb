      "I didn't think this through properly. @jdoliner noted that perfmons are currently aggregated over the whole cluster. Enabling them on a per-node basis therefore has limited usefulness.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, we should probably add a way to enable individual perfmons on the cluster level.\r\nFor now we can work around this by enabling perfmons at compile time when needed."
