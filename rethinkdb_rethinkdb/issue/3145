        "I looked through the open issues and I couldn't see anything around adding SSL at both the driver layer and the intracluster communication. I know SSL is a pain in the butt to work with but as someone running RethinkDB in cloud environments and replicating between datacenters, I think SSL is a good use of effort.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am using stunnel to proxy/tunnel the intracluster communication but this took quite a bit of setup and testing to get working well, and sometimes there must be an order of which things are brought online. So it can be done outside of RethinkDB but native SSL support would sure be nice."
