        "We have a user who tried to connect to the server from the node.js driver in a loop, trying to figure out how many connections the server can handle at a time. On his machine he hits a limit of 242 connections and then gets an error `RqlDriverError: Could not connect to localhost:28015`.\r\n\r\nI suspect it's a file descriptor client issue or some such problem, but the driver cobbles the error message by hiding what's really going on and returning the `RqlDriverError`. I think in case of connect we should just pass on the actual error we get from the OS/Node. Rewriting errors like this makes debugging subtle problems significantly harder."
