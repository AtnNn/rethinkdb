      "I would bet that this is because the client code is destructively modifying a single document, while the server code is repeatedly constructing new documents.  This is because in general terms aren't smart enough to figure out when they are the only ones with a reference to an object, and thus when it is safe to modify that object destructively.  If we fixed that (and I think we have to fix it at some point), a lot of queries (including this one) would probably get much faster.  Another way we could fix this particular problem would be to move to functional objects so that we don't have to copy the whole thing every time we construct a new one."
