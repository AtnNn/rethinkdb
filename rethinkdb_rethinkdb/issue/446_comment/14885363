      "I think that renaming all our protobuf values to avoid keyword conflicts in all languages we might want to provide drivers for is a losing game.\r\n\r\nIf there are actually no protobuf compilers for php which will rename conflicting words, we can just have a preprocessing script that uses sed and prepends a `P_` to all the enum constants or whatever."
