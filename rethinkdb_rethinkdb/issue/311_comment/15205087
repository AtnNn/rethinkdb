      "Assigning to @Tryneus. Here's what we need to implement\r\n\r\n* A `--daemon` option that forks a rethinkdb process and exits only when the log file is successfully created. (If anything fails before that, the process should exit with an error and print the problem to stderr)\r\n* A `--runuser`  and `--rungroup` options that make rethinkdb switch to a different user or group\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, @atnnn will have to change the `init.d` script to use the new functionality."
