      "@Tryneus thanks for the write-up, that helps a lot! I was thinking it would be nice to consolidate things in this PR so that we don't have to pass around the shard/replica params to all these methods, but it sounds like that's a lot to think about.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes are we going to need to wait on `2.3` for this or could we sneak it in a `2.2.x` release? If we're gonna have to wait for `2.3` anyway, then I'll just do it all at once. Otherwise I'd prefer to just get this working as-is (and refactor in a separate PR) because it would be really useful for us right now."
