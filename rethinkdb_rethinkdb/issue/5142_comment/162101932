      "@danielmewes I finally got back around to this and I think it's ready to go. The admin stuff is really hard to test, but the changes were trivial so I'm fairly confident. I have the default values for `shards/replicas` set to 1 so I didn't have to add a bunch of conditional logic. That should result in the same behavior as calling `r.table_create` without those arguments, correct?\r\n\r\nI'll hold off on the refactor until #5147 makes it easier to test/debug locally."
