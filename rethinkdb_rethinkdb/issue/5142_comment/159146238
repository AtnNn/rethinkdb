      "It's unclear to me why (in `_import.py`) we have both a `table_check` method which implicitly creates the table if it doesn't exist, as well as a `create_table` method, which does that as well as builds the secondary indices. If I'm not mistaken we can refactor this to just use `create_table` everywhere, but I haven't dug in too much."
