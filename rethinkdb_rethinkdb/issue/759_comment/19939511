      "The on disk compression would be great too since I can't really do it easily short of some kind of compressed fs.\r\n\r\nI plan on doing some testing this week with using some kind of VPN compression as a temporary solution for cross-node (primarily, it's more because of the plaintext thing but compression would just be a plus too)"
