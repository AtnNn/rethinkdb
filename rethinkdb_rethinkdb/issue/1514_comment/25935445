      "That sounds very reasonable.\r\nThe argument to close should presumably get the same name as the function we add (i.e. `noreply_wait` or `reply_wait`)\r\n\r\n`reply_wait` might be slightly confusing because we do not actually get any reply at this point, but then again it is going to make a lot of sense once we do can get some reply. Either name seems fine to me.\r\n\r\nThe `sync`/`flush` name discussion should be continued in #1046. "
