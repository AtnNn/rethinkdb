      "Ok, just talked about it in person. Here are my revised opinions:\r\n\r\n* I still think `flush` is a much better name than `sync`\r\n* I agree that `flush` should be on a table, not on a connection\r\n* I think `wait` is a particularly bad name and is confusing in presence of `flush`. I'd be cool with `noreply_wait`, or `wait_noreply`, or something more specific."
