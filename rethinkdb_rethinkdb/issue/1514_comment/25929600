      "@coffeemug another aspect of the ReQL proposal rules is that proposing a command and not even giving us a hint as to what the semantics are, which is what you're doing with `conn.sync()` right now, is to be avoided because it doesn't forward the conversation at all. You do this frequently please stop doing it.\r\n\r\nMy best guess for `conn.sync()` is that it syncs all of the tables to disk. For the same reasons that @danielmewes proposal for `r.wait()` made no sense `conn.sync()` makes very little sense, I'm probably misunderstanding your proposal though. If that is your proposal we could easily add something like `r.sync_all` which does the same thing, but it makes no sense as a method on the connection. Also as per the ReQL rules `r.table().sync()` was put up for discussion a week ago and me, @mlucy, and @danielmewes immediately reached a consensus on it. @mlucy and I discussed this a bit and I'd really prefer if you didn't drag us back in to discussion mode after the fact.\r\n\r\nAs for the proposal for `wait`. This doesn't make much sense to me either. If we implement the behavior of `close` including `wait` then we could just as easily implement `wait` and have `close` call it. Literally the only extra work involved is adding a simple method which I think has some use since it allows you to fire off a bunch of queries and then"
