      "Sounds good to me.\r\n\r\nImplementing the limited r.wait() without the return_results optarg should be straight forward. The easiest way is to internally perform a soft-durable sync on all existing tables. It does a bit more than absolutely necessary (1) but that probably doesn't hurt much.\r\n\r\n(1) For example it will go through write throttling and the flush lock. It also goes to tables which previous no-reply operations have not actually touched. We might have to handle the case of tables not being available for writes due to the primary being down."
