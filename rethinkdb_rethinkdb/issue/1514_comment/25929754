      "@jdoliner: Ok that makes sense (assuming no outdated-ok reads, for which the concepts of before and after seem to stop making any sense). I thought I had read about the per-connection semantics in some kind of documentation. But I cannot find it, so let's assume that I just made that up.\r\n(PS: this was referring to your clarification of ReQL semantics)\r\n\r\n@coffeemug Thanks for explaining the ReQL proposal process."
