      "The initial implementation would be to solve https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1388, less as a user-facing feature. However I will keep off it for a bit more so we can at least agree on something which can later be upgraded to an API feature.\r\n\r\nI think `r.wait()` makes a lot of sense once it also returns things. `conn.wait()` just becomes inconvenient at that point."
