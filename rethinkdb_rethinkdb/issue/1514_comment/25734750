      "I think we should keep the door open for later adding the optarg. Otherwise we might end up with two different ways of doing the same thing.\r\n\r\nRegarding the implementation of `wait()`:\r\nWhere exactly is the noreply argument interpreted? On the individual shards or on the node with the client connection only? In the latter case I a no-op on the server side seems sufficient indeed."
