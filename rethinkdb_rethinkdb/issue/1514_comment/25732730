      "We should implement `r.wait` sooner rather than later because of #1388.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should keep the results of noreply writes around indefinitely in case someone wants them.  A major use-case for noreply writes is being able to fire off point-writes instead of batches without a huge latency cost, and we'd end up storing O(n) data indefinitely in that case.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be opposed to aggregating all the stats objects of the writes, though.  That would take constant space, and might be useful.\r\n\r\nI think we should implement a simple no-optarg `wait` command for #1388 and come back to this `return_results` discussion later."
