      "There are also copious examples I can give you of queries that have very vague and difficult to implement semantics because of the inclusion of `r.wait()`. But those are in some sense beside the point. Alarm bells should be going off in your head the moment you notice that you're bringing a term with semantics unlike anything else we currently have in to ReQL. Even if you can't think of the corner cases it doesn't mean there aren't any."
