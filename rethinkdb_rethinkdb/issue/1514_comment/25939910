      "Dude, I'm happy to do it (and I'll try). When I don't, the reason is that it doesn't even occur to me that what I'm saying isn't obvious. In case of `conn.sync()` it seemed obvious that it would sync all tables (or, if we want to be efficient, sync the tables that were written to with soft durability on that connection). I mean, what else could it possibly do? I'm honestly having trouble finding a single other reasonable interpretation for the semantics of that command.\r\n\r\nAlso, for intellectual word-fencing's sake, I could turn the argument around. You seem to be the only one who's frustrated with my lack of specificity. So, while I'll try to be more specific, pretty, please, with sugar on top, when something's unclear, try not to get frustrated and just ask :-D"
