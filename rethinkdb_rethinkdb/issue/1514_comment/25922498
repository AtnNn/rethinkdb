      "We have very strict lines of abstraction in the query language and that's important. Strict lines of abstraction are how you make maintainable code. The query language layer has no concept of a connection, and thus has no knowledge of operations that were previously run on the same connection. That is why having a term `r.wait()` makes 0 sense and will never make any sense. As far as the query language layer is concerned every operation is the only operation that has ever been run and this eliminates an entire class of bugs that could otherwise appear.\r\n\r\nI would actually advise you to go look at this code and understand why this is important. To be honest I think you could learn a lot from it."
