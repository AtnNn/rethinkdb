      "One thing I'm unsure about:\r\n`reconnect()` and `close()` in JavaScript. Here are some options for their interfaces:\r\n\r\n* Option 1: `close([{noreplyWait: true}, ][callback])` and `reconnect([{noreplyWait: true}, ]callback)`\r\n   So you can write\r\n   * `close()` (defaults to noreplyWait: true, but does not call any callback. This still makes sense because noreply writes will finish unless the node server shuts down or something like that)\r\n   * `close(callback)` callback is called as soon as the noreplyWait finishes\r\n   * `close({noreplyWait: true}, callback)` same\r\n   * `close({noreplyWait: false}, callback)` callback is called immediately, operations are aborted\r\n   * `close({noreplyWait: false})` operations are aborted\r\n* Option 2: `close([noreplyWait, ][callback])` and `reconnect([noreplyWait, ]callback)`\r\n   So you can write\r\n   * `close()` (defaults to noreplyWait = true, but does not call any callback. This still makes sense because noreply writes will finish unless the node server shuts down or something like that)\r\n   * `close(callback)` callback is called as soon as the noreplyWait finishes\r\n   * `close(true, callback)` same\r\n   * `close(false, callback)` callback is called immediately, operations are aborted\r\n   * `close(false)` operations are aborted\r\n* Option 3: as 1, but make the opts dictionary mandatory\r\n* Option 4: as 2, but make the boolean flag mandatory\r\n\r\nI think we always want the callback argument as the last argument, so I didn't list any other options.\r\n\r\nMy favorite is option 1, because it is consistent with `run()`."
