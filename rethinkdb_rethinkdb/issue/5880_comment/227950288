      "rethinkdbdash can connect to multiple instances of RethinkDB and round robin the query, but honestly, if you start to consider failover, load balancing etc, this should be done by a real load balancer.\r\n\r\nIf you use Kubernetes, juste create a service for your RethinkDB connections, and have rethinkdbdash create a pool for this service. Then as long as your cluster is partially up (as long as you have the majority avaialble), rethinkdbdash will run your query."
