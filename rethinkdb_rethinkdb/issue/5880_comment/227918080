      "@chrisvariety thank you. Follow your hint, i realize retry is not a good idea, it is really a pity.\r\nhttps://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash/issues/142#issuecomment-133654639\r\n```\r\nYeah, I guess you're right and there's no way to implement this safely at the level of database driver.\r\nI initially thought about a single document inserts/updates, but only adding autoretry to certain operations will only make matters more confusing.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbout \"connect to multiple host\", there are also other consideration, such as use network load balancer integrated hub to provide a single ip to client yet can choose active host.\r\n\r\nIf no any other idea about this topic, i will close this issue in several days."
