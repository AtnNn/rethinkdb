        "Hi,\n\nhere is a fix to the bug 4845 I just entered. I also upgraded the test class to allow \"override\" of the configuration without having to modify any code.\n\nThe idea is to include a file in the root of the java driver called \"test-config-override.properties\" that can contains the hostName and port parameters. This file is git-ignored so nobody commit it to the repo.\n\nIf not defined, those parameters default to \"newton\" and 31157 which are Josh's parameters, I guess.\n\nHave a nice day !\n"
