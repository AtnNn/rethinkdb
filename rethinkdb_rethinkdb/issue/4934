        "Currently I have 4 servers clustered together. Each server instance that needs to access the database has a rethinkdb proxy service running. I have recently noticed that when one of the proxy server has a problem, and then I restart the service, it takes down all of the other proxy servers on _another_ instance with them. As a result, all the servers that are running the proxy will return errors along the lines of primary replica not available.\n\nThis is what I am starting the proxy with: `rethinkdb proxy --daemon --runuser rethinkdb --rungroup rethinkdb --pid-file /var/run/rethinkdb/instance1/proxy.pid --join 10.240.0.5:29015 -o 1 --log-file /var/lib/rethinkdb/instance1/data/log_file` And this is triggered in the init.d startup.\n\nI am running 2.1.4 currently.\n"
