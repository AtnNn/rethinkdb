I could lower that. In the meantime, you could try running restore with --clients 8 or so. The default is 64, so if you're running OOM, that should help. Also, you could run restore from a different machine so even less memory is needed.\r\n> \r\n> I'll go ahead and lower the default number of clients for the next point release.\r\n> \r\n> \8212\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\r\n> "
