      "Hmm...it appears that the restore default number of clients may be too aggressive.  I could lower that.  In the meantime, you could try running restore with `--clients 8` or so.  The default is 64, so if you're running OOM, that should help.  Also, you could run restore from a different machine so even less memory is needed.\r\n\r\nI'll go ahead and lower the default number of clients for the next point release."
