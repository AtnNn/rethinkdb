      "`outerJoin` is a pretty inefficient operation because it doesn't utilize any indexes. If you can use `eqJoin` for your query instead, that would make things a lot faster.\r\n\r\n`.count()` queries can generally not be interrupted at the moment, which is the reason why the query keeps running in the background even after the web console times out. This is a current limitation of our query interruption mechanism.\r\n\r\nNow the fact that this query slows down the cluster so much that other queries don't work (within reasonable time) anymore is definitely concerning. It could be saturating network, but I think more likely it's exhausting the available disk IOPS. Which type of storage volume are you using on these AWS servers?"
