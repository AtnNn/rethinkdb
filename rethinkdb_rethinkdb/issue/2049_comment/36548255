      "@coffeemug yeah closeing the conn would be werid becuse the connection its self would be blocking in the case for php at least. The only reason why i vote more on the side of a new command in the api is is that you may only wanna time out on section. Maybe the part were you go out to all your nodes to read the data you wanna time out but the gmr following it can take as much time as you want. or you want to allocate a max time for each section."
