      "It would be neat if you could do `connection2 = connection.clone()` (which doesn't actually open a new TCP connection) and then do some queries and use `connection2.close(...)` to timeout on those done on the `connection2` object.  But that would raise other questions, like, what is the ordering relation between operations done on a connection and a clone of said connection?  (For reference, there's no ordering relation between operations done on actual separate TCP connections -- this is more visible with noreply writes and also in Javascript and other drivers with a non-blocking API.)  Just putting this out there."
