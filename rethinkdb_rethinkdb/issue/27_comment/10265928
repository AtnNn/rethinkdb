      "@sojin this is because some of the documents don't have age as an attribute and rethink is strict about errors (if an attribute is missing and you try to use it, it'll throw an error). We'll make an api much nicer to deal with cases like this, but in the meantime you can try this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndb('python_tutorial').table('heroes').filter(lambda row: row.contains('age') & (r['age'] ==26)).run()\r\n```\r\n\r\n"
