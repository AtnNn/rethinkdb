      "FYI -- `defaults` on streams could be implemented as a special kind of merge, which would require a new merge function to do right, which would require a map over objects to do right (of course we could also just do it, and fill in the architectural foundation later). Anyway, this is all discussed on google groups, and the link to the discussion is in the body of the issue #186. (Just so we don't lose track of the fact that these things are related)."
