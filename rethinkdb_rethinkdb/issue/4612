        "I've been looking into graph databases that support backends. So far I found two that might be useful. Namely https://github.com/google/cayley written in Go and Titan db http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/ , written in java.\r\n\r\nCayley has the following backends at the moment (copy+paste):\r\nPlays well with multiple backend stores:\r\nLevelDB\r\nBolt\r\nMongoDB for distributed stores\r\nIn-memory, ephemeral\r\n\r\nTitandb:\r\nSupport for various storage backends:\r\nApache Cassandra\r\nApache HBase\r\nOracle BerkeleyDB\r\n\r\nI don't understand enough to weigh in on how practical these would be or how much effort it would require to have either one of these work with RethinkDB, but I still wanted to see if there's something in this idea worth considering. Cayley having Mongo backend might be good starting point, because of the similarities between it and RethinkDB, but I don't know how significant that actually is. \r\n\r\nWe (you) already provide fulltext search thru the elasticsearch plugin, so I taught it's not that far out there to have graphs implemented by providing a backend driver (not sure if this is the correct wording) for existing solution. \r\n\r\nI personally don't have need for graphs at the moment, but I've seen some people creating social networking type of apps at #rethinkdb, so I figured this feature could be something the community might want and have use for. Having RethinkDB as a backend for existing solution might also be good \"for now\" solution in case you plan to provide native graph properties on a later date, since the data would already be in the database and there would be no need to sync between rethinkdb and some other database like we do with elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nThat's basically it. Call it a feature request or conversation starter if that is more appropriate."
