      "I decided to forgo the `deterministic_env_t` since we're running behind in this sprint.  I instead added a sanity check where we used to just dereference a NULL pointer.\r\n\r\nThis is code review 354.  The two major commits associated with this are d912260 and 0245243 (the polyglot unit test was added in 0a18a06).\r\n\r\nOne other commit associated with this (8cd041b) needs to be cherry-picked into 1.4.x as well, because it fixes a bug discovered in the process of doing this."
