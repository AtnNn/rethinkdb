      "@neumino: What you're suggesting is probably possible. I've been reluctant to do it because there are some potentially awkward corner cases involved in storing the server names and keeping them up to date. But now I'm thinking that it's probably the right solution in the long term because we'll want to be able to display the names of missing servers anyway.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug: Earlier this week you said that if we were to store servers by UUID instead of by name, we should also allow the user to insert a config that refers to a server that doesn't exist yet, and have the system do name lookup when such a server comes online. Do you think this is an important use case, or would you be willing to compromise on it? I think it's OK to tell people ``Server `foo` does not exist.`` if this happens, and also this will catch cases where someone mis-types a server name."
