      "I'm probably missing something here.\r\n\r\nIf we get rid of the concept of \"permanently removing\", why can't we keep a global table of servers' ids and names? Is it because it may infinitely grow?\r\n\r\nWe should be able to maintain a list of servers connected, and of servers that should be connected right?\r\nWe can get a list of servers connected (there's a heartbeat), and a list of servers that should be connected (whose id is used by a table). Then we just need to merge these two list."
