      "We need to think a bit more about this. @neumino pointed out that it would be *really* nice for programmatic access to expose both ids *and* names to the user in the config table, and potentially allow the user to change only one of those (and have the system automagically update the other). I'd like to talk to @neumino and @timmaxw a bit more in person about this before we make a decision."
