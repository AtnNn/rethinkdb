        "@fourlincoln10 reported that writes were taking 600 ms.\n\nNotable facts are that there was low CPU usage and that this was on a rotational drive.\n\nNote the gists in the conversation below which specify precisely how the server was accessed.\n\n```\nI still appear to be having some performance issues. It's taking approximately 500-600 ms to insert a single doc. I'm using the latest version of Node.js and RethinkDB. Here's a gist that shows how I'm calculating the timing:\nfourlincoln10\nhttps://gist.github.com/fourlincoln10/5210419\nfourlincoln10\nAny idea about how to troubleshoot this?\nsrh\nlet me take a look\nsrh\nWhich operating system are you using?  OS X, Linux 32-bit, or Linux 64-bit?\nfourlincoln10\nI'm using OS X 10.8.3\nsrh\noka\nsrh\nokay\nsrh\nI use that regularly.  I definitely don't get such performance numbers.  But I don't use the Javascript client.\nfourlincoln10\nIt seems very slow. I initially thought it was the connection setup but I don't start the timer until after the connection is established in my test code and I'm still getting 500-600ms inserts\nsrh\nI'm currently trying to reproduce\nfourlincoln10\nAwesome...thanks. I updated my gist with an example of what I get when I copy and paste the code into Node's repl\nsrh\nI got 51ms the first time I tried running your script.  Then I got 60ms, 45ms, 48ms, 43ms.  That's still too slow.  However, there is a known performance bug in 1.4.0.  I'm going to try the latest development version and see how that number changes.\nfourlincoln10\nI'm not even close to those numbers. Is there an application log other than what shows in the web based administration console? Wondering if that might help.\nsrh\nnothing fine-grained\nfourlincoln10\nok\nmglukhov has joined (~Adium@c-76-126-212-255.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)\nsrh\nperformance is the same in the latest version in development\nsrh\nDo you have an unusual filesystem configuration?\nfourlincoln10\nI have an Ubuntu server I can try it out on. I'll see if that makes a difference.\nsrh\nit probably will -- you don't need to\nsrh\nfourlincoln10: could you try running this while watching the activity monitor?  https://gist.github.com/srh/5211904\nsrh\nit would be helpful to know what CPU percentages Activity Monitor reports\nmglukhov has left IRC (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)\nfourlincoln10\nWill do...brb\nfourlincoln10\nCPU (approx) %user: 5.6, %system: 5.5, %idle: 89\n03:02 srh\ndoes your system have a rotational drive?\nsrh\nthat wouldn't explain 600 ms though\nfourlincoln10\nYes it does\nfourlincoln10\nIt's a 750GB 5400rpm Toshiba drive\nsrh\nokay.  it's plausible that we're doing more writes to disk than we think, for each write.  but it's too late for me to think about this now.\n```\n"
