      "Inserting 10k documents of ~64 bytes each (just autogenerated ids, nothing else), 5MB of space is used for that table (vs ~600KB of actual data). Looking at `ajax/stat`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"serializer_bytes_in_use\": \"4718592\"\r\n\"serializer_old_garbage_block_bytes\": \"241664\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo at least for smaller tables, of 4.5MB used only 200KB are garbage, and the total overhead is a factor of ~7, which is consistent with what other people have seen. At least in this case, GC isn't the culprit."
