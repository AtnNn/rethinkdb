      "@danielmewes -- I have a vague memory that we store documents < 256 bytes efficiently, but that between 256 bytes and 4096 bytes we use a full 4096.  Is that still (or was it ever) true?\r\n\r\nIf so, that last piece of click data looks like it serializes to just over 256 bytes.  If some of the click objects are taking up 4k instead of 256b, that would explain the high disk usage."
