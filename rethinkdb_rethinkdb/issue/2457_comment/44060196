      "@diegogub Thank you for the report.\r\nAn additional question: I saw that you used `--force` in the import command. Did you import into tables that were already existing?\r\nHad those tables been used before? If yes, have there previously been secondary indexes on those tables that you had since deleted?\r\n\r\nThere is a known leak of disk space when deleting a secondary index (the space isn't freed). If you later re-create the same index, you'll end up with twice the space usage for the index.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I've seen higher than expected space usage before. We'll definitely investigate it and can hopefully implement some improvements soon (though as @coffeemug says it will likely take a few months)."
