      ">  That's really cool! Is that something we can merge in time for 1.13?\r\n\r\nPossibly. It needs more testing under different conditions. I also have to make sure it doesn't impact query performance when the garbage ratio is in safe regions.\r\n\r\nDo we want to spawn multiple GC threads only when the garbage ratio is above some threshold? Do we want to gradually launch more and more threads when the GC isn't keeping up? That needs investigation.\r\nAlso i/o priorities need tuning. We currently have two different GC i/o priorities for \"critical\" garbage ratios and low garbage ratios. The dynamics of these will likely change when multiple GC threads run in parallel."
