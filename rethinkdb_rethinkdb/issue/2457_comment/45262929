      "I think the expected behavior is to have tables not use excessive amounts of disk space, and that should work reliably on both SSDs and rotational drives.\r\n\r\nI will run some more experiments and see what impact the goal garbage rate actually has on performance. If it turns out that GC becomes a lot more efficient if we allow for a slightly higher garbage rate, I think it would be worth having it configurable (or some related parameter).\r\nWe shouldn't be afraid of explaining how RethinkDB and its parameters work. We would make sure that \"the reasonable value\" would be the default, unless disk space is of little concern for a user."
