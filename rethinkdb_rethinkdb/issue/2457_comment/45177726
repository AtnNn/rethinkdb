      "This used to be configurable via command line. Did we take that out?\r\n\r\nBTW, I think a ratio is a bad way to expose this because:\r\n\r\n- Everyone was always confused what the numerator and denominator were\r\n- The ratio becomes less useful as the amount of data in the file grows (because the insert speed stays constant)\r\n\r\nI think that if we expose this, we should expose a flat number in megabytes. That sounds much easier to understand (and more useful)."
