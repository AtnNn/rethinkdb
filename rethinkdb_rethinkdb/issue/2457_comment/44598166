      "One problem is that the garbage collector doesn't keep up when inserting data as fast as possible:\r\n\r\nExcerpt from `ajax/stat`:\r\n```\r\n\"serializer_bytes_in_use\": \"1286602752\"\r\n\"serializer_old_garbage_block_bytes\": \"1020678144\"\r\n```\r\nThat means that from the 1.2 GB data file, 973 MB are garbage.\r\n\r\nIn this experiment, I had inserted a little more than 1 million documents of approximately 100 bytes each, resulting in a raw data size of roughly 100 MB."
