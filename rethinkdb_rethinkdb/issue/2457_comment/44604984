      "> I just inserted empty documents, so all I had was the pkey (which is roughly ~64 bytes, plus a bit more).\r\n\r\nAh I see. Note that the overhead is especially high then since the key is stored twice for each document (once in the document data itself, once in the leaf node).\r\n\r\nRegarding file truncation, also see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1830#issuecomment-33084340"
