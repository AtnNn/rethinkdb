      "> The odds for that being the case for a significant amount of space are minimal.\r\n\r\nI see. We should definitely fix that -- it's a huge issues for people just playing around. Here is another example -- inserting 70k 64 byte documents (resulting in an 18MB file) and then deleting everything leaves 6.5MB of disk space. People won't bother to understand what's going on here (nor should they). We should just make this behavior go away by having the GC migrate data to the beginning of the file.\r\n\r\n> Did you account for the added primary key in your 64 bytes document size?\r\n\r\nI just inserted empty documents, so all I had was the pkey (which is roughly ~64 bytes, plus a bit more)."
