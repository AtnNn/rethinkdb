      "After thinking about this more, I don't really like either idea (I mean exposing anything about gc to the user in general). This sort of config option opens up a certain class of questions -- what should I set it to? what's a reasonable value here? why do I have to set this? etc. I think it's best not to expose anything at all, and pick a value we know to be reasonable. @danielmewes -- what do you think?"
