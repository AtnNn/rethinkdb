      "> Is that still (or was it ever) true?\r\n\r\n@mlucy -- At one point that was true but it's no longer the case. @srh made a number of changes and we're now at 512b chunks rather than 4096b. So, if the document is > 256 bytes (ignoring metadata and such), it will take 512b of disk space.\r\n\r\n@diegogub -- we'll investigate and make improvements (there are lots of things we can do), but unfortunately we can't do very much in the short term. If disk space utilization is important, you'd probably be better off with a different database. We do hope you come back and give RethinkDB a try again in a few months!"
