      "I just ran this test:\r\n\r\n- Create a new table (on disk size at the end is 1MB)\r\n- Insert 10k documents ~64 bytes each (on disk size at the end is 5MB)\r\n- Delete all documents but 1 (on disk size at the end is 4MB)\r\n\r\nThis might have to do with some or all of the following:\r\n\r\n- A possible regression\r\n- The fact that small tables have different dynamics because of constant factors\r\n- The caveat brought up by @srh in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/310#issuecomment-21904841 that extents at the end of an empty file aren't aggressively collected.\r\n\r\nThere are still some remaining questions:\r\n\r\n- Why wasn't the >1GB file not truncated in your test? Is the same reason as the small test case, or something else?\r\n- 7x overheard outside of GC\r\n- Peak GC usage"
