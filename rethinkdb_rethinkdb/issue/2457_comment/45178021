      "@coffeemug An absolute number would be tricky, because GC becomes incredibly inefficient if the absolute number is too small compared to the table size.\r\n\r\nWhat could work is to keep a fixed minimal garbage ratio internally, but allow the user to additionally specify an \"acceptable amount of garbage\" in absolute terms.\r\nWe would take the maximum of both to determine whether to increase the GC's aggressiveness.\r\n\r\nDoes that sound reasonable?"
