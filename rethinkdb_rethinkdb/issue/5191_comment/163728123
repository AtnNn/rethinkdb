      "... actually, moving the table to a different DB might not work since it has no available replicas.\r\nIf you are sure that you no longer need the table and the data in it, including any copies of the data that might still exist on other (disconnected) servers, you can instead delete it like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.db('rethinkdb').table('table_config').filter({db: \"__deleted_database__\", name: \"_migrations\"}).delete()\r\n```"
