      "Ok, it looks like this was a little more controversial than I'd realized. It probably should have had more discussion in terms of the interface. I'll revert it for now and re-open #4260 so it can be properly debated (I'm leaning slightly towards @AtnNn 's point of view, but I'd like to give other people a chance to weigh in, in case anyone else thinks differently)"
