      "A fix for this is in CR 3400 by @danielmewes.\r\n\r\n@tatsujin1 -- it looks like it is in fact safe to just totally ignore these changes.  They're caused by deletes to parts of the range that you haven't read initial values for yet: the changefeed logic responsible for discarding changes that don't apply to the current active range was just being slightly too liberal and passing them through (but it was conservative enough to strip out the `old_val`, since it was outside the active range, resulting in the strange `{new_val: null}` documents)."
