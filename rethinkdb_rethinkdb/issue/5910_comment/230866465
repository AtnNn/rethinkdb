      "Hi @chdev77, the latest version of the Windows port has been merged into the `next` branch in the meantime. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/WINDOWS.md has slightly updated build instructions.\r\n\r\nYou might also need to manually create the folder `mk/gen`:\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir mk/gen\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote however that TLS support is not implemented for Windows yet. So even if you compile from source, you can't just enable it. The Linux implementation doesn't work on Windows because the network APIs are different.\r\nIf you're familiar with C++ programming on Windows and would like to work on a patch to add TLS support for Windows, please let me know and I can give you some more details.\r\nAlso see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5592"
