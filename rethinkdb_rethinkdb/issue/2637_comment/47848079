      "@srh and @coffeemug i disagree with just playing aound with the default if ur not going to make it configurable for everyone else. For some people the 250 byte size works exactly how they want it and there application may require it now. Also @nickpoorman docs were on average 89 bytes in i remeber meaning you would have to make the default really small to avoid him being in the index. So the better idea is to allow the user to set that threshold per table and if set to 0 it disables the feature all together."
