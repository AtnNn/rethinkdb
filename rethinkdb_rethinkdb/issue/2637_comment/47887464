      "@danielmewes @coffeemug the reason i think this is configurable is because no matter how much we test for the right value the user will learn more about there data and will be able to pick the number that works best for them. \r\n\r\n@danielmewes whats the issue with having everything outside of the index how does it work with docs when they are larger then what should fit in the index in my application almost non of my data fits within the index. also i would think that the perfomance of getting data that is not in the index depends on the number of records that need to be inspected. if ur able to use ur primary key index and only look at 1% of data to be inspected with lets say a filter then it would be alot faster then having to page all data from disk into memeory to even check the indx first and then they data would be with it ."
