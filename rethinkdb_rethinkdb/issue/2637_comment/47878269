      "Also consider the LBA overhead that we have for each out-of-tree document. Right now we can handle pretty big out of memory databases with a lot of documents as long as most of them are small enough to be stored inline. That wouldn't be possible anymore with each document taking its own block id, unless a significant amount of additional RAM is available."
