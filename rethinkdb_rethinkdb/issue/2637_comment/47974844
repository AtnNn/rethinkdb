      "@danielmewes i know its a pretty low level setting that most users would not play with but have you seen all the small low level settings in mysql. its one of the reasons people always go back to rdbms from nosql because most nosql systems have no settings of there own and there dev teams always think the defaults they set are the best so they are trying to tune the kenrel which can be a mess if u have more then one workload on that server or complining your own version of there code base which is more work then them expopsing configurable options."
