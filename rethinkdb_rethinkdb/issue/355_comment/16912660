      "Yep, local storage/cookie is enough for now (btw @neumino -- which one of the two are you using and why? Is local storage supported on firefox/safari/IE?).\r\n\r\nAs for the settings, I also agree that it doesn't belong in the dataexplorer. However, the little settings link on the footer is just a terrible implementation. It's in the wrong place, when you click on it, it opens a really weirdly styled popup, everything about it just feels wrong. So our options are either to fix it, or to just add this to data explorer settings as a hack. I personally prefer the latter because it's less work, and it honestly doesn't matter all that much. But if people are really opposed to it, we can sit down and work out how to do a good implementation of this."
