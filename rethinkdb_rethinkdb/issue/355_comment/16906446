      "Here's how I would change this:\r\n\r\n1. Don't ask people if they want updates or not when they log in (the dialog seems unnecessary, ugly, and a bit intrusive)\r\n2. Remove settings from the footer (they're ugly)\r\n3. Just add the settings to the data explorer wrench\r\n4. Add a link to the install page to the update message\r\n5. If the user hits (x) on the update message, they'll never see the message for the same version (I believe things already work this way)"
