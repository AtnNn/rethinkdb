      "I'm using localStorage because it's not a parameter that we have to send to the server.\r\nThe browsers that we support (for the data explorer) all support localStorage.\r\n\r\nHere's a proposal:\r\n- No question for the first time users connect to the web ui. That's important because people shouldn't have to configure thinkgs the first time they start rethinkdb.\r\n- When an update shows up, they can\r\n    * Acknowledge the update/close the alert (and we don't show any update for this version)\r\n    * specify that they don't want anymore update\r\n- No more option on the footer or in the data explorer.\r\n\r\n"
