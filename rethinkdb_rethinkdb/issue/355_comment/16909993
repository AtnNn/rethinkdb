      "1. I'm ok with removing the alert asking the user if they want to check update or not\r\n2. The settings link on the footer is just invisible from my point of view. No one reads the footer... It's just there if people need it.\r\n3. I think it's wrong to add this setting in the data explorer.\r\n4. I tried to put the changelog, but it's way too big, I'm also in favor of just a link.\r\n5. Yes, it's the current implementation"
