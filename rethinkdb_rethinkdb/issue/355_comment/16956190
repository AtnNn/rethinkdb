      "Heh, I actually had to look up the word \"scallywags\". That's a *really* good one :-D\r\n\r\nI'm on board with @neumino's proposal. The way I'd implement it is this. When the update message shows up, have a checkbox on the next line that's labelled `Don't check for updates.` and have an `ok` button next to it. This way the user can safely ignore it, instead of being presented with a \"yes/no\" choice which they seemingly have to confront."
