        "Something that i noticed that is not in many NoSQL db's and most people for get about how MySQL has this built in is stuff like MD5. Now i know md5 is not the best and there are so many of them out there but I think rethinkdb should consider some hashing and encryption stuff in the db. One this of course takes load off the users application and also allows for some nice tutorials on how rethinkdb helps with safe password management.\r\n\r\nI don't know how the API should look but should include a good list of hashes and a good list of normal encryption built in.
