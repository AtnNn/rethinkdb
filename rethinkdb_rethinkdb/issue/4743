        "I ran a 15 minute test of the table fuzzer (1 server, 1 client thread, changefeeds enabled, v2.1.x with fixes for #4734 #4735 and #4736), and after about 10 minutes, the fuzzer was hanging on a query.  Trying queries in the web UI with gdb attached to the process showed that while queries could run, most queries that would touch a table would hang.\n\nThe hang was observed to happen on waiting for the `new_mutex_in_line_t` acquisition of a table's `mutex` in `multi_table_manager_t::on_get_status`.  Restarting the server clears up the hang (although it did not respond to a SIGINT and had to be SIGKILLed).  There may be a deadlock in handling table mutexes in `multi_table_manager_t`.\n\nFurther runs of the fuzzer have not reproduced the bug, so it may be that it is very rare given these conditions.\n"
