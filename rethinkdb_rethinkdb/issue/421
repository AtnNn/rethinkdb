        "Currently mutation operations return different objects in different cases. For example, `insert` will return an object `{inserted: X}`, `upsert` will return `{inserted: X}`, `{replaced: Y}`, and `{inserted: X, replaced: Y}` depending on the situation. The same is true for `update`, `replace`, etc.\n\nAll of these methods should return _all_ attributes, not just the non-zero ones. E.g. `{inserted: 5, replaced: 0, unchanged: 0}`. This way people can get used to the object and check things properly without having arbitrary values occasionally pop up.\n"
