      "In any context where a function is expected but not received the driver scans the tree looking for an instance of `r.row`. If it finds one it then wraps it in a 0-arity function. My best guess is that orderby and desc are not currently considered such contexts and so this check is not done. This bug should be considered further motivation for implementing #1196."
