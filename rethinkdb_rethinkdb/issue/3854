        "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm working in a GeoSpatial Department and i would like to know the performance with the Geospatial queries. Do you have a benchmark ? \r\nWhat is the roadmap for the next geospatial functions ?\r\n\r\nI have a project of web mapping. For each pan in my map, i would like to make a new request to Rethinkdb with a bounding box: TileJson or Tile Topojson (I made the same project with nodejs and postgis, and the results is very good.)\r\nWhat do you think ? \r\nIs it possible (i think yes but i don't know the performance with rethinkdb)?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n"
