      "Thanks for reporting this @ColdCold .\r\n\r\nThe `rethinkdb.exe` in the 2.3.4 zip file is actually the v2.3.4 version, but due to an issue with the particular build it incorrectly prints \"Running rethinkdb 2.3.3-windows\" on startup (and it subsequently notifies about a newer version of RethinkDB being available). If you check the web UI and click on the gear icon, it will correctly show the 2.3.4-windows version.\r\n\r\nReplacing the download in-place on our server is probably a bad idea because some people might rely on checksums to verify a correct download. We'll address this with the next RethinkDB point release."
