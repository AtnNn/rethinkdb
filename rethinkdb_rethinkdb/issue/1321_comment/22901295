      "This is less an `order_by` issue than a language design issue. `Order_by` checks the type of its argument, it just doesn't if the list is less than 2 elements long because it never even evaluates its argument. This is the nature of a dynamically typed language, Python does the same thing with its sort function. I don't think we're at a point where we're going to consider changing this so I'm closing this issue."
