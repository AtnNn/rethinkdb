Anywhere.\n<neumino`> Does \"make GPERF=1\" works?\n<bren2010> Nope.  =\\\n<bren2010> Same error.\n<neumino`> If you do  ./configure --lib-path <dir_where_you_found_the_lib> \n<neumino`> Then ./configure again\n<neumino`> Does it still says that you are missing libtcmalloc?\n<neumino`> If it still doesn't work, can you try sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal.so /usr/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal.a\n<neumino`> Change /usr/lib to the directory of libtcmalloc_minimal.a\n<bren2010> Thank you neumino`.  :)  Linking it does seem to be working.\n<bren2010> Oh.  0_0\n<bren2010> neumino`, configure worked, but make failed just now, and it was slightly more helpful.\n<bren2010> \"Use the --without-tcmalloc flag.\"\n```\n\nWe should probably give users a better error I guess or fix how we link libtcmalloc. I let @atnnn see how to handle this issue.\n"
