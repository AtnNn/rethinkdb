        "[Currently](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/net.py#L61) we just use `json.loads` to deserialize json in the python driver. But it would be nice to allow some way for users to provide a custom [JSONDecoder](https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html#json.JSONDecoder) subclass that allows customizing the deserialized result.  This would be useful, for example, for ORM writers who would like to instrument the objects coming out of the DB without having to reconvert or wrap them in a second step\n"
