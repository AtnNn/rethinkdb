      "The current syntax is convenient and consistent, because it follows the same argument types that ReQL has elsewhere. In particular, the current syntax also allows you to use the result of another ReQL expression as the input to `coerceTo`.\r\n\r\nI think adding named `String` constants might be a good middle-ground though.\r\n\r\nI think this isn't very high priority, but we can look into it at some point."
