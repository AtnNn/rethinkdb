      "What we do now by matches the default behavior of most unix applications which I think is a good thing. This behavior isn't accidental it's chosen to be safe because it gives shell script writers a bit of safety from accidentally putting things in the wrong place. Here's a discussion here: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/23668/why-does-mkdir-not-have-the-p-flag-set-by-default-to-allow-for-nested-directory.\r\n\r\nI think this isn't a hugely unsafe thing but it's generally better to model our command line behavior after existing unix applications since this is most likely what administrators will expect.\r\n\r\nWe should just add a `-p` flag the way `mkdir` and `cp` do."
