      "Doing a sampling in which each object is included with a given probability is actually quite easy. It's already supported via javascript although it might be nice to add a macro for it ( :+1: to having macros). For example:\r\n\r\n    table.sample(p)\r\n    #is equivalent to:\r\n    table.filter(js(\"Math.random() < p\"))\r\n\r\nHowever doing a sample which yields a specified number is actually a bit more tricky. For that we would probably want to use reservoir sampling. It's also pretty easy to come up with a distributed analogue to reservoir so this could be made quite fast."
