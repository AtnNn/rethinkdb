      "FYI, one way to do something similar in SQL is to use a random ordering of elements (not exactly the same as sampling, but in the same ballpark). Here's what the equivalent rethink syntax would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nseq.orderBy(r.rand).limit(x).run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would give the user `x` random rows."
