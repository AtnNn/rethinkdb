      "I actually think now would be a really good time to add macros since we're planning to do a lot of ReQL improvements in the near future and having a macroing system will let us very quickly release pretty good solutions to these problems.\r\n\r\nI'm also pretty certain that you're not going to get a better implementation of this than the one I proposed without some decent size modifications to the back end layer which is probably work that we don't want to do right now."
