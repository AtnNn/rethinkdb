      "And I should say that @coffeemug's suggestion is also on the list, forget about supporting the browser environment entirely and instead find another solution for the data explorer, namely, embed node in the RethinkDB server and rewrite the data explorer to pass source strings to the server to execute. I expect that this would be the most difficult option though as it requires only a little less work on the JS driver but a lot of work on the web ui and the server. @neumino would have a better idea though as to what this would require (and he would have to do a lot of the work necessary to get this done)."
