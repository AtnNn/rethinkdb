      "I've updated node-protobuf to handle 64-bit integers properly, but it's still a big question of how to work with them from JavaScript. If you have integer bigger than 2^53 it can't be represented as Number and you lose data. RDB uses int64 for some fields in protocol, but I'm not sure if it's going to be a problem. Anyways, if it is, my protobuf wrapper is ready."
