      "Some rough numbers to report. With the existing pure JS protobuf serializer serializing a small (~400 byte) document is 2,400x slower than JSON serialization. With @fuwaneko's node-protobuf as a backend it's only 14x slower. For a large deeply nested document the same numbers are 590x and 10x respectively. I'm surprised that the gap in performance appears to be smaller for large documents."
