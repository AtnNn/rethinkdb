      "More info to report. I've now added `r.json` to the mix.\r\n\r\nFor the small doc RDB serialize with `r.json` is ~3x faster than with `r.json` and ~22x slower than JSON.\r\n\r\nOnce again, the difference is smaller for the large document. This is probably because much of the additional overhead imposed by ReQL doesn't scale with document size. Here the numbers are ~43x faster and ~60% slower respectively."
