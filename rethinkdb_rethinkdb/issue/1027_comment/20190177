      "@wmrowan I think your results are quite expected. JSON serialization (especially native, I suppose Node.js uses v8 for that) is really fast due to simple JSON nature, and protobuf is a more complex binary format. As for large documents with deep level of nesting it's also expected as it requires a lot of recursive calls, and overhead of function call becomes more significant comparing to serialization itself for both JSON and protobuf."
