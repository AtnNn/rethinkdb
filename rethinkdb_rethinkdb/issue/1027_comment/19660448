      "Sending a raw string to whatever url instead of using the driver is a little of work but not that much because all the callbacks are already in place.\r\nI would have to change a little the way I retrieve secondary indexes too, but that's fine.\r\n\r\nIt would also make the code lighter since I won't have to handle a connection and the reconnect part.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I would be fine with @coffeemug solution for the following reasons\r\n- The code of the data explorer will be lighter\r\n- We can get rid of Google closure\r\n- We get better performance\r\n- And if we have node on the server, I have more chance to get a streaming API for the stats :-)"
