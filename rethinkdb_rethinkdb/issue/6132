        "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am currently using RethinkDB in a three-shard cluster, with each shard having three replicas. My read mode is set to \"majority\" and, although it is clearly stated in  the documentation that this is the slowest mode I believe that for some reason it is too slow(in many cases 10 times slower than MongoDB in the same setup and with \"majority\" selected as the read concern level).\r\n\r\nCan someone help me understand why this happens?\r\nThank you in advance "
