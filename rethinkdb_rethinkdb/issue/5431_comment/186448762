      "@mlucy Hmm we probably could. That would make things easier.\r\n\r\nI don't remember exactly how the shard ranges work (in terms of whether they are open or closed etc.), but I don't see any fundamental reason for why the split points couldn't be proper datums. We would probably need to implement a function to convert a primary btree key back into a datum if we don't want to break abstractions too much, but that shouldn't be too hard."
