The standard way to escape arbitrary unicode characters is `\\uXXXX.\n\nThe server itself does not handle `\\x` escapes in JSON strings:\n\n```\n>>> r.json(\"[\\\"\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\"]\").run()\n[u'xe2x80x94']\n```\n\nThe server also gladly converts non-utf-8 strings into JSON:\n\n```\n>>> r.expr(u\"\8212\").split(\"\").run()\nRAW RESPONSE: '\\'{\"t\":1,\"r\":[[\"\\\\xe2\",\"\\\\x80\",\"\\\\x94\"]]}\\''\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 14: invalid continuation byte\n```\n\nI believe the server should not blindly convert non-utf-8 strings into datums:\n- as the result of operations like `split`\n- when parsing protobuf queries\n- when reading older documents from disk\n\nIt should perhaps convert them to binary or error out instead.\n"
