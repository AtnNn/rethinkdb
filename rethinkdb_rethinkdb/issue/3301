The standard way to escape arbitrary unicode characters is `\\uXXXX.\r\n\r\nThe server itself does not handle `\\x` escapes in JSON strings:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> r.json(\"[\\\"\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\"]\").run()\r\n[u'xe2x80x94']\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe server also gladly converts non-utf-8 strings into JSON:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> r.expr(u\"\8212\").split(\"\").run()\r\nRAW RESPONSE: '\\'{\"t\":1,\"r\":[[\"\\\\xe2\",\"\\\\x80\",\"\\\\x94\"]]}\\''\r\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 14: invalid continuation byte\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the server should not blindly convert non-utf-8 strings into datums:\r\n\r\n* as the result of operations like `split`\r\n* when parsing protobuf queries\r\n* when reading older documents from disk\r\n\r\nIt should perhaps convert them to binary or error out instead."
