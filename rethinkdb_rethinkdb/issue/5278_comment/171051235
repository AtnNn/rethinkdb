      "A few of points to make:\r\n- The RethinkDB server does not support SSL (or any encryption) at this point. We do have an issue to change this, but it has not been scheduled yet: #3158\r\n- Our other drivers have SSL support, but it is in service of Compose.io. They have a system that sets up a SSL-enabled proxy that allows secure connections from the drivers to their service. I don't know that anyone else is using this.\r\n- I do have some work on a setup for testing this, but have not completed it #4084. I t has fallen behind a number of other tasks."
