        "The [page about RethinkDB consistency guarantees](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/consistency/) says:\n\n\"Note that changefeeds will ignore the `read_mode` flag, and will always behave as if it is set to `single`.\"\n\n\"`single` returns values that are in memory (but not necessarily written to disk) on the primary replica.\"\n\n\"`majority` will only return values that are safely committed on disk on a majority of replicas. This requires sending a message to every replica on each read, so it is the slowest but most consistent.\"\n\nCan someone explain what this means for changefeed consistency? What are the worst-case inconsistencies that might arise because of changefeeds using read_mode=single?\n"
