      "I am going to mark this as duplicate, as we already have an issue for including the drivers in the OS X .pkg: #4507 (add drivers to server install package).\r\n\r\nBut I did want to mention that you don't have to instal Python through Homebrew. With a default instal of MacOS X (10.7+) all you need to do on the command line is: `sudo easy_install rethinkdb`, or if you prefer `pip` and have it installed: `sudo pip install rethinkdb`.\r\n\r\nI should also mention that in that same bug I advocate to have the drivers always installed alongside the `rethinkdb` binary."
