So if we ended up overloading map for objects it would likely work correctly for ~half of the users, and would work in a really confusing way for the other half who expect map on a single selection to work like do.\r\n\r\nFor the case of `map`, I think I like https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5707 better."
