      "That plan's doable, I'm already making a simple connection pool in ReOBJ [1] anyway.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm attempting to do something crazy*, which is subclass dict [2] and use Collections to check if it's Mappable or Iterable, do a deep copy, and swizzle some stuff just so I can shove my __setitem__ method in the right place. (top level attribute changes work fine by making an __setattr__, but trying to change an attribute nested within an array/Dict is giving me a headache while trying to figure out trying to work around it)\r\n\r\nSubclassing connection to provide the right decoding would probably be a better idea than using Collections checks, or doing something with a silly amount of overhead like encoding the data back into JSON, overriding the JSONDecoder, and redecoding the data a second time.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://gist.github.com/kamilion/ac8edc4816b8ba16e92e \r\n[2]: https://gist.github.com/kamilion/ac8edc4816b8ba16e92e/8575a604e2b6f47f1bfae52a753c3776d98b2515#file-reobj-py-L114\r\n\r\n* crazy in the sense that this may not work the same in both python 2.7.x and 3.4.x at the same time, which is an endgoal of mine, but still not fully realized but the current codebase."
