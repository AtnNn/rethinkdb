        "We have everything we need to do a constant time out of date count operation in since we store a count of the number of keys present in the btree. \r\n\r\nOne user on github mentioned that he'd really like to have this feature since he's doing it by hand.\r\n\r\nWe could do this in 2 ways:\r\nwe could do it as an optimization of count that occurs if the thing being counted is a table with out-of-date set to true.\r\n\r\nOr we could add an explicit command `count_outdated` which is only present on table objects.\r\n\r\nThe second one seems a bit uglier to me although having this as an optimization seems a little bit magical since it's a different meaning of out-dated than anywhere else."
