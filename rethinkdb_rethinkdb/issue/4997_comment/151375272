      "@danielmewes I just added [tostring.mocha](https://github.com/mikemintz/rethinkdb/blob/d2c883be7ea9b928361eb212409657181b643874/test/rql_test/connections/tostring.mocha) and confirmed that it passes only with the change made here. I'm ashamed to say I used the `eval` function in the test, but it seemed appropriate to avoid having to write every test query twice."
