      "Thanks for the PR @mikemintz !\r\nHave you signed http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/ yet?\r\n\r\nAbout adding a test for this: The easiest option is probably adding another mocha test to `test/rql_test/connections` (the folder is called `connections` for historic reasons, but it's really used for driver-specific tests. We'll rename it at some point). You can look at `date.mocha` in that folder for an example, and add a new file for `toString()` testing. You can run those tests through `./test-runner -i js connections` in the `reql_test` folder."
