        "We are installing a console control event handler on Windows through `SetConsoleCtrlHandler` to shut the server down when pressing CTRL+C among others.\r\n\r\nThis seems to work fine for CTRL+C, but when for example closing the console window, I'm instead getting the following message:\r\n```\r\nCaught signal. Waiting for initialization to complete before closing...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter a few seconds it closes the server. However I think it doesn't shut it down properly. At least none of the usual shutdown messages later appear in the server's log file, while with CTRL+C they end up there as expected.\r\n\r\nI suspect the event might arrive on the wrong thread maybe?\r\n\r\n@larkost first ran into this issue in the context of testing, where we need to use an event to shut down a server cleanly."
