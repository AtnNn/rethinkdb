      "@srh is going to disable the warning for now. We'll eventually actually fix this problem. Presumably this will also become an issue on Linux when the v8 headers are next updated (and will make it much easier to address the problem since I won't need permission from Apple to debug it). We may consider re-architecting our JS implementation at some point too and deal with this then. I'm moving to backlog."
