        "The Java `Cursor` object implements both the `Iterator` and `Iterable` interfaces. However, a `Cursor` is not  `Iterable` for real -- it can only be traversed once and simply returns `this` in its `iterator()` implementation.\r\n\r\nA real `Iterable` would allow the same cursor to be traversed multiple times by returning a new `Iterator` from `iterator()`. Since `Cursor` does not do this, exposing the `Iterable` interface is misleading.\r\n\r\nNote that implementing `Iterable` allows the cursor to be used in a java for-each statement, which seems like a good thing, but programmers generally don't expect a for loop to be destructive i.e. it can only be executed on an object once. So I think this is an argument *against* implementing `Iterable` rather than \"for\" (pun intended!)."
