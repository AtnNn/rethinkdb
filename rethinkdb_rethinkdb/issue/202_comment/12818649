      "It's worth noting that all of these crashes happened before the O_DSYNC and O_DIRECT fixes got in, and also before the F_FULLFSYNC fix to the ftruncate call present in currently-reviewed branch sam_84.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that \"I/O operation failed\" needs to be improved as an error message.  We should include error number information and probably file offset information.  Presumably it's trying to read from a file offset that doesn't exist or a misaligned offset."
