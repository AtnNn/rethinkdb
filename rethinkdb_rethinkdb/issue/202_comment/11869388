      "So, I tried using the data files on OSX and Linux, and the errors appear to be the same, but it's a different stack than the one you've shown.  Trying with different sets of the data files indicate that there are at least three corrupted databases in there.  I'm not too familiar with the serialized format, but I'll keep looking and see what I can find."
