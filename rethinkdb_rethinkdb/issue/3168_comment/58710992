      "I had a branch `mlucy_bench` which had mostly automated this stuff with a mess of shell scripts, although it's probably bitrotted a bit.  It was pretty general, too, so it would be easy to add other workloads as well.\r\n\r\nI can't find the branch any more, though -- @srh, @AtnNn, I remember at one point there was talk about archiving old branches on GitHub, did that happen?  If so, how can we get at them?"
