      "I started out doing an investigation about how difficult this would be, and wound up implementing it all using twisted (partially to host flask, in turn hosting httpbin). So all tests now run against this local server, and the .test files now will start up the server. It also creates a self-signed certificate on each run. This is all up for review in CR 2408, and is on branch `larkost/3047-local-http-server`."
