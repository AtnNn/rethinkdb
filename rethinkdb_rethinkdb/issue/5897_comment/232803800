      "> Would it be unreasonable to just create a service for each pod so that each RethinkDB node has a consistent ClusterIP inside of Kubernetes?\r\n\r\nThat's a good short-term hack, but it causes an extra layer (or two layers?) of network indirection and address rewriting. Performance will be better without it. (People running replicated databases on Kubernetes have complained about this before, although I haven't measured its performance impact first-hand.)\r\n\r\nIt looks like PetSets have a slightly different (but better) API than I thought they'd have: each pod can figure out its peers with [pretty simple operations; `hostname` and DNS queries](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/petset/#peer-discovery). The sidecar might be super simple."
