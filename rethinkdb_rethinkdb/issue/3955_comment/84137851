      "Really, I think changefeed reads should be counted as a separate stat.  The current reads/writes are describing operations performed on the btree/disk, and it would be very strange to have changefeeds modify those stats.  If we put them into a separate stat we could add another line to the web UI graph for 'changefeed reads' or 'change events' or something."
