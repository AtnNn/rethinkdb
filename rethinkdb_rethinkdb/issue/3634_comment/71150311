      "At one point we planned to hide server tags in the web UI entirely, because the interaction between server tags and `reconfigure()` has the potential to confuse novice users. The only related GitHub issue I can find is #3230, but it doesn't include any real discussion of the decision. In retrospect, hiding server tags completely is probably a bad idea, because then it's confusing when a server doesn't have the `default` tag. But given that server tags are an \"advanced\" feature that we're deliberately hiding from novice users, I don't think this is very important."
