      "I think displaying the tags is definitely good. Partially because of the `default` tag, and also because it tells users that there is such a feature if they need more control.\r\n\r\nI think @timmaxw you are right that there's limited value in making them editable from the web UI though. There's no place where you can use them from the UI after all (specifically the reconfigure dialog doesn't support specifying tags)."
