        "We should adopt a logging library rather than use our internal code for writing out out log files. In addition to being better tested we would also get a few features for \"free\", things like configurable filtering and copying all messages to syslog. The latter is probably enough reason to do this by itself.\r\n\r\nI don't have any thoughts on the library we should use, but a quick peek on google shows that there are plenty to choose from."
