        "I was running a write-heavy workload (50% updates) with hard-durability on a rotational drive.\r\n\r\nWith one concurrent client, we made an acceptable 37 writes per second (MongoDB: 45).\r\nWith ten concurrent clients, I would have expected this number to improve considerably, as writebacks should get merged. And it was exactly what was happening.\r\nUnfortunately it was only happening for MongoDB (which got 435 writes/s). RethinkDB could only improve marginally to 63 writes/s, at an awful average latency of 300ms per write (Mongo: 43 ms)!\r\n\r\nCPU time didn't appear to be part of the problem, neither on the client nor on the server.\r\n\r\nIt almost looks like the writebacks get lined up one after another. But I have no idea on how that could happen.\r\n\r\nI will investigate..."
