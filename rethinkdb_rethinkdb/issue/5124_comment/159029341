      "> It could be good in the future when removing a field or enum from the protobuf definition to reserve it to make sure that you don't reuse previously defined fields?\r\n\r\nGood idea! Sorry for the inconvenience this time.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this since there's nothing to do here at the moment. We'll try to keep this in mind the next time we remove an enum value (also pinging @mlucy, @encryptio, @VeXocide )."
