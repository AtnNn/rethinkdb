      "The `limit` turns the stream into an eager stream and stops the transformation from being pushed to the shards.  `r.table.merge.limit` should be as fast as the non-limited version because it will push the merge to the shards.  (For other workloads the first one might be faster because e.g.`r.table.filter.merge.limit` will sometimes evaluate the `merge` function more times than it needs to, whereas `r.table.filter.limit.merge` will always evaluate it the minimum number of times at the expense of doing every evaluation on the machine handling the query.)"
