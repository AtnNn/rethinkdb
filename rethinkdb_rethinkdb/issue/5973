        "- [X] I have read and agreed to the RethinkDB Contributor License Agreement http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis is an implementation of async_run, as described in #4630. The actual code in `net.rb` is rather non-idiomatic Ruby so I had to make some changes to the specific implementation. \r\n\r\nI also went ahead and implemented `em_run` using the new `async_run` to make sure it passes all tests.\r\n\r\nWould be glad to hear your comments."
