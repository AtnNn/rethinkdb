      "Oh actually I was wrong about the message. Its format is as follows:\r\n```C++\r\n\"Duplicate primary key `%s`:\\n%s\\n%s\",\r\n                     primary_key.c_str(), old_row.print().c_str(),\r\n                     insert_row.print().c_str()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the first document is the value currently in the table (in this case locked by Y65eeYfN0X), and the second value is the new document that the `insert` attempted to insert (here a lock for MF2ORuquFx). So that part is as expected."
