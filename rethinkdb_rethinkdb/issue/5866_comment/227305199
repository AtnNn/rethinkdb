      "Which language are you using to implement this? Could you share the relevant parts of the code?\r\nAre the threads sharing the same connection?\r\n\r\nDoes your code ever delete the \"lock\" documents again?\r\n\r\nThe `first_error` value that Y65eeYfN0X receives is definitely *very* weird. That value should never have more than one document in it, and here it seems to just have two documents right after each other.\r\n\r\nThis indeed looks like a worrysome bug. Possibly some sort of memory corruption? I would like to make sure that this is happening on the server though and not on the client."
