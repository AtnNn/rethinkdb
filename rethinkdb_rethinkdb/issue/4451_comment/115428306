      "I suspect this isn't the reason for the failure.  The problem isn't the size of the file, but the size of the rows.  This failure occurs when we have buffered 128 MB of the file and can't parse out a valid json object from it.  I'm fairly sure we can't import rows that large (due to protobuf limits).  I think it's more likely that the JSON file has a syntax error in it."
