      "I suspect an other error, my case is easy I have just one file containing one json structure and not starting with a list. I m not sure that having a limit in term of row, more exactly a json object in multiple file line, is the real error. Perhaps,it is the mix between [{ and not [{ . effectively on the same json I have some json array , sometime in big quantity.\r\nMy patch has permitted to read the values without errors. But effectively , an other patch could be more smart in term of automatic setting. \r\nI'm reading the code to search an other solution. "
