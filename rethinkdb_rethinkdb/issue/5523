        "It'd be nice to be able to be able to control the replication in such a way that you can prioritise which replicas get data first, for example if you have three dc's, and you've assigned dc 1 as your primary, you may only want to replicate tables to one or two replicas in each other DC and the rest of the replicas in that DC would replicate from them, thereby reducing the overall inter DC traffic, and hopefully reducing latency."
