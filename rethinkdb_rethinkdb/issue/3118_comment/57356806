      "Hi @nickpoorman. I don't know if you had the chance to check out the issues related to the new cluster management API (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Areql-admin), but these types of use cases will be *dramatically* easier in RethinkDB 1.17 as cluster configuration and monitoring will be fully accessible via ReQL, so everything will be available programmatically.\r\n\r\nIt's ~2 months away or so, so sorry about the delay on this, but we're super-excited about this API as it will make all administration and monitoring tasks dramatically easier."
