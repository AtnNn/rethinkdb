        "Reported by grizwako1 in IRC, running the following script:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rethinkdb import r\r\nconn = r.connect('localhost', 59435, db_name='test')\r\n\r\nshows = []\r\nfor i in xrange(20000):\r\n    show = {'name': i,'episodes':i}\r\n    shows.append(show)\r\n\r\nr.table('tv_shows').insert(shows).run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults in about 300 writes/sec on newton.  Doing multiple of these in parallel can get up to about 800 writes/sec.  Compare this to the stress client, which can get up to 3k using multiple client connections, yet there is no reason that this should be slower.  If anything, this test should be faster due to the batched aspect.\r\n\r\nIt could be that we just don't parallelize the batch insert, which is strange since this is an inherently parallel problem, all we have to do is not blow the coro counter."
