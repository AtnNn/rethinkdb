      "@timmaxw is working on integrating RAFT into our clustering logic as a consensus algorithm. Once that is done we are going to implement automatic failover natively in RethinkDB.\r\nThis is easier in some sense than using external services, because we can provide stronger guarantees and have full control over what's going on.\r\n\r\nThere still is the general question of whether we can allow external programs to bypass our internal clustering logic. The upcoming ReQL adminstration interface is already going to provide much better control over the clustering from outside RethinkDB. I'll also keep https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1913 open for discussing this aspect further in the future.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this issue is node/service recovery. I've opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3217 to track that (I think this is something we should do much sooner)."
