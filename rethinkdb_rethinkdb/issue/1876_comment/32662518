      "@nviennot -- could you be a little more precise about exactly what sort of support Rethink would need? I.e. what kind of APIs would we have to support, what would they do, etc.\r\n\r\nBasically, I hear what you're saying, but it would be awesome if you could explain your vision of how to integrate the external systems with Rethink. I don't see it clearly in my head, so a little hand holding would help :)"
