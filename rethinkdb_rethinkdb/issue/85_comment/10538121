      "I think this is rather infeasible.  Existing command-line tools like this appear to read the entire procfs, checking each fd open by each process.  This also means that if you do not have permissions for that process, you shouldn't be able to detect which files they have open.  Implementing it ourselves or calling these tools would still have this problem, and in addition will be less portable.  It would probably be best to have a better error description so users don't get confused."
