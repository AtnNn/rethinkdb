      "Hello\r\n\r\nI am a newbie and would love to contribute to rethinkdb.\r\n\r\nFor solving this problem : Can we simply write the process PID whenever acquiring lock into any file in the rethinkdb_data directory and compare it with the PID of the current process at startup?\r\n\r\nLooking at the discussion (based on a solution using process creation time and not simple pid comparison), here is my understanding on how we can solve the problem:\r\n\r\n\t1. Write and Update process PID whenever acquiring lock into any file in the rethinkdb_data. \r\n\t2. Check this last process creation time and compare it with the current process creation time.\r\n\r\nTo implement Step 1 (Getting Process Id) in Linux and OSX :\r\n\tWe can use getpid() from unistd.h as it seems to be available in both OS.\r\n\r\nTo implement Step 2 (Finding process creation time) in Linux :\r\n\tRead proc file system and calculate the time : There seem to be some good existing solution using: /proc/uptime and /proc/PID/stat\r\n\r\nTo implement Step 2 in OSX :\r\n\tI could not find any solution for this, seems like I could try looking into the source of top or ps for help.\r\n\t\r\nWould love to hear suggestions from experienced devs. :)"
