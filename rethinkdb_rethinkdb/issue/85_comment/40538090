      "Normally when I make pid files. the pid file is a symlink back to the /proc/<pid> now when the db starts up it can check if the link is broken. If it is broken then hte database is gone, if the link is not proken then the link should look at the /proc/<pid>/status or one of those files and it will give the process name and it will make sure that its a rethinkdb process and not the kernel assigning the pid to another process around the loop"
