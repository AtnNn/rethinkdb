        "Running a RethinkDB server without the `--cache-size` parameter is problematic because it will use up to approximately half of the available memory. That's especially bad when running multiple tests in parallel, but also bad in general when running on a shared machine (say newton).\n\nSome of our tests already supply the `--cache-size` parameter to the server, such as the ReQL tests (see rql_tests/test_util.py). But I believe tests like `split_workloads.rebalance-2-multi-serial-mix` and similar don't.\n\nPing @larkost.\n"
