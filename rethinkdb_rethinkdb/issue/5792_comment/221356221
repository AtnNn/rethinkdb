      "This is definitely a RethinkDB issue, no worries about your Python coding :-D\r\n\r\nWhat is the line in the log immediately before the Backtrace? There should be some sort of error message there, which might be useful. Is it just saying \"Callstack overflow in a coroutine\" or something else?\r\n\r\nIs upgrading to the latest RethinkDB 2.3.2 an option for you? I'm not sure if this particular issue is fixed, but I think it would be worth a try."
