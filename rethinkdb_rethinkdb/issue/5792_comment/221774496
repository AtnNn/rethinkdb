      "A few more crashes since yesterday but on the plus side, the process didn't hang and was restarted by monit this time, so I will continue to run 2.3.2.\r\n\r\nMax level of nesting in our data structures is `{[{{[{`, so nothing too taxing I think.  I don't think we run any nested queries.  I did write an ORM-style wrapper to the default driver so maybe it's that.  It's very thin though, the only thing it does that I can think might be a problem is that it will run:\r\n\r\n`filter({'name': 'foo'}).filter({'type': 'bar'})`\r\n\r\ninstead of:\r\n\r\n`filter({'name': 'foo', 'type': 'bar'})`\r\n\r\nCould that potentially be a problem with enough `filter`s?\r\n\r\nSource code for query-building is here: https://gist.github.com/skolsuper/98dbb095a9307ae2cce0d15ab91c5ce6"
