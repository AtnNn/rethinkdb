        "We are now serializing the proxy flag of `server_id_t`s by flipping a bit in the UUID. This was done for backwards-compatibility in 2.2.x, to simplify migration, and because our cluster handshake currently uses `(de)serialize_universal` which must not change.\r\n\r\nIt would be cleaner to serialize the proxy flag explicitly. We would need to stop using `serialize_universal` on `server_id_t`, and we will need migration for the cluster metadata.\r\nI think this isn't worth doing for the time being, but we should clean it up eventually."
