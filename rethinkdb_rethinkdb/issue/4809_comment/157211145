      "In review with Marc Hesse, CR 3343.\r\n\r\nAs measured in my Ubuntu 15.04 64-bit VM, memory usage is around `15 + (17+27)*clients` megabytes across `1 + 2*clients` processes, regardless of number of tables with my change. Before, it was around `15 + 17*table_count + 27*clients` megabytes of ram across `1 + table_count + clients` processes.\r\n\r\nIn my specific test case, that meant several gigabytes of ram down to a hundred megs."
