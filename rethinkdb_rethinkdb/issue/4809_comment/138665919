      "Thanks guys.  If you need any help I can assist.  I think the simplest approach would be to have a -safe option or some such that tells it not to fork off for each table.  More complex would be to manage and throttle the sub-processes somehow.\r\n\r\nNote: for context, when backups run on our DB it consumes almost 2GB of memory.  Our db is 346Mb in size."
