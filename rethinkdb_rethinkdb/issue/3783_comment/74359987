      "Yeah. This actually has nothing to do with dropping the table. If you spin up two servers, then shut one of them down, then try to create a table, it will hang forever. This is because it's waiting for the table to finish becoming ready before returning, and the table can't finish becoming ready when there's a missing server. The short-term solution is to bail out early (before trying to create the table) if there's a dead server. The long-term solution is Raft."
