        "I got a mail from aedorn who has a problem with a `between` query.\n---\n\nSpoke with you briefly on IRC (as aedorn) and you wanted me to shoot you an email about this with some info.\n\nHere's our query from MySQL (MariaDB):\nSELECT \\* FROM `results` WHERE `created_at` > \"2014-03-31\" AND `created_at` < \"2014-04-06\";\n\nAnd here's the query in REQL (JS driver, and I've also tested in the Ruby driver):\nr.db(\"foo\").table(\"results\").between(r.time(2014,3,31,'Z'), r.time(2014,4,6,'Z'), {index: 'tested_at'})\n\nI made sure the secondary index was ready before doing the query testing. However, I didn't get a chance to mention before is that we are doing writes while doing these queries (to simulate our production environment.) A day of information (instead of the week) takes a few minutes, whereas a full week seems to never finish a query. The query profile shows about 3 minutes on the server time, and the rest on the round trip for a day of information. Same with the Ruby benchmark. We're also making sure to not query against the newly written data, only the valid transitioned data. I'm hoping that means we don't hit on some index issue with new data coming in.\n\nThis is RethinkDB 1.12.1 (about to go to 1.12.2 - data transition takes some time). Running on an Intel Core i7-4770, 32GB RAM, 1TB Seagate Constellation ES (I have several SSDs that can be used as well, but this is just iteration testing for now to see it work) running Gentoo Linux 3.14 x86_64.\n\nHere's a copy of a document of the current iteration (I've taken out some keys, tried different schemas, and so forth. This is the best one so far but we're missing logs that we need and those must go back in. Unfortunately it increases disk size substantially.):\n\nEDIT: redacting the document for user privacy.\n\nThanks for any assistance. Let me know if you need any other information!\n---\n\nPing @danielmewes\n"
