        "Hey guys. Been having some corruption lately when creating secondary indexes (v1.10.0) on my local box, so I thought it was a perfect time to start doing backups on my live box.\n\nRan a `rethinkdb dump` on my live box and the server crashed. Ok, restart it...nope:\n\n```\ninfo: Running rethinkdb 1.10.0 (GCC 4.5.2)...\ninfo: Running on Linux 3.9.3-x86_64-linode33 x86_64\ninfo: Loading data from directory /srv/rethinkdb\ninfo: Listening for intracluster connections on port 29015\ninfo: Listening for client driver connections on port 28015\ninfo: Listening for administrative HTTP connections on port 8080\nVersion: rethinkdb 1.10.0 (GCC 4.5.2)\nerror: Error in src/btree/secondary_operations.cc at line 32:\nerror: Guarantee failed: [res == 0]  (errno 11 - Resource temporarily unavailable) corrupted secondary index.\nerror: Backtrace:\nerror: Mon Nov  4 20:00:29 2013\n\n       1: rethinkdb() [0x8d66f5]\n       2: rethinkdb() [0x8e32ba]\n       3: rethinkdb() [0x8e8bb6]\n       4: rethinkdb() [0x8fb5f4]\n       5: rethinkdb() [0x427a53]\n       6: rethinkdb() [0x6861db]\n       7: rethinkdb() [0x686340]\n       8: rethinkdb() [0x95ad9e]\nerror: Exiting.\nTrace/breakpoint trap\n```\n\nThis is happening repeatedly. It seemed to originate from this error (pulled from my logs directly after the `dump` command):\n\n```\nVersion: rethinkdb 1.10.0 (GCC 4.5.2)\nerror: Error in src/rdb_protocol/lazy_json.cc at line 19:\nerror: Guarantee failed: [res == 0]  (errno 11 - Resource temporarily unavailable) disk corruption (or programmer error) detected\n```\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have a hard copy of the data folder...so I'm left with a corrupted database. What I'm wondering is if there's a way to recover this data. Like I said, it's the only copy, besides a working dump I have from about a month ago.\n\nIf there isn't a way to \"fix\" the data, is there a way to trick RethinkDB into looking the other way for a second while I run another dump?\n\nAny ideas are appreciated!\n"
