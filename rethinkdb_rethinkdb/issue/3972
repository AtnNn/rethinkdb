        "I've been thinking about a possible integration between MeteorJS and rethinkDb. Meteor has this principle called \"Database everywhere\" meaning that in your meteor application, the client has direct access to the database api. To make this possible, a driver isn't enough, you need a javascript implementation of your query engine. So to integrate meteor and rethinkdb, we would need a minirethink (similar to minomongo or miniredis: https://www.meteor.com/mini-databases).\r\n\r\ntdlr: To do a proper implementation of any storage system with meteor, you have to re-implement your engine (or a simplified version) in javascript to be able to use it directly in the client.\r\n\r\nSo my question is: Is this a reasonable thing to ask for, and if so, how hard would it be to implement ? (I don't know much about rethinkdb internals, that's why I'm asking)\r\n\r\nNote: The rethinkdb changefeed api (http://rethinkdb.com/docs/changefeeds/javascript/) is what generated some interest about a meteor integration, because this solves (at least partially) the reactivity problem."
