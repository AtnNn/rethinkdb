      "What if we have a `.poll()` method on the connection that checks for any change-feed updates that have arrived recently, and calls the callback for them in the same thread? We could also have an optarg `.poll(wait=True)` that blocks if there are no changefeed updates, so people can say `while True: conn.poll(wait=True)` to get an infinite stream of updates."
