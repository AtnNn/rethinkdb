      "Count me onboard for the callbacks for changefeeds option. I'm concerned about making the basic \"just get started\" version significantly different than the code you'd need to write real applications in. It seems the `r.join` syntax does force the user to write a select loop which is annoying and handled by all of these async libraries already.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the users and the driver will be gravitating towards asyncio over time, so it makes sense to align the driver with that api vs. inventing something specific for our needs. A lot of time and thought went into the asyncio interface, and we probably shouldn't waste time coming up with something unique."
