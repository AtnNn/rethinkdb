      "I don't know very much about how Twisted works, but I assume that it would be an alternative to `poll()`. Users would somehow register their connection with Twisted, and then they would never have to call `poll()` manually.\r\n\r\nThis issue is closely related to the issue of supporting multiple concurrent operations. We'd have to update the query parser on the server-side so it reads queries and dispatches them immediately, instead of waiting for one query to complete before reading the next one; and that's equivalent to server-side support for multiple concurrent queries. We could also re-use the same machinery on the client side; we could have a method `query.run_async(conn, callback)` that would internally use the same code path as `query.run(conn).on(callback)`."
