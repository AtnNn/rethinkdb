      "> If I understand correctly, if we pick a single event loop / async io framework, our users will be forced to use that if they want to use our driver. So it sounds better to have a less convenient but framework-independent solution in the bare driver, and then provide customized drivers in addition to that.\r\n\r\nThis is actually why I was looking into lower level frameworks like the async stuff, and also for Ruby.  There are two or three different frameworks in this space (I think Trollius is probably worth supporting, for example) and they are not in any way compatible; making multiple event driven frameworks cooperate is an enormous job.  Better to support one standard way of doing it, and then add support for popular frameworks (like Twisted) as time permits."
