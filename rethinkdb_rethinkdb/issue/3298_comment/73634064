      "In an offline discussion with @larkost , @coffeemug , @timmaxw and @mlucy , we decided to provide an event-loop integration already in 2.0.\r\n\r\nApart from https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3529 , this is going to be the only way to read from multiple changefeeds at the same time in Python.\r\n\r\nWe will be providing an `on(cb)` function on cursors, and integrate with the framework's event loop to call the callback once we get a response.\r\n\r\nAn open question was which frameworks we should support first.\r\n\r\nTwisted seems to be very widely used and easily available, so I think we should definitely support that.\r\n\r\nAs a second one @gchpaco suggested asyncio for Python >= 3.4 and the similar Trollius for older versions of Python. It probably makes sense to support that second."
