      "@deontologician I think that we can get this job done without having a runloop, possibly without even having a separate thread. That being said, I do see an advantage for us to support one or more of the the async frameworks available for Python, and would prioritize them in this order: `twisted`, `greenlet`/`gevent`, then `tornado`. `twisted` first because it comes with Python on most distress, `greenlet`/`gevent` next because it is the most interesting and could give great demos, and finally `tornado` because it is a well known competitor in this space.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an objection to me separating the async aspect into its own issue?"
