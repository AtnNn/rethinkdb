      "I don't think that that is a requirement. Rather `get_nowait()` would only check if there were *already received* responses. In this model we would have outstanding requests for any active changefeeds and either use any call (e.g.: `next` or `get_nowait`) as a chance to do general housekeeping work such as processing arrived packets and then do the check in the cursor. Or we separate that into its own background thread simplifying some parts and complicating others. But in either case it would still solve the presented problem."
