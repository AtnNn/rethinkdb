      "That's not quite what I was thinking, but your idea is better. So `conn.poll(wait=False)` would check for changefeed updates and call the callback, but return when no more updates were immediately available; `conn.poll(wait=True)` would never return. I assume that if the user ran another query, then we would immediately call the callback for any changefeed updates that we found when reading from the socket.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should split `poll` into two separate methods instead of having an optarg. Also, maybe there's a better name than `poll`."
