      "I think we should use callbacks.  They may be nonstandard in Python, but they'd work well in all three of our primary client languages, they're easy to understand, and a lot of our users have probably encountered them before.\r\n\r\n(Also, it's worth noting that we don't need a perfect interface up front.  Historically people have been very vocal when they want a different way of interacting with the drivers, so I would guess if there's a good Python-specific solution that Python programmers like more than callbacks they'll ask us for it and we can implement it then.)"
