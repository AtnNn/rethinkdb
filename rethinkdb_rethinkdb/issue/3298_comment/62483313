      "So the full API would look something like this?\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfeed1 = r.table('foo').changes().run(conn).on(fn1)\r\nfeed2 = r.table('bar').changes().run(conn).on(fn2)\r\nconn.poll(wait=True)\r\n\r\n# Presumably if you call `on`, calling iterator methods on the feed throws\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that would work. It's a bit low-level, but it would do a fine job in the absence of an event-loop, and if someone wanted to integrate it with Twisted and friends, it would be very easy for them to do."
