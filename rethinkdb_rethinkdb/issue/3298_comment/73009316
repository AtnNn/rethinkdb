      "I don't see why multiple `r.join` would be a problem.\r\nThe connection would simply keep track of all open cursors and cursors would have a method that allows the connection to push a result to them. I think we already do this in the current implementation.\r\n`r.join(...).next()` would just make the connection keep reading from the network until it has added at least one result to one of the cursors that this `r.join()` is watching."
