      "@deontologician I agree that we should support those, but I still think that we should also provide a bare interface that allows concurrent changefeeds and doesn't rely on a specific async framework.\r\nNote that the `poll` solution doesn't rely on asynchronous i/o. (Network) i/o can still be synchronous.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, if we pick a single event loop / async io framework, our users will be forced to use that if they want to use our driver. So it sounds better to have a less convenient but framework-independent solution in the bare driver, and then provide customized drivers in addition to that."
