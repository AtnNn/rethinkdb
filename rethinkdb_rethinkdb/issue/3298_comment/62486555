      "Does someone know if such an interface could actually be easily integrated with e.g. Twisted?\r\n\r\nThe way I can see this would work is if the user ran `conn.poll(wait=True)` in a separate thread, and then made the callbacks for their queries insert into the Twisted message queue on the original thread.\r\n\r\nThe good thing about this interface is that it allows different places of the code to initiate their own change feeds with their own callbacks independently of each other, as long as there's still one place that `poll`s the connection."
