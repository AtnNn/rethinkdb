      "Matter of fact, quoting https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types: \"The intention of the protocol is that once an iterator\8217s `next()` method raises `StopIteration`, it will continue to do so on subsequent calls. Implementations that do not obey this property are deemed broken. (This constraint was added in Python 2.3; in Python 2.2, various iterators are broken according to this rule.)\""
