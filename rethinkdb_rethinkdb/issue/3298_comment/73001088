      "@gchpaco -- would you mind posting a minimal Python program that would consume data from two feeds via one of the standardized async APIs? (You seem to understand this quite well, and could probably do it 100x faster than I could research it)\r\n\r\nI'm concerned that while many Python users will happily use a standardized event loop API, asking most users to use them to consume feeds might be too big a stretch. I think most users might just want to write a blocking command that returns feed events (e.g. `join(feedA, feedB)`). I'd like to look at a minimal async program to get a better idea if making that the only way to consume feeds is too big an ask."
