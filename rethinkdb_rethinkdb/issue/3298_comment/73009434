      "Yeah, it's porcelain, for people to get bootstrapped with.  If we do it with some event loop under the hood then they can even have multiple `r.join`s concurrently\8212not really possible with synchronous I/O.  But I don't want to tart it up so it's suitable for every power user.  We could provide an `asyncio` compatible interface for them.\r\n\r\nFWIW it's not really easy to just hook our driver into an event loop; they tend to want to use their own socket methods.\r\n\r\nYour proposed implementation amounts to implementing a miniature `select` loop, which I suppose we could do, but it's still awkward."
