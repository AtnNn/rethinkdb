      "I don't understand how you would use `on/poll` to integrate it with another async interface (e.g. some existing event queue). I think you'll always have to modify the driver to do so.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it still serves (at least) two purposes:\r\n- It will make sure that our drivers are capable of handling concurrent queries, and we can test that in a consistent way across languages.\r\n- We provide a fallback interface for users a) who don't want to or cannot rewrite their apps to use an async library, or b) who are using an async solution which we don't support yet.\r\n\r\nAlso writing drivers for all the important async libraries will probably take us some time, and this will provide an intermediate solution until we get there."
