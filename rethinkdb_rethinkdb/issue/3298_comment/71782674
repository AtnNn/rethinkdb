      "I think asyncio, while imperfect, is a good idea for python 3. But it heavily relies on `yield from` which is a syntactic construct that's not efficiently portable to python 2.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to use [gevent](http://www.gevent.org/). It's python2/3 compatible and allows the user to monkey patch the socket interface to interact with green threads / tasklets."
