      "`r.join` looks pretty nice though for simple use cases.\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage is that all changefeeds must be known in advance, and you cannot easily add another changefeed to the join later (though I guess we could add a method on the object `r.join` returns to join something else or to remove a changefeed from it). The callback-based interface is easier to use in that respect.\r\nFor simple applications that might be sufficient, and if we later provide an `asyncio` interface for more advanced use cases I can imagine that this would satisfy most users."
