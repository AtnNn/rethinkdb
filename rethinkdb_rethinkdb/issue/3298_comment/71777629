      "Reading through this again, I think @coffeemug's suggestion https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3298#issuecomment-62483313 is a very nice interface as a baseline.\r\nOne thing I especially like about it is that we (and third-party driver developers) could pretty easily provide this interface across a range of languages. We could also support it in the Ruby driver at least as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this interface, we can think about providing *additional* language-specific interfaces, such as one using e.g. Tulip or Python 3.4 asyncio."
