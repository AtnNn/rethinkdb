      "I would not use Queue. It is very heavyweight and is designed to be used in multi-threaded code, which the driver doesn't support. It would not work in single-threaded code because both `put` and `get` could block the thread indefinitely.\r\n\r\n@mlucy's idea of using callbacks seems best to me. It is the most general. Users could easily use a queue by adding `q.put` as a callback."
