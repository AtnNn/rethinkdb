      "In person discussions with @coffeemug have revealed he would prefer an interface something like this:\r\n```python\r\nfor index, change in r.join(r.table('a').count().changes(), r.table('b').count().changes()):\r\n    if index == 0: # comes from table a\r\n        pass\r\n    elif index == 1: # comes from table b\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\nwhich I think we can probably provide as porcelain for the user, that would use the `asyncio` stuff under the hood.  If the user wants to do something more sophisticated, they can of course use the `asyncio` machinery, but this may help with complete novices."
