      "Sorry, I did misunderstand your proposal. It would be nice to have `next_nowait`, but I don't see how it would solve this issue. I have realised callbacks would not work either without an event loop.\r\n\r\n`asyncio` seems to be Python's answer to this issue, as discussed in #2622. We could bite the bullet and rewrite the driver to use that model.\r\n\r\nThe Ruby driver also has the limitation described in this issue."
