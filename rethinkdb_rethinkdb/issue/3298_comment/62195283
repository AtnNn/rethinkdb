      "A `get_nowait` operation would still have to block while asking the server if there are any more available documents. I would prefer a solution that does not block.\r\n\r\n> wrap this in a `while` block with some appropriate sleeps\r\n\r\nThat would be ugly and would work in some cases, but when reading from a real-time feed, any form of sleep is inappropriate."
