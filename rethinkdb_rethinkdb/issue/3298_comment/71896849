      "The nice thing about the `on`/`poll` interface is that it doesn't enforce a threading model and can be used as a low level API to implement pretty much any async interface anyone wants. But it is low level, and I don't think it's particularly usable by a general audience.\r\n\r\nSince feeds are going to be getting all the spotlight, I think we should definitely do a better job of integrating into native language ecosystems (which, admittedly, is a pain in the neck).
