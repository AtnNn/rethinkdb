      "> I think `get_nowait()` solves the problem.\r\n\r\nThe only solution I can come up with using `get_nowait` is a loop that polls and sleeps. We should try hard to avoid any solution that involves polling or sleeping.\r\n\r\n> add a `conn.wait_any()` function on the connection\r\n\r\nThis might be a good solution if we implemented #3296. Otherwise having multiple change feeds on the same connection leads to bad performance. We could consider a generic `wait_any` that used something like `select` to read from multiple connections, but that seems hard to get right."
