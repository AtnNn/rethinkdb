      "The difficulty with callbacks in Python (and Ruby by default) is that there is no automatic runloop. So we can't go that direction without requiring the user to have a runloop. And then we would have to comply with the callbacks interface for a specific runloop system, and that can be different from framework to framework.\r\n\r\nIf we want to pick a major web/async framework and make a driver that works great in that framework I am all for it, but as a second driver (or make ours conform to what some framework expects without breaking the current interface). We really do need to have a simple driver for Python for people who do not have something like twisted already running."
