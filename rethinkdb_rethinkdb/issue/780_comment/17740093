      "I did a brief audit of the places where this might be a problem.  It looks like both `do_a_replace_from_batched_replace` and `rdb_update_single_sindex` are spawned in coroutines, which means there's nothing above them to catch the `interrupted_exc_t`, but `rdb_update_single_sindex` uses a dummy interruptor, so we probably only have to fix `do_a_replace_from_batched_replace`.  (I looked at the other places where we're catching `ql` exceptions, and they looked fine, but I might have missed something.)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about where the interruptor is getting pulsed from.  I would bet if we fix this bug and reproduce the error we'll be able to tell from the new failure mode."
