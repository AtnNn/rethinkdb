      "This is confusing, but expected.\r\n\r\nThe \"shard accesses\" metric isn't particularly useful. If my memory servers me correctly, it was added because three values looked better layout-wise than just the two values round-trip time and server time.\r\n\r\nThe reason it is 8 is because RethinkDB internally uses hash-based shards in addition to the range-based shards, in order to distribute work across CPU cores even on a single server. So every table internally always has at least 8 shards.\r\nYou can also see this reflected in the profile output itself.\r\n\r\nThe profiler overall has some limitations and we would like to redesign it at some point. It's just not a priority at the moment.\r\n\r\nShort-term we could replace the \"shard accesses\" metric in the web UI. Maybe by \"number of subtasks\"?"
