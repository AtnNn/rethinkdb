        "Hi,\n\n  I was having trouble getting rethinkdb to compile under OSX El Capitan with XCode 7.1. It could not find the openssl headers so I thought I'd have a go at making things work with libressl instead of openssl. It seems to compile now, however I can't be sure that the SSL stuff is working as I've not yet been able to find how to get things to use it.\n\nDaniel\n"
