      "I can't seem to reproduce this locally. On my setup, the browser sends ajax requests to the same port as the port I pointed the browser to. For example, if I point the browser to some_machine:9292 (and I started the server with http port being 9292), all ajax requests go to 9292.\r\n\r\nDid you verify that the browser sends an ajax call to the wrong port? Could you describe which ports you're proxying and where?"
