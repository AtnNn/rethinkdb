      "So, @Tryneus actually made the decision to do it this way, but my reasoning was this: one of the main goals of these error messages is to have them be legible if you point another program at the cluster port.  If we prefixed the error message with its length, then the message would start with a NULL byte, and I think a lot of old C programs might truncate the error message in that case, if they displayed it at all.  (This is the same reason we end the error messages with a newline, so that programs using some `fgets` equivalent will work fine.)\r\n\r\nI have no idea whether this was @Tryneus's reasoning as well."
