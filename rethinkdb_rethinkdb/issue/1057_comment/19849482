      "Regarding @mlucy's comment, this was indeed why I left it this way.  I considered that a sensible reason to keep the same behavior as before (i.e. responding with a NULL-terminated string).  I understand this is a little annoying for a driver to handle, but it's only at connection initialization, so I hope it isn't too burdensome."
