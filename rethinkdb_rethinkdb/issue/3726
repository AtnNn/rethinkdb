        "Secondary index construction has two major stages, the traversal of the existing data, and then the draining of the operations queue.\r\nI think it used to be possible to tell these two stages apart from the `indexStatus` output, but now even indexes in the draining phase have values in their `blocks_processed`/`blocks_total` fields, making the distinction difficult.\r\n\r\nThis is important for the web UI, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3721#issuecomment-72780629"
