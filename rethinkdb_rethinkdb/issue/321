Name your variables!\n```\n\nThis is really confusing for first time users. (What's an implicit variable, why can't I use whatever it is in nested queries, and how do I name my variables?) We should clarify the error message and link to an FAQ section that describes exactly what the problem is, why, and how to fix it.\n"
