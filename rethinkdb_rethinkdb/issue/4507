        "I would like to add our drivers to the install packages for the server. This would have a few benefits:\n- first-time users would not have to perform a separate install to be ready-to-go\n- it would reduce the number of driver-mismatch problems we field\n- the `export` script (and relatives) would work out-of-the-box and would be easy to keep in sync (eliminating some nasty assumptions)\n\nI propose moving the server binary from `/usr/local/bin/` into something like a `/usr/local/share/rethinkdb/` folder [1], and then put a symlink into `/usr/local/bin/`. Then symlinks to the appropriate `node`, `python`, and `ruby` modules folders would also be in order. We would have to figure out both how best to locate these, and then reliable ways of getting the python files compiled into the appropriate `.pyc` versions for speed since these would be installed as root presumably.\n\n[1] It would be better not to have the folder and binary have the same name, but other than a reverse-dans name (com.rethinkdb) I could not think of anything else reasonable.\n"
