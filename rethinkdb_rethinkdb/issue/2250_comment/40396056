      "I don't think there should be any expectation that the init scripts works unless run as root.\r\n\r\nThe best fix for this issue I believe was suggested by @neumino:\r\n\r\n> If I set the owner of var/data/rethinkdb to rethinkdb:rethinkdb, where only the owner can write inside, the init scripts starts rethinkdb without any problem (and rethinkdb creates its own data directory).\r\n\r\nThis would require modifying the startup scripts for the deb and the rpm packages, and would allow removing some code from the init script.\r\n\r\n> If all of the directories on the path don't exist, consider creating them (i.e. `mkdir -p`)\r\n\r\nI don't think that should be done. One thing that could go wrong is that a typo in the path would not be caught."
