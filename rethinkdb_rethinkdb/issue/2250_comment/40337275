      "Oh, I just took a closer look at the init script.\r\n\r\nIf I properly read it, the init script does create the parent directory with the appropriate right if the directory is not specified (like @atnnn said).\r\nThen rethinkdb can properly create its data directory inside.\r\n\r\nIf I manually create the parent directory and leave root as the owner, the init script will fail to start rethinkdb.\r\n"
