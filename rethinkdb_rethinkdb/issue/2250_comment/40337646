      "> If I properly read it, the init script does create the parent directory with the appropriate right if the directory is not specified.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if the directory is specified? We should bullet-proof this case too.\r\n\r\n> If I manually create the parent directory and leave root as the owner, the init script will fail to start rethinkdb.\r\n\r\nYep, we should change that behavior. When the user types `sudo`, they universally expect this to work."
