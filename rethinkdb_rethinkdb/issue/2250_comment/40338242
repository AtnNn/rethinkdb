      "> If the directory is specified in the conf file, we do nothing.\r\n\r\nWell, we run `rethinkdb` which in turn will run `rethinkdb create`. I think we should consider making a few changes in this case:\r\n\r\n- If the parent is owned by `root` and user ran the script via `root` or `sudo`, the script should still work. Fixing #1722 would be sufficient.\r\n- If all of the directories on the path don't exist, consider creating them (i.e. `mkdir -p`). I'm not sure if that's standard for config files in other projects -- @atnnn do you have an opinion?"
