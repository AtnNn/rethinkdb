      "> The problem is that `/var/data/rethinkdb` is probably owned by root.\r\n\r\nAhhh, I see. So the user sets up a custom directory in the config file, then runs `sudo /etc/init.d/rethinkdb start` and expects it to work (hey, they typed `sudo`), but it fails because we switch to user `rethinkdb` when calling `rethinkdb create`.\r\n\r\nI'm reopening #1722 because it seems to confuse everyone who touches it, including ourselves. Once we fix that, we should retest this issue (since @neumino and @atnnn are saying different things about what the init script will do)."
