        "Currently we convert instances of the node Buffer class to ArrayBuffer before working with it in the JS driver. This is a legacy of the old protobuf library that used ArrayBuffer (because it was designed for the web). We should stop doing this and rewrite the other code to work with Buffer instances. This shouldn't require extensive changes though it means converting the output of HttpConnection to Buffer."
