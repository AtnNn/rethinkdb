      "I'm currently trying to Integrate RethinkDB with Django, and I just ran into a logical condition where I need to check for multiple conditions in a python try except block. Connection Refused, Database Already Exists, Database Name Invalid, and a catch all Other Error. The current error hierarchy is enough, but it could be a lot better."
