      "Thanks for opening an issue @chrisfosterelli .\r\n\r\nThe problem is that RethinkDB only stores the version in a numeric form (as a `6` in this case). So an old version of RethinkDB has no idea which actual RethinkDB version this number corresponds to and how to print it.\r\n\r\nWe will need to change the disk format to include a plaintext representation of the version to improve this. It's a little bit of work, but can be done."
