        "Currently all changefeeds (even point and limit changefeeds) have `squash: false` as the default.  We could change some or all of these to `squash: true` or `squash: 0.1` (or something) before release.  I think we should put a little bit of thought into this because changing feeds from non-squashing to squashing in a future release might break someone's app.\n\n@coffeemug, I remember you had opinions on this, but I don't remember what they were.\n\nPersonally I think `squash: true` or `squash: 0.1` should be the default for all changefeeds and people should have to ask for non-squashing behavior.\n"
