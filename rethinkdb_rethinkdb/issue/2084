        "The web UI sometimes displays a green tick symbol next to the secondary index post-construction progress bar. I don't quite understand when this tick is displayed. It seems to be displayed during the \"Started\" phase of post construction. However it then disappears during the \"Processing\" phase. I'm not sure whether it appears during the later phases (\"Building\" and \"Ready to use\").\n\nI think it should appear only when the index is in \"Ready to use\".\nEspecially it should not appear at the very beginning of the post construction, and then disappear in the more advanced stages.\n\n![sindex web ui](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/505365/2405961/da35c5fa-aa5e-11e3-95ae-2ed3b357b06a.png)\n\nThis is of course an extremely minor issue.\n"
