      "This is implemented in branch ckastorff_4777_getintersecting_changefeed and now in code review 3476.\r\n\r\nThis also introduces a change to the behavior of `getIntersecting` and `getNearest` with respect to multi indexes.\r\nPreviously, geospatial queries would never emit duplicate results. Now they do emit duplicates if the same document intersects with the queried range multiple times under different index keys.\r\nThis addresses https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3351"
