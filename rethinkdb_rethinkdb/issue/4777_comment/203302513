      "There's actually hope again. We found a work-around that avoids the remaining issues so far.\r\n\r\nThe work-around is to internally disable batching for the initial read from a `getIntersecting` changefeed. This increases the memory footprint of a getIntersecting changefeed with initial values, but shouldn't be an issue as long as the result set isn't too big."
