        "I think it would be useful to have a specific exception for when the db connection was unexpectedly closed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this will be a non-issue when connection pools are implemented in the drivers (which I thought I read somewhere, but now I can't find it). But until then it's useful to be able to catch this explicitly.\r\n\r\nCurrently you need to catch `ReqlDriverError` and check that the message contains 'is closed' or some such, which is causing my fingers to lock up. :)"
