      "It's worth no\8206ting that this might only be an issue if network partitions happen in the middle of reconfiguration.\160\n\nI think in practice taking down the application for reconfiguration will often do more harm than the minor risk of running into this.\160\n\nHowever if you rely on linearizability and/or full durability guarantees, we advise following the mentioned work-around until we have more details on this.\160\n\n"
