      "I feel like I might have tried clicking them too at some point, but I don't remember exactly.\r\n\r\nMerging them might be tricky, but I agree that it would be a nice to make the icons and possibly the text next to them clickable. The \"Connected to\" one could just link to the server page of the server that one is connected to.\r\n\r\nI don't have any ideas for \"Issues\", but I think it would be ok to keep that as a non-link."
