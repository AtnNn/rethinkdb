      "I :-1: for merging the two. One is a navigation bar and the other is conveying information about the cluster to you. While I also clicked the squares my first time using RethinkDB, I wouldn't say it was a very confident click (based on past UI experiences) but more of a curious one (\"does this do something?\"), which is why I also don't think those areas should be made clickable without design changes. \r\n\r\nI do agree however, it should probably change with the next iteration of the Web UI. I'm thinking more of a dashboard like this [(taken from Google MDL)](http://www.getmdl.io/templates/dashboard/index.html). One advantage being that the area @larkost suggested be made clickable could be in a fixed position at the top of the page, maintaining that it's relevant in every view. As well, it's easier imo to make this layout responsive should that be something we prioritize. \r\n\r\n![screenshot 2015-07-07 15 26 39](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/863286/8558905/9a11cd96-24bc-11e5-9718-8d65f75bab24.png)"
