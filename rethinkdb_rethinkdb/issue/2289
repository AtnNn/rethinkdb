It may even make it easier to program.\n\nlimit, sample size, sample rate.\n\nFor example. r.sample(100,5,2) could mean. for every 5 documents randomly pick to. but never take more than 100.\n\nI think it may be better to put the total take away outside of the sample so it would be handled like.\n\nr.sample(5, 2).limit(100) this way the it would still mean the same thing but would be using normal reql language. \n"
