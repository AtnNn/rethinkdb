      "Thanks for the report @Cidan , and sorry you're running into this.\r\n\r\nSince the data should fit into memory, the first thing to check is the cache size that RethinkDB is using. If you go to the web UI and click on the \"Logs\" tab, there should be a message in there saying something like \"Automatically using cache size of ... MB \". Can you let me know what that value is?\r\n\r\nThere's another optimization specific to indexed `distinct` which we are not currently doing but probably should do at some point, which is that (I believe) we currently always read the full document to compute the secondary index value, even if we could actually extract it from the index directly without needing to load the full data.\r\nI talked about a similar case with @ha1331, and I'm going to open a separate issue for that optimization later."
