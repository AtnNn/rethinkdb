        "Hi,\n\ni can not rely on just one proxy so I setup three proxy servers and one nginx load balancer. It turns out that, that setup has some problems. My node.js app is giving me this error:\n\n```\nevents.js:154\n      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event\n      ^\n\nError: read ECONNRESET\n    at exports._errnoException (util.js:893:11)\n    at TCP.onread (net.js:555:26)\nProgram node server.js exited with code 1\n```\n\nI was not sure how to setup this load balancing with multiple proxies so I kind of asked and answer question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38411303/how-to-use-nginx-load-balancing-with-rethinkdb-proxy\n\nFunny thing is that this is working it is just after  requests to app goes up something everything stops and I am getting this types of errors.\n\nI have tested connection with Python as well and everything work fine, it is just as requests goes up connection is reset.\n\nI have no idea how to debug this and what to look for.\nMaybe proxy is not designed to work like this.Anyway, any answer is more then welcome.\n"
