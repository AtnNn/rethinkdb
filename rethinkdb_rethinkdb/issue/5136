        "I propose increasing our minimum supported version of GCC to 4.8. It would allow us to upgrade v8 and to get access to more C++11 features. It would require changing the packaging process for distros such as Precise and would make it harder for some users to build RethinkDB from source.\n\nNewer versions of v8 do not support GCC 4.6. A newer version of v8 would contain performance improvements, bug fixes and would simplify the windows port. See #5112.\n\nI was able to build v8 4.7.30 with GCC 4.7, but couldn't find any documentation as to what version of GCC is required.\n\nNode, which embeds v8 too, requires GCC 4.8 to build and uses clang to build itself on distributions that do not have GCC >= 4.8.\n\nWe already have a process in place to build RethinkDB on distributions that do not have GCC >= 4.6. I believe we currently use GCC 4.9. We could apply that process to distributions such as Ubuntu Precise which has GCC 4.6. We might also have to change the default GCC on newton.\n\nSee https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html for the list of C++11 features supported in GCC.\n"
