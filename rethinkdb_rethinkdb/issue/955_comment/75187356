      "Oh, okay, I get what the `r.minval` and `r.maxval` do in that query now - they stand in for the second part of the compound index, effectively saying \"the second part can be anything\". What confuses me is how the query works when they're *not* specified - what is their default value, if not these? Does it look for documents in which that part of the index is in some way not defined?"
