      "Right - I was getting a little lost because it seems a *lot* of this discussion hinges on the implementation essentially being a \"prefix\" for what is, under the hood, one big string.\r\n\r\nFor only wanting a single component of a compound index, I would go back to my initial (snipped above) suggestion to consider using a separate secondary index for just the \"prefix\" component of the compound index. (Granted, that's not a one-size-fits-all solution, especially at scale.)"
