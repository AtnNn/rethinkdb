      "Oh dear, another fine pickle we've gotten ourselves in here @coffeemug. Here's where I think we lost each other: when I said you'd need a way to specify the prefix on the right side or the left side for between I meant a way to specify between whether the right hand bound was a prefix or the left hand bound was a prefix. In retrospect that was a bad choice of words.\r\n\r\nI was saying you'd need a way to distinguish between getting the keys which are less than the right key and prefixed by the left key and the keys which are greater than or equal to the left key and prefixed by the right key. i.e.\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ntable.between(r.prefix([\"foo\"]), bar)\r\ntable.between([\"foo\"], r.prefix([\"foo\"]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou took this to mean the right side of the key and said that couldn't be done efficiently (which is definitely true) which of course was very confusing to me I thought you were saying we couldn't efficiently use a right hand prefix bound efficiently.\r\n\r\nI then realized this was a non issue because saying the left hand said is a prefix is superfluous because if a key `a` prefixes a key `b` then `a<b` so `b` will be included in the between no matter what."
