      "@stuartpb -- because RethinkDB is (mostly) a JSON datastore, we don't restrict you to a particular type in your index.  A \"compound index\" is just an index where the type of the index is an array.  So if you specify a one-element array as e.g. the lower part of your range, we just treat that one-element array as the lower part of your range -- we don't assume that everything in the index is a two-element array, because it might not be true."
