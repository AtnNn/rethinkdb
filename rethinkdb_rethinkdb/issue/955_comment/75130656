      "@stuartpb Thanks for pointing that out. That indeed works (it's basically what @jdoliner had noted in the initial post at the top with `between([\"foo\"], [\"fop\"], id = \"cid\")`, except that you can cut off the `filter` now.\r\nIn fact it's going to become even easier with https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1023:\r\n`r.table(...).between([\"foo\", r.minval], [\"foo\", r.maxval])`.\r\n\r\nThis is still not quite as nice as a separate prefix syntax, especially since you have to use `between` instead of `getAll` and that might not be obvious to new users. So I think there's still value in this issue, but there's definitely a better work-around now."
