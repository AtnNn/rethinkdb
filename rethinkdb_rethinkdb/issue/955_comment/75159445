      "> `r.table(...).between([\"foo\", r.minval], [\"foo\", r.maxval])`\r\n\r\nIs that right? That's what I had written initially, but it seemed to me that even if the right bound were open (which I assume is what `r.maxval` means), that means it's still not going to find things that *start* with the prefix, as they would sort lower than it. Do they sort equivalent to the prefix?"
