        " I can add new servers and datacenters ... but it seems I have to go into every individual table and tell it to use the new servers as shards/replicas .... this seems wrong, it I have 200 customers, each with 40 tables, I'm going to be VERY busy ...  this doesn't seem right so I must be missing something ... especially as every new customer that signs up will get another 40 tables... and so on ...\r\n\r\nI cannot find anything in the documentation that would allow me to setup a \"standard\" database/server architecture - whereby I have one cluster automatically sharding tables, and another cluster automatically replicating tables - or at least not without me going into the WebUI after every table is created to manually set these things up \r\n\r\nAm I missing something obvious?\r\n\r\n"
