        "I installed the Rethinkdb Python driver and no longer get the error `Error when launching rethinkdb-dump: No such file or directory`. And when I run `rethinkdb dump` in command line or in a bash script file, it works just fine. But in cronjob, it doesn't works, no error found.\n\nMy machine is Ubuntu 14.04, I use the latest version of Rethinkdb `rethinkdb 1.13.3-0ubuntu1~trusty (GCC 4.8.2)`. \nMy bash script file `rethinkdb_backup.sh` which work well in command line:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Start rethinkdb backup...\\n\"\ncd /var/lib/rethinkdb/backup/daily\n/usr/bin/rethinkdb dump -c 127.0.0.1:28015\necho \"End backup.\"\n```\n\nMy crontab: \n\n```\n*/1 * * * * /bin/sh /var/www/html/rethinkdb_backup.sh daily >> /var/log/rethinkdb_backup.log\n```\n\nWhen I check the log, there's no output:\n\n```\n$ tail /var/log/rethinkdb_backup.log -f\nStart daily rethinkdb backup...\n\nEnd daily backup.\n```\n\nI also tried `python -m rethinkdb._dump` instead and below is the logs:\n\n```\n$ tail /var/log/rethinkdb_backup.log -f\nStart daily rethinkdb backup...\n\nNOTE: 'rethinkdb-dump' only dumps data and does *not* dump secondary indexes or\n cluster metadata.  You will need to recreate your secondary indexes and cluster\n setup yourself after you run 'rethinkdb-restore'.\nExporting to directory...\nEnd daily backup.\n```\n\nbut there's no file created in `/var/lib/rethinkdb/backup/daily`.\nThere should be no permission issue because I run the cronjob as root.\n\nThanks for any help!\n"
