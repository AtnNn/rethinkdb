        "I installed the Rethinkdb Python driver and no longer get the error `Error when launching rethinkdb-dump: No such file or directory`. And when I run `rethinkdb dump` in command line or in a bash script file, it works just fine. But in cronjob, it doesn't works, no error found.\r\n\r\nMy machine is Ubuntu 14.04, I use the latest version of Rethinkdb `rethinkdb 1.13.3-0ubuntu1~trusty (GCC 4.8.2)`. \r\nMy bash script file `rethinkdb_backup.sh` which work well in command line:\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\necho \"Start rethinkdb backup...\\n\"\r\ncd /var/lib/rethinkdb/backup/daily\r\n/usr/bin/rethinkdb dump -c 127.0.0.1:28015\r\necho \"End backup.\"\r\n```\r\nMy crontab: \r\n```\r\n*/1 * * * * /bin/sh /var/www/html/rethinkdb_backup.sh daily >> /var/log/rethinkdb_backup.log\r\n```\r\nWhen I check the log, there's no output:\r\n```\r\n$ tail /var/log/rethinkdb_backup.log -f\r\nStart daily rethinkdb backup...\r\n\r\nEnd daily backup.\r\n```\r\nI also tried `python -m rethinkdb._dump` instead and below is the logs:\r\n```\r\n$ tail /var/log/rethinkdb_backup.log -f\r\nStart daily rethinkdb backup...\r\n\r\nNOTE: 'rethinkdb-dump' only dumps data and does *not* dump secondary indexes or\r\n cluster metadata.  You will need to recreate your secondary indexes and cluster\r\n setup yourself after you run 'rethinkdb-restore'.\r\nExporting to directory...\r\nEnd daily backup.\r\n```\r\nbut there's no file created in `/var/lib/rethinkdb/backup/daily`.\r\nThere should be no permission issue because I run the cronjob as root.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!"
