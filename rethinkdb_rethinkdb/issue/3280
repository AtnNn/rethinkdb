        "See discussion in #3258. The problem with \"dead\" and \"down\" is that we can't tell the difference between a server that's actually dead and one that's alive but we can't talk to. @mglukhovsky prefers \"unreachable\". I like \"unavailable\" because it's clearly the opposite of \"available\".\n\nOnce we settle on a term, we should try to use it consistently in the admin interfaces. In particular, this affects the `table_status`, `server_status`, and `issues` system tables, and the web UI.\n"
