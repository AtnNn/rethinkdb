      "Yay! This is a long awaited feature.\r\n\r\nWill 1.13 properly and quickly abort when given an 1.14 data directory?\r\n\r\nIf a user only upgrades part of an 1.13 cluster to 1.14, will both 1.13 and 1.14 display a useful issue in the web ui, such as ``Server `Nix' is running an incompatible version of RethinkDB``?\r\n\r\nWe should write tests and update the documentation for this. See #2444."
