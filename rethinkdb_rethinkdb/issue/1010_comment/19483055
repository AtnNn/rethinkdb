      "The actual problem is that making the RethinkDB binary backwards compatible (or even being able to read the old format) is an enormous amount of work, and the format is complex enough that it's nearly impossible to do simple binary rewriting.\r\n\r\nI think we can at least inform people during the install process, which would make things a lot better (this way they don't have to install a new version, discover they have to export data, reinstall the old version, then export, install the new version, and import).\r\n\r\nI'll talk to @atnnn about it."
