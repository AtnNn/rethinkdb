      "@mlucy You guys might have thought of this AOT, and if so, sorry for repeating it, but perhaps you could have a simple program maintained separately that would be able to read rethinkdb dbs and convert them to newer versions. Every time RTDB is updated, you could simply update some sort of definitions for the converter program, and the program would be able to convert any of the older files to newer files.\r\n\r\nAnd when a user updates RTDB, if it detects that only old DB formatted data is available, it could prompt the user to ask if it should convert the data and load it."
