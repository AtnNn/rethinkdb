      "Hmm. Couldn't you have it dump the data while running and allow some sort of group upgrade so that the instance would restart and import new data as long as another running  instance had a replica? This way, while the group would split into two subgroups (new and old), the services would still be available, and to prevent clients from updating too early, perhaps writes could be forwarded to the new while any reads that are not available on the new could be forwarded to the old.\r\n\r\n"
