      "We've thought about this a lot and came up with a way to make future versions of Rethink be backwards compatible. The code necessary to do this isn't in yet, but we're planning to make it a part of the 1.10 release. After that, most new versions will be backwards compatible with versions 1.10 and above. I say \"most\" because *some* changes will still require a migration, but we suspect those will be very rare.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for your patience. I don't say that lightly -- the fact that so many people take time out of their day to use Rethink is very humbling to us, and we feel responsible when some of that time is wasted on minutia. This problem won't completely go away, but very soon it will heavily minimized and will hopefully become a lot less of an issue."
