      "@coffeemug thx\r\n\r\nbtw: Why couldn't we use a modified version of option 1, specifically, make it so each new version can read the previous (and only the directly previous) version and write the current version? Then extensive testing wouldn't be as *extensive*, and ensuring backwards compatibility wouldn't be as hard (or so I think)."
