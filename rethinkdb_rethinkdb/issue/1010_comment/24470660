      "What would be helpful is if someone could maintain instructions for building older versions of rethink on their distribution... I struggled to compile 1.6 on Debian 6 (that not even `--fetch all` could fix), I eventually gave up, and managed to compile it on Ubuntu 13.04 to export my database with a little help from the IRC.\r\n\r\nA suggestion could be *pre-built VM images* running different versions of RethinkDB, this would save many people the hassle of having to build older versions of RethinkDB by hand if they accidentally upgrade without exporting. \r\n**This would at least make the migration process a little easier until automatic migration is possible.**"
