      "Someone has likely thought of this, but just in case, for a temporary solution, why not just include a script with the update/installation scripts that detects if any RethinkDB instances are running on the current machine, and if so, dumps the data, and after updating, reloads the data back in?\r\n\r\nIn fact, this would work especially well with any system using some form of init scripts, because in addition to `start`, `stop`, and `restart`, you could have `update-dump` and `update-reload` which would essentially dump and halt, then allow new files to be installed, and then when `update-reload` is called, RethinkDB could load the data and start."
