      "Hi @hokkaido. First, your data is *not* hosed and this isn't your own fault -- it's a flaw in RethinkDB and we're working hard to address it. The migration issues will go away soon, and people won't have to worry about them again. The decision to temporarily not be backwards compatible allowed us to make rapid improvements since we didn't have to ossify the architecture before it's ready. Unfortunately the downside is people temporarily experiencing migration woes.\r\n\r\nIt seems like you didn't copy part of the necessary data to the new VM. Could you specify exactly which files were in the original directory, and which files you copied to the 1.9 VM? What did the cluster setup look like? (Also, as @atnnn pointed out, it might be easier to do it on irc)\r\n\r\nSorry you had to run into this. We'll fix it as soon as we can. (If you give us your mailing address here -- http://www.rethinkdb.com/community/shirts-for-stories/ -- we'd be delighted to send you a small consolation gift)."
