      "We can easily give the following guarantee: while you're on the LTS branch (i.e. 2.0.x) you never have to do a migration. If you want to move off the LTS branch to the next branch, you need to migrate. We can give this guarantee simply by choosing not to include breaking format changes into the LTS branch.\r\n\r\nI would do this -- it's a good balance between implementation effort, development speed, and convenience for our users."
