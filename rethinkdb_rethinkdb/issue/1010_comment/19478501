      "I completely agree that the migration experience is subpar. Unfortunately an in-place migration tool is a significant engineering effort and will slow development down a lot. My goal is do most of the breaking changes as quickly as we can with the current migration process, and then move to a better process when the APIs have stabilized a bit.\r\n\r\nThis way we can move fast now at the expense of the migration user experience, and then provide a better experience when it's no longer a massive cost to engineering.\r\n\r\nI *hate* putting users through the current process, but unfortunately a better process would slow engineering down enough to make it an existential threat."
