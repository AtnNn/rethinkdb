      "I need my servers to be available almost always, so I can't afford to take all of my servers down and do the upgrade process. What I can afford to do is take down one redundant (backup) server at a time, upgrade rethinkdb on that server, restart rethinkdb, and then have that server sync up with the live server that it's meant to be mirroring. Is it possible to have two rethinkdb instances sync up despite version differences? Otherwise, downtime will be inevitable, and downtime isn't really acceptable for some of us."
