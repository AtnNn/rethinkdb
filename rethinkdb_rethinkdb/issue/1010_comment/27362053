      "For anyone watching this issue, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.\r\n\r\nWe had extensive discussions internally on how to get this done, and I spent a lot of time talking to existing users about it and thinking of various options. Given the impact it will have on development I decided to hold off on this feature for now. Here is the current plan of action.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we release the LTS release (2.0), we will freeze file and network format changes in the 2.0 branch and allow for in-place and rolling updates. I don't have exact dates yet, but the LTS release isn't very far away. At that point everyone will be able to build industrial-strength applications on RethinkDB, get commercial support, and have the peace of mind that bug fixes will not require migration. Until then, this will unfortunately continue remaining an issue.\r\n\r\nI realize that this will inconvenience a lot of people, and will be a showstopper for some people. We don't take this lightly, and I'm sorry for having to do this, but I believe it's the best way to get a production quality version of RethinkDB into people's hands quickly.\r\n\r\nMoving to backlog again. Please send hate mail to slava@rethinkdb.com.\r\n\r\n"
