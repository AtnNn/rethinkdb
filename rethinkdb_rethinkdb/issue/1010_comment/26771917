      "> Just had a bunch of PM meetings with the team. This is both urgent, important, and doable, so we're escalating this issue. Moving to 1.11, which should get some form of a fix for this soon.\r\n\r\nThank you @coffeemug \r\nWithout reliable automated migration, and clusters capable of running different versions of RethinkDB, it's difficult for someone building a large scale application to keep their application online. Even small periods of downtime can cause major disruption.\r\nIt's great that you're finally escalating the issue, once this issue is fixed, a lot more people would be willing to migrate."
