      "I just realized that it's not possible to copy an existing data directory and instance configuration to a new server because the start up fails with 'You forgot to include one of the files/devices that you included when the database was first created.'\r\n\r\n1. Do a stupid thing and update from 1.9 to 1.10\r\n2. Realize that you should have exported the data first\r\n3. Setup a new VM with RethinkDB 1.9\r\n4. Copy instance configuration and data directory to the new VM and set the appropriate permissions\r\n5. Try to start rethinkdb\r\n6. Fail\r\n\r\nSince ```rethinkdb dump``` requires an active cluster I'm at a slight loss on how to proceed here?"
