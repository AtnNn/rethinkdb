      "> it would be a lot of work to have migration script that is not using the rethinkdb binary\r\n\r\nWell, the script does not need to be a separate ruby script, it can be a C++ tool linked statically with rethinkdb core, or a command in \"rethinkdb\" binary.\r\n$ /usr/bin/rethinkdb migrate_data /var/lib/rethinkdb/defualt\r\n\r\nAnother option is rethinkdb itself will update storage when it runs first time after an upgrade. This will make upgrade even more easier for users. And --nomigrate flag to disable the functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I do not know how massive the storage format changes are, so if you think that it is better to delay the task for later I am fine with it."
