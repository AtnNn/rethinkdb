      "I've just been bitten in the ass by this because I have updated from 1.9 to 1.10.\r\n\r\nMillions of records are hosed. Since this is not really a live environment and only a personal demo project so far, it's not that dramatic (and it explains my carelessness), but I'll still have to invest a couple of hours to get this sorted out.\r\n\r\nYes, my own fault. But this should be more transparent. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, the migration procedure as it is now, is rather cumbersome. I don't understand why I have to manually export the data in 1.9. If future versions of RethinkDB can read these exported packages, why can't these versions simply read and migrate the data files by themselves?"
