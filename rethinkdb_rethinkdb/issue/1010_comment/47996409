      "Support for in-place migration is finally in place beginning with 1.13.0 (1.14.0 will be the first release to take advantage of that). Offline migration should rarely be needed from now on.\r\n\r\nIn the future you will typically be able to install a new version, restart the servers, and immediately access the old data (some reconfiguration might occasionally be required afterwards)."
