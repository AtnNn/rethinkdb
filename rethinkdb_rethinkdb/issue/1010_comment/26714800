      "@jamescostian I think that has been proposed, so I don't believe it may be feasible, but something similar where the old version and new version are run simultaneously to facilitate transfer, may be possible. Perhaps run two instance on each machine every upgrade, copy the data, verify using hashes or something, then delete the old version?\r\n\r\nI realize that this would require that a server being upgraded have at least the databases' size of extra space available, but it seems better than nothing."
