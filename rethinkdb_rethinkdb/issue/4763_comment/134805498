      "Thanks @danielmewes for explaining things here.\r\n\r\n> We generally don't allow creating tables with names that already exist. The case where you can end up with this is if you either perform multiple metadata operations at the same time, or if you have a netsplit and create a new table by the same name on both sides of the netsplit, and then rejoin the two halves of the cluster back together.\r\n\r\nI can't agree with this immediately and I'll have to do a few more tests to check if it can be reproduced with a single instance.\r\n\r\n>> Also, my dashboard does not work anymore and it doesn't even have an error to display for more.\r\n\r\n> This definitely seems to be a bug in the dashboard. @deontologician What would be the best way to debug this?\r\n\r\nI moved invisible tables to test db using the command you provided. Since they were just for testing and were of no use to me, I removed them all. Now, the dashboard is working fine. I guess now we know where we should be looking in order to fix this.\r\n\r\n> This seems to be the main bug here. That definitely shouldn't happen, and it sounds really bad.\r\nCould you tell me the name of that table so I can find it in the _debug_table_status output that you sent me?\r\n\r\nThe db name is `learning` and table name is either `images` or `customers` (I forgot) but I think it's not in the debug output since I removed it as it was just for testing purpose. In case it may help, there was only one table in that database.\r\n\r\n> Could you also run r.db(...).table(...).status() on that table and report the output here?\r\n> Despite being shown as unavailable, does running queries against that table still work?\r\n\r\nThis doesn't yield anything since I already removed that database.\r\n\r\nBTW I still have the rethinkdb directories intact. In case, rethinkdb has some sort of logging/journal where it may store the entire history, I can provide that."
