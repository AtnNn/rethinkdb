      "> BTW I still have the rethinkdb directories intact. In case, rethinkdb has some sort of logging/journal where it may store the entire history, I can provide that.\r\n\r\nA copy of the `log_file` might be helpful. Certain configuration changes generate log messages, which might be useful for reconstructing the series of operations that lead to the `images`/`customers` table to become unavailable."
