      "I think we should make the RethinkDB religion to treat nulls in the query language as ugly values consistently, even to the point of dropping the `including_nulls` option.  We shouldn't try to appease people that want null to be treated that way.  They could use some other value.\r\n\r\nIn think if in the long run we aren't going to be pure JSON and have typed values, things that look like `DateTime{ticks: }` or something along those lines (aside: hopefully non-opaque typed values, simply tagged records, not some mysterious magical collection of RethinkDB-provided types), then the user can supply their own typed value such as `MySpecialNull{}` then.\r\n\r\nIf we keep `including_nulls`, can we please rename it?  There's got to be something classier."
