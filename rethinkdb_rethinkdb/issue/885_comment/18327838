      "In reply to @srh's comment:\r\n\r\n> What's actually going to happen is that some people will want to specify including_nulls to be true almost never, and other people will want to specify it almost all the time.\r\n\r\nEmpirically, this is 100% wrong. Quite literally everyone I have ever helped on this (including myself) wants to treat `null` as non-existence. I have enough data on this to feel *extremely* strongly that this should be a default. We can (and should) give people the option to change it in relevant commands with a consistent flag, but very few people will ever care about it in very rare circumstances."
