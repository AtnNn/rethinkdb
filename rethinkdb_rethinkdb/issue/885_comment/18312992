      "So looking at our main driver languages all 3 of them have an equivalent function to this and all 3 of those functions return true if the value of the key is `null` (`None` or `nil` in other languages cases), also underscore.js implements its own `has` function which behaves the same way (`null` counts as existence). All of this leads me to believe that we might be choosing the more surprising of the 2 possible defaults. Would you be opposed to switching it @mlucy?"
