      "> All the evidence I've heard on this issue is anecdotal and in @coffeemug's case has a glaringly obvious selection bias so I think it's spurious to claim that what we're talking about is a universal feature of users.\r\n\r\nThere are rare occasions when I know *exactly* what I'm talking about. This is one of them. Of all my personality flaws (of which there are plenty), arrogance is pretty far down the list of vices. You attribute this one to me pretty often, but on this count you're wrong too."
