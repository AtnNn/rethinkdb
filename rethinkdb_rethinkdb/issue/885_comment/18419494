      "I think that @srh's basic claim here is that just because you personally haven't run in to such people doesn't mean they don't exist. Such people would be unlikely to mention their stance because up until now RethinkDB works exactly as they're expecting. All the evidence I've heard on this issue is anecdotal and in @coffeemug's case has a glaringly obvious selection bias so I think it's spurious to claim that what we're talking about is a universal feature of users. Especially considering that with language design things are hardly ever universally liked or disliked.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't need to be a universal feature of users for the proposed API to be a good idea. You never make every last person happy and I think what we have here is going to do more good than harm. That's a good reason to do it. Trying to argue that a concept we've been trying to pin down for months now is actually as simple as black and white without any solid data to go on is just arrogant, and not necessary for the conversation of this issue.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> TL;DR: I love you as an engineer and as a human being, but in this case you're still 100% wrong.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug this is incredibly patronizing. Please don't degrade issue tracker conversations with comments like these."
