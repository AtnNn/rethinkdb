      "Also, I'd like to propose that we use the following convention:\r\n* A `key` of an object is the string on the left-hand side of every pair.  So `a` in `{:a => 'b'}`.\r\n* The  `value` for a key is the RQL value on the right-hand side of every pair.  So `b` in `{:a => 'b'}`.\r\n* A `field` of an object is a key-value pair.  We say that an object has a field `x` if it has a key `x` which maps to a non-NULL value."
