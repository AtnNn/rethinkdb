        "Ran into an issue installing the Ruby bindings on JRuby 1.7.10 and JRuby 1.7.11. The native extension support in JRuby is being deprecated, so the protocol buffer gem doesn't install properly. Downgrading to 1.7.4 solved the problem temporarily.\n\nSeems like the simplest solution would be to package separate Gemfile specs for a Java-based protobuf library, assuming JRuby is something to be supported. \n"
