        "I found another case that can leave zombie processes (server, python, and shell) behind while testing. `workload_runner.py` has a two of places where it calls subprocesses and puts them in their own process groups. So when we kill off the parent process/group these never get the signals. The answer is the same as before: setup an `atexit` handler to kill off the processes if at all possible.\n"
