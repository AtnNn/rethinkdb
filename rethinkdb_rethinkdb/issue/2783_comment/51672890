      "Ok, finally got around to this!  This has been approved in review 1921 and merged to `next` in commit 8aa7ee1.  Cherry-picked into `v1.14.x` in commit 7cb0b50.  Will be in release 1.14.\r\n\r\nNote for anyone using an older version of the python driver: since we use `tempfile.mkdtemp`, you can specify this using environment variables (see https://docs.python.org/2/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.tempdir).\r\n\r\nThanks for bringing this to our attention, @bigtree3131!"
