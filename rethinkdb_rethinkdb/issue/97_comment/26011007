      "If you lower the cache size for the tables, it should definitely help with memory usage. That being said, there are two things to add here:\r\n\r\n* We can improve overall memory usage on complex queries -- it's being tracked in #1528 \r\n* For now Rethink still has large memory requirements, so 2GB is unfortunately cutting it close\r\n\r\nI'd try lowering the cache size first -- cut it to 250MB. After this issue and #1528 is fixed, this problem should go away. Sorry you're running into this."
