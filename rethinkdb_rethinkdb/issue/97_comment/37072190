      "The damping factor is to prevent a total rebalance happening in a single tick.  For example, there are 3 tables (A, B, and C) in a cluster, each running a normal amount of traffic.  A's traffic stops for a few seconds, then resumes again.  Without the damping factor, A would be immediately reduced to the minimum cache size and forced to evict most of its data, while B and C are given more cache size.  When traffic resumes on A, it would have to rebuild its cache.\r\n\r\nIn addition, without damping, it is far more likely that cache sizes will overshoot the 'optimal' value and oscillate, which is fairly bad.\r\n\r\nThe 2MB base size value came from the old minimum cache_size, which was 16 MB per table.  Seeing as we have 8 hash shards, that seemed reasonable.  I'm not entirely sure how the cache would handle large rows like that, perhaps @danielmewes or @srh knows."
