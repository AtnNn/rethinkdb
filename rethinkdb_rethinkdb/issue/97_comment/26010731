      "When:\r\n\r\n* 1.10\r\n* digitalocean 2GB VPS, Ubuntu 13.04 Raring x64\r\n* 1 db, 1 table with ~3.8m documents for a size-on-disk of about 1.2gb\r\n\r\nI can reliably OOM crash rethink by issuing: `r.db('polyglots').table('users').orderBy(r.desc('id')).limit(5)`\r\n\r\nHaving been through #1529, I now know that I should have been explicitly specifying the index, and indeed queries using the index are fast and fine.\r\n\r\nThat being said, being able to crash rethink with an errant query on a box with sufficient RAM makes me itchy.\r\n\r\nAny guidance on how to prevent this sort of thing from happening until the work in this ticket lands? Should I be using a lower-than-default cache size for my tables?"
