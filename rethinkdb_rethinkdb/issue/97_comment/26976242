      "@dbettin sorry I didn't get back to you sooner about which functions take up a lot of RAM. I just got to thinking about it right now and realized it's fairly impossible to tell unless you just learn the rules for every function on a case by case basis. Furthermore there are several functions which currently leak memory until the connection they're called from are closed. We're currently discussing it in issue #1567. Please come weigh in if this is important to you."
