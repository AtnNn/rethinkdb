      "Not sure what is the state of this issue but I just wanted to say that this took my complete surprise. My DB servers have 8GB of ram but I had upwards of 100 tables. After some time the servers would fill all ram and spill to swap and the entire db become unusable shortly thereafter. Finding that I need to set the cache size of the tables was quite unexpected and setting the value of the cache is not something I can easily reason about.\r\n\r\nPlease fix this, it's too big of a hurdle for the users."
