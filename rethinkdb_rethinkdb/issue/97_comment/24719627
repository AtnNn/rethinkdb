      "You could say that the current TODO list for this issue is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Get the per-thread global page replacement object communicating with caches and doing replacing.\r\n2. Get global communication working.\r\n4. Optimize global communication, even under heavy load, by modifying the message hub.  (This does not steal performance or priority from other message hub users.)\r\n\r\nRight now I'm working on step 0: having the caches actually account for all the pages they have in memory with their own page_repl_random_t's (which right now they don't do after loading evicted snapshot pages back into memory)."
