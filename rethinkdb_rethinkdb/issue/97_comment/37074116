      "I don't think it's too large, especially for servers with a large amount of cache (which is what I think we should be optimizing for).  From the graph I posted, you can see that every minute, the cache will move to 75% of its target value.  Keep in mind that this algorithm will result in a negative feedback loop, that having a larger cache will result in less evictions, and the target size will be lessened.  This means that in practice, the target value will be approached even faster."
