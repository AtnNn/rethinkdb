      "@jdoliner -- could you explain how the caching algorithm will work? (Not the bit of changing the limits in a cache because that's pretty obvious, but the algorithm for actually changing the numbers).\r\n\r\nThis seems non-trivial as there are a bunch of options on how to do this that pretty seriously impacts the users. I have a few ideas on this, and I know @srh did too. I'd like for people to have the opportunity to debate these ideas."
