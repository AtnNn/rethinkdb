      "@jdoliner -- it's mostly nailed down (in that existing issues there like performance won't be moved out of 1.9). However, I don't think there's enough work for everyone there, and I'm still unsure about these three things:\r\n\r\n* Hash sharding (or improving or sharding/rebalancing algorithm in general)\r\n* Automatic failover pre-2.0\r\n* Assigning primaries/constraint management for primaries\r\n\r\nThese three make me feel really uneasy (in that I think we'd have an absolutely rock-solid product with them, and I'm worried about cutting corners on these three issues pre 2.0). I'd like everyone to be involved in deciding what to do here."
