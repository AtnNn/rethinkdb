      "> It gets to be a bit of a problem when you get around 20 shards but I think we can live with that.\r\n\r\nI agree this isn't a problem. If we have a good balance for 8 shards, we'll be ok.\r\n\r\nI actually feel quite a bit less stressed about this once I wrote out https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/97#issuecomment-22941125 (possibly because writing down concerns helps alleviate them?) Another option we might have is to break down our release labels into two that would communicate where the product is to people (e.g. \"production-ready\" and \"high scale-ready\", though we should probably come up with better names). I'll think about this a bit more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
