      "@idan -- there are two ways to change the cache size:\r\n\r\n* The first way is to reinsert the data into a new table. Once you create a new table, you can do it as follows: `r.table('new').insert(r.table('old'))`.\r\n* The second way is to do a curl request to change the metadata directly, and then restart the server. This is undocumented, so a bit esoteric. See the comment here for instructions: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1385#issuecomment-23746168\r\n\r\nThe recommended minimum memory size right now is 2GB (although many people get away with running on a 512MB node). If you have a lot of data and are doing large range queries, the memory can peak significantly, so the more RAM you have, the better. We'll fix these problems shortly, so I'm sorry you have to deal with this for now."
