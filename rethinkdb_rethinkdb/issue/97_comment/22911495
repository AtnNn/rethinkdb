      "I've been procrastinating on nailing down 1.9 features because I'm not 100% sure what the most important things are. I'm going to make post-it notes with all the features tonight, splash them on the wall, and then move them around until I'm moderately happy. We should all get together tomorrow for ~15m and finalize 1.9."
