      "I really think we should ignore these 3 issues. And the remainder of this cache quota issue. It's not that I don't think they're important they definitely are and there will definitely be some people who say \"I'm not using this because it doesn't have Automatic failover\" and there's probably even going to be some people who say: \"Wow, these RethinkDB hacks consider this project production ready and it doesn't even have automatic failover I'm never using another Rethink product again.\" But we know that's not everyone, we know there are already people who use the product as it is in production and absolutely love it. And we know there are many others who want to use it in production but don't because it's not production ready.\r\n\r\nI just don't see an upside to delaying 2.0 for these issues. None of these issues are simple. They're all going to require a long design phase which will probably take on the order of a few weeks. Implementation could take a few months for each and the part that really scares me is that past experience has shown that you always need a few more months of working out bugs that have arisen during implementation. This is likely with all of these because they touch very complicated parts of the codebase.\r\n\r\nEDIT: redacted by @coffeemug with @jdoliner's permission to remove some info."
