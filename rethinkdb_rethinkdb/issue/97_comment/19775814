      "We already turn off DIRECT_IO on systems that don't support it (e.g.\r\nencrypted file systems), but there is currently no setting to explicitly\r\nturn it off. Normally you wouldn't want to do that because the RethinkDB\r\ncaching system outperforms the page cache for db use cases (because it's\r\ngot more information than the page cache). Is there an example use case for\r\nwhy you might want to turn it off?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Jun 20, 2013 at 5:42 AM, Artem <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> once you reach a certain table size, your queries will become incredibly\r\n> slow even on systems with much memory\r\n>\r\n> BTW, is there an issue to make the direct-io optional?
