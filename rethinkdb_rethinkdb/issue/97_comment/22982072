      "So I actually just tested this, unbalanced shards are a pretty minor problem when your keys are uniformly distributed random strings. It gets to be a bit of a problem when you get around 20 shards but I think we can live with that. And I bet just doing a distribution read with a higher accuracy when users ask for that many shards would solve the problem."
