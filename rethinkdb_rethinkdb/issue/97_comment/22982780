      "I think basically we can choose between the following 2 outcomes 6 months from now, these are best case outcomes we could also fail to accomplish them. We could either have hit 2.0 and have a small group of people using us in production, paying use for it, loving it and telling other people. Or we could work on these features have a more feature rich product and have more people interested in our product than we have now but still not have converted as many of them to paying customers.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I feel the way I do is that I put a *much* higher value on each one of those paying customers than I do on users who are interested in using the product. We're clearly going to do all of the things we're talking about now. It's just a question of what the benefits are for scheduling one ahead of the other. The benefit of hitting 2.0 before these features is that we start shifting people's perceptions earlier, and we start learning how to make this jump. The benefit of doing the features before we hit production readiness is that we grow the number of people who are interested in the project but I don't think we'll grow the number of people who are willing to pay for the product very much because most of the people who need these features probably are also going to want us to be production ready. To me the first benefit vastly outweighs the second."
