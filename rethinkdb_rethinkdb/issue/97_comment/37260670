      "@Tryneus -- I originally thought it should be the same units the user passes on the command line, but I'm not overly attached to that. I think our directory/stats/etc currently have no standard -- they sometimes return bytes, sometimes blocks, sometimes megabytes. We should standardize it all (and will) for monitoring, but for the moment you should use whatever makes the most sense to you."
