      "Not having to rebalance shards is admittedly awesome but if this is a big deal for people then using autogenerated primary keys would actually solve it very well and you can create a secondary index on the field you want to be the primary key. It's not an ideal solution but I think it's a workable solution that saves us a lot of work.\r\n\r\nIt may well have better performance but I haven't seen any benchmarks that show this as the bottle neck. I'm pretty sure there are much more pressing performance issues.\r\n\r\nRipping out the suggester is also really nice but again, I don't think it's worth delaying.\r\n\r\n"
