      "Just my point of view:\r\nAutomatic failover -- it's nice, but it's a feature and we don't need it to label production ready.\r\nBetter constraints on primaries -- It's a feature, we can do it if we have time, but it shouldn't prevent us from hiting 2.0\r\nHash shards -- It depends, how much work will it be to be backward compatible when we are going to switch? (if we switch post 2.0)\r\n\r\nAlso hash shards are useful when you want to increase your number of shards. You just have to move 1/(n+1) of your data which is really cool.\r\n\r\nIf we remove the suggester, I would be happy to remove the code of the suggester, but that's not a good reason to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the precision of the hash shards: The only thing that we could make better is to compute the middle (or whatever percentage) between two keys instead of only using the keys in `ajax/distribution` (but what's the middle of a date/string, string/number, date/number? -- we can assume that people only have one type of PK though)."
