      "Unfortunately that's still going to be an issue after the cache quota is fixed and adjusting the cache quota won't help with this.\r\n\r\nThis will be fixed by #1375 which will cap the amount of memory a query can use. At which point this shouldn't be a problem. Until then I could give you a rundown of which queries take a lot of memory if you'd like. Also as @coffeemug mentioned 2GB is cutting it a bit close for Rethink right now."
