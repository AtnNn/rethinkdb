      "Thanks!! It would be pretty hard to break out the caching system into another process, but it's a really interesting idea.\r\n\r\nI think the solution we'll go with here is to limit the cache size on a per-machine basis, and allow tables to steal cache space from each other (this is the way all other db systems with a custom caching scheme do it). This isn't too difficult to do, and really is just a matter of doing it :)"
