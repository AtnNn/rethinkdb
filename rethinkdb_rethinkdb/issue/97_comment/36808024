      "@coffeemug, I have the architecture figured out and mostly implemented.  The algorithm I have now for choosing cache sizes could use some improvement, but it should be fairly easy to modify.  Talked with @srh about involving the LRUness of a given cache, and it could be fit into the architecture, but actually figuring out how to calculate that in a reasonably efficient manner is difficult.\r\n\r\nWill probably be up in code review tonight."
