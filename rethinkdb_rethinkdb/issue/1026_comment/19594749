      "With the C extension approach I'm seeing a 60% improvement in the time it takes to reflect a large document to and from the server. When I test just the serializer independently (no querying the server) it's a 38x improvement. I'll see if I can carve out some time with @atnnn tomorrow to figure out how to package this appropriately for distribution."
