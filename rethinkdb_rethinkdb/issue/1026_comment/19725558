      "Another option would be to write a C/C++ module for Python that takes our native python types and converts them to protobufs directly. This would entirely sidestep the 18x conversion process to rql datums and the 94x conversion process to protobufs.\r\n\r\nPresumably we'd also do this for Ruby and JS. It's a non-trivial amount of work, but it doesn't seem too hard, and it seems like it would be the right thing to do."
