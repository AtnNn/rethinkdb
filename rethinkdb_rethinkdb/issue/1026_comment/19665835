      "I'm getting a bit confused about what everything means here. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* You refer to the C++ backend and C backend. Are these different things?\r\n* You mentioned a 38x improvement and a 130x improvement. What specifically are these numbers for and why are they different?\r\n* This morning we tried a large document test on our Python driver with the C (C++?) backend, and it appeared quadratic. Is this fixed/was this an oversight, or is this still a problem?\r\n\r\nAs for errors on depth beyond 60, I think that's ok. We should just give a clear error to people and tell them to use `r.json` for documents of that depth. (Assuming we work out quadratic performance issues -- I still don't understand what's going on here)"
