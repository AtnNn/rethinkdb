      "That approach is not necessarily an automatic win. It could be that creating the protobuf objects is so slow because some work that is anyway necessary for serialization is done at that stage. Whether or not we can avoid copying the data at least once before serialization depends on how the C++ API is structured. It may be that the C++ lib requires that we create a full protobuf message object for each Python object before we can serialize it anyway."
