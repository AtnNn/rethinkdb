      "I helped @wmrowan package the new python driver with the C++ backend for pip. The driver will fall back to using the python implementation of protobuf if:\r\n\r\n* the protobuf python module does not include the experimental C++ extension (this is the default).\r\n* pip is unable to build the C++ code.\r\n* the system protobuf library has a different version.\r\n\r\nWe exposed the r.protobuf_implementation variable, which has the value \"cpp\" or \"py\".\r\n\r\nTo force the driver to use a specific protobuf implementation, set the environment variable PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION to \"cpp\" or \"py\". This is the behaviour of the protobuf module.\r\n\r\nI have to document this on the website."
