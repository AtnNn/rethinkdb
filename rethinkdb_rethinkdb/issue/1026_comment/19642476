      "So the bump library doesn't suffer from the nesting depth limit but it's serializer is a lot slower than the google serializer. The gap gets worse with nesting depth. I see two ways forward. Either try to figure out why bump's serializer is slow and fix it or figure out why google has a nesting limit and fix that."
