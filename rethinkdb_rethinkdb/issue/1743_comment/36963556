      "FWIW, Gentoo has moved away from having a shared v8 package in tree since it breaks abi way too often. Packages like nodejs, mongodb, chromium and similar bundle their own (upstream, not in tree). It also complicates things like crossdev setups. Its unfortunate but not much to do at the moment."
