      "I'm also against including v8 into the codebase and would strongly prefer @jdoliner's solution. Why don't we do this:\r\n\r\n* Make `r.js` (and therefore v8) optional and turn it off by default in `configure`\r\n* For people that want `r.js` (and for our package builds) use the `--fetch` option\r\n\r\nThis solution will tick all the boxes except @anatol's (using the v8 version available on the target system), but I think that's an acceptable tradeoff (including v8 source into the codebase would also suffer from this disadvantage). I think this is the best route until the v8 API stabilizes."
