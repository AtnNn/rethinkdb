      "I had a short talk with @tryneus and we discussed always using the same version of v8.\r\n\r\n`--fetch v8` would be on by default and it would fetch version 3.21.12 of v8 (The latest version of v8 suported by #1510). All source packages (the tgz and the dsc) would include a copy of the v8 source. I am working on a fix for #1231 that would make the process easier."
