      "Ugg, are there other alternatives here? Including V8 seems like such a pain. Could we maybe make it a submodule, I think we're using those in a few places.\r\n\r\nAlso how would people feel about having a way to compile without V8 (and thus without the `r.js` term). It seems like for people compiling on esoteric platforms it might be nice to have a way to completely take V8 out of the equation."
