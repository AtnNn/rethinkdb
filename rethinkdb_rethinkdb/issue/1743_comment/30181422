      "I'm really opposed to having it in our source tree by default. It's no where near as big a part of our product as it is for those other 3. And it's incredibly annoying to have a huge bloated repository. It is a user facing issue because some users like to build from source and I don't think it's reasonable to just discount the notion of taste because of this.\r\n\r\nI really don't see what the advantages of including the code in our repo are. If we're worried about people not being able to build offline then having a way to compile without javascript solves that problem well. If we're worried about API breaking why don't we just check out the same commit every time with `--fetch`. We shouldn't have to include the whole source tree just to make sure we wind up with the same code every time we compile."
