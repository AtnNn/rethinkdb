      "But you already have \"--fetch v8\" that fetches exact version of v8 (3.19).\r\n\r\nI can use this configure option as well, but I want to be a good Arch maintainer and try to link apps agains system libraries. And Arch follows stable version of V8 (currently it is 3.21).\r\n\r\nI would suggest you to support only 2 versions: 3.19 (default on Ubuntu?) and next V8 version (i.e. currently 3.22) so package mantainers can cherry-pick your commits when this version become stable.\r\n\r\nIt seems not that difficult. Changes are annoying but not very big. But if you think that it is too much for you and you want support '--fetch v8' only I can understand. I will switch to '--fetch' in my package as well."
