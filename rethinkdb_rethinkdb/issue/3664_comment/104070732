      "Since we changed our release plans for 2.1 and 2.2, this is now again something we should do.\r\n\r\nThe minimal solution is to add a message to our 2.1 release notes stating that the protocol buffer protocol is now deprecated and will be removed in the next release. (we should definitely do that)\r\n\r\nThe more polished solution is also printing a log message on the server the first time it detects a protocol buffer client. (we should do that only if we have time left)"
