      "This didn't make it into 2.0.\r\n\r\nI think instead we'll just remove the protocol buffer interface and put a list of now unsupported drivers in the release notes for the next version.\r\n\r\nUsers who rely on old drivers will have to stick with 2.0 for a while, but that's probably ok (the old drivers are unlikely to benefit from most of the new features anyway)."
