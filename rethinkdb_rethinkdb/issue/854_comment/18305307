      "Alright, sorry I didn't get this done yesterday @linuxdynasty. A fix for this is now in the branch \"sindexes_with_bool\" this change breaks the rql tests so someone will need to get those fixed. I observed them acting very strangely and failing with broken pipes so I'm not sure what's going on. After those are fixed we should be able to do a point release for this. @coffeemug and @wmrowan which one of you would like to update the rql_tests to reflect these changes?"
