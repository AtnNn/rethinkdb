        "I don't know how difficult this would be to do so it may not be worth the effort, but when I was working on the polyglot tests it would have been really useful to know the location of the failing test case in the YAML file. Currently you get the index of the failing case like `polyglot/geo/geojson.js/5`, but this isn't that helpful in locating the actual line, especially for the larger files.\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/13319530\n"
