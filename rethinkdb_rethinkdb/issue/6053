        "`backfill_item_t::pair_t` has the following method:\n\n```\n        size_t get_mem_size() const {\n            size_t s = sizeof(pair_t);\n            if (static_cast<bool>(value)) {\n                s += value->size();\n            }\n            return s;\n        }\n```\n\nI think the result of this is sent over the wire to other servers, and we assume on the other end that the values match up with what we compute locally. However, due to the use of `sizeof`, these values are depending on the compiler and architecture.\n\nI can't backfill between a debug-mode Linux and debug-mode Windows build for example, though there might be other issues that contribute to that.\n"
