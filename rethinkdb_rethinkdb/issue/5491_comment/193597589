      "according to discussion #2427, especially this [comment](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2427#issuecomment-140289274), reusing connection can will give roughly twice performance for simple query. Though the connection overhead is not important for complex queries, I think it is not ignorable for relatively simple query used for building REST APIs."
