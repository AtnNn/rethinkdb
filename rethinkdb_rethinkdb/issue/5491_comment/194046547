      "> leaving unfetched data can waste memoey on both server and client.\r\n\r\nThat is true, but only for as long as the cursor that requested the data is still around. If you close the cursor, or it gets garbage collected, the unfetched data is deleted too.\r\n\r\n> reusing connection a connection with unfetched data can corrupt the following result data.\r\n\r\nThis is not currently a concern. The behavior of a query is not influenced by any previous query that was run on the same connection.\r\n\r\nI think in practice you most likely don't need to worry about resetting connections. Though your use case might have some special properties of course that make this important."
