      "> I did not intend to reuse a cursor but a connection.\r\n\r\nI understand. Sorry for causing confusion. The reason I talked about cursors was that cursors are the main thing that affect the state of a connection. A cursor is bound to a connection, and closing all cursors that use a given connection is pretty much equivalent to \"resetting\" the connection.\r\n\r\n> the `cur2` is not affected by `cur1` correct?\r\n\r\nThat is correct. `cur2` will behave the same way regardless of `cur1`.\r\n\r\nAs long as `cur1` is still open and not closed or destructed, the server will keep a bit of bookkeeping information for `cur1` around. In an extreme case with a huge number of open cursors, this could lead to a significant increase in memory consumption on the server.\r\nHowever as long as cursors are closed when they are no longer needed, I don't expect this to become an issue."
