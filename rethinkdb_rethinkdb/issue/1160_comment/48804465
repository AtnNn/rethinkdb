      "> (Also, would you want some kind of downsample operation that takes a sample every u seconds, say,  the first sample after t_0 + k*u for k = 0,1,2,...?)\r\n\r\nThat kinda interesting resample to a seconds (time).  I could see a use for some folks.  Take the once a second temperature of my house and give the temperature every hour.\r\n\r\nWith time series try NOT to think of time in only integer seconds, it can lead to some odd decisions and missed opportunities.  Try to think of them as either a frequency (10 samples per second) or as an integer multiple of a time interval.\r\n\r\nThink of time series as one of two general classes.\r\n- Samples at a fixed sampling rate.\r\n- Samples recorded with a specific time.\r\n\r\nMissing values are an interesting issue, error out or interpolate.  Not sure, it depends on the scenario."
