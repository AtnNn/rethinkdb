      "My signals and systems brain hurts with the term periodic.  I think of it as a generator of data like a periodic signal e.g. sin(x).\r\n\r\nThe python folks call it a step, it could also could be called a stride.\r\n\r\nThis is related to #2664 as these could be considered time series.\r\nAs a you would have these functions. \r\n* .downsample(M)\r\n  * Taking every Mth sample.\r\n* .decimate(M)\r\n  * Taking every Mth sample after digital filtering of all intermediary values.\r\n\r\nArguably you could also add the opposites.\r\n* .oversample(X)\r\n  * Adding X more samples between data points.\r\n  * Typically just pretend that the values are the same as the last value until you get a new real value.\r\n* .interpolate(X)\r\n  * Adding X more samples between data points but with a formula to have gradual change.\r\n  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation\r\n  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whittaker\8211Shannon_interpolation_formula\r\n"
