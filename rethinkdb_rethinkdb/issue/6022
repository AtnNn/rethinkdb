        "There are a number of `check_output` calls in Python files. Unfortunately that was not in Python2.6, which is out lowest target. Previously this was obscured because a number of the tests were running using `/bin/env/python`, which is normally Python2.7 at this point. But I recently switched them to being `py_one` tests, meaning they are now getting run under Python2.6.\r\n\r\nThis is already done, and will go into review tomorrow."
