      "+1 for this feature.\r\n\r\nOur use case is that we want to save I/O on non-SSD nodes. Maximum size and related complications are not a concern, as the table would be basically a view for another table, of which historical data creates a big part (growing, let's say, 100k~500k documents per day), and the \"active\" data is only 10~100k documents.\r\n\r\nTechnically, of course, it's not necessary to have such table in our use case, but it seems easier to write to two tables than to risk having queries get progressively slower as the data grows."
