      "@raarts You could create the table, note the table's UUID (e.g. from `r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_config')`) shut down the server, move the file for that table to the tempfs, create a symlink from the rethinkdb data folder to the table file on tempfs, and restart the server.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this will still work properly though once the table file gets deleted after a restart."
