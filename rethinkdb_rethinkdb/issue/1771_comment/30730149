      "@wojons -- the best way to accomplish this is to create a table with soft durability. This way they'll be absorbed by memory very quickly, written to disk eventually, and the table would act as a cache.\r\n\r\nI think the feature you might actually be looking for is ability to request data only if it's in the cache. That is indeed pretty cool, and it would be awesome to explore this option. I'm moving to backlog for now, we'll come back to it when the time comes."
