      "@coffeemug You have the right i dea I know i can use soft duribilty but from my understanding it wont use more memoery then the table has set for cache or something simular to that. You also dont wanna have to set 6gb of memoery for the table when its going to use 2gb most of the time and the memory is simply used. But yes to have flags for only return data that is in cache is also very useful this way as records get deleted that are in memory the ones on disk come back to memory. The other thing is you may not wanna flush these to disk and use your disk IO for other things. "
