      "I had a proposal for this a while ago: #4576. It basically inverts the idea, rather than having an `.include()` function, it has a `r.fragment` that you can prepend onto your pre-defined part when assigning it to a variable. Then you just put that variable into your query/queries. This of course would all be done client-side, and the server would never know that you had done anything like this."
