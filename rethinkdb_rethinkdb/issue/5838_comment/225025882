      "Interesting.\r\n\r\nSo `include` would be a method on each ReQL AST object and look somewhat like this, right?\r\n```js\r\ninclude(f) {\r\n  return f(this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(plus probably some type checking to make sure `f` still returns a ReQL query.\r\n\r\nIt would allow for custom *infix* query templates, rather than *prefix* templates that are already possible.\r\n\r\nI like this idea. I'm not too happy about the name `include` for this function though. My suggestion would be `.mapQuery(f)`, but there's probably a much better name out there."
