        "Unless I'm missing something, it doesn't seem like you can order the results of a get all using a compound index, or using two separate indexes.\n\nSo for example using an index on 'name' and 'timestamp', it'd be good to be able to do a get all with various 'name' entries, and then order the results after by the second part of the compound index, 'timestamp'. In the alternative, it'd be enough to allow ordering by a separate secondary index different to the index used to get all.\n\nI may well be missing something or an existing issue, any thoughts or comments warmly appreciated!\n"
