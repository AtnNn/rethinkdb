        "I noticed that when I tried to run `rethinkdb export` it said:\r\n\r\n> The rethinkdb-export command depends on the RethinkDB Python driver, which must be installed.\r\n\r\nBecause RethinkDB is \"batteries included\", I think it would be cool if the part of the python driver needed for `rethinkdb export` was pre-packaged. RethinkDB supports many languages, so I think that there are some people (or maybe it's just me) who don't even have `pip` installed because they don't use Python.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with the Python driver **at all**, so if what I said above is impossible because one would need to include the whole Python driver in order to use `rethinkdb export`, then maybe the RethinkDB installer could also try to install the whole Python driver, and if pip isn't already available, it could run [the pip installer](https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py)"
