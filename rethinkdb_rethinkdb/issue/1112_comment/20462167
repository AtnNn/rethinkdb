      "If I'm not mistaken, I think it's more standard to escape quotes by doing a double-double quote inside a field.  I can't look for references at the moment.\n\n/s was taken out in review since it's actually pretty easy to pass that in on a shell (as opposed to tabs).\n\nHeader parsing from a file uses whichever delimiter you specify, but if you use the --custom-header option, field names are separated by commas."
