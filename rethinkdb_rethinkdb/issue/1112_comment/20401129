      "Is this about the import in 1.6 or the new import in 1.7?  The import in 1.7 uses the python csv module with its default settings, which as far as I tested it, supports quoted fields as well as escaped quotes within them.  At the moment there's no option for specifying the delimiter or overriding the header behavior, but we can add those (and they're pretty easy to workaround in the interim)."
