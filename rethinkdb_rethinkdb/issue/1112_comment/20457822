      "Everything sounds good except for a clarification on quotes inside quotes. Some languages such as the Go CSV parser supports something called \"Lazy Quotes\" in which a non-escaped quote can appear inside of a quoted string.\r\n\r\n    \"normal\",\"normal\",\"a simple example using 16\" (inches) to include a quote\"\r\n\r\nThis is usually handled by only counting an end quote as an actual end quote if it is followed by a delimiter character, a new line, or EOF.\r\n\r\nTo explain why I was looking for something like this before I rolled my own is I have many TB of CSV dumps from a legacy system that does not escape inside quotes. If I were to use the import function as it stands now it would require me to do a pre-processing step to fix all of those and by the time I do that I could just, again, import manually."
