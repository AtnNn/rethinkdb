      "Fare enough.\r\n\r\nAnyway, JFYI, I was also working on an automate test framework at part time; it's fair simple now and it works well as expected. After being aware of  this issue, I modified my test script to remove test/sql_test/run unconditionally each time before running a new test. I queued bunches of commit for testing, and it got about 30 results so far, and I see none failed of py-connect.\r\n\r\nAnd just as said, there is no need for being rush to get rid of it from flaky list, I'm okay to wait few more days."
