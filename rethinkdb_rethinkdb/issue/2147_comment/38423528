      "Thanks for identifying the problem. Your fix looks good to me.\r\n\r\nI think the data directories are kept because they can be used to track the cause of a test failure.\r\n\r\nWe have a Jenkins instance in our intranet that runs automated tests. I prefer waiting for them to be green for a few days before unmarking this test as flaky."
