      "For multithreaded clients we normally recommend opening a connection per thread (connections in RethinkDB are really really cheap because of the coroutine engine). That tends to work really well, but if people still insist on making the driver thread-safe, it wouldn't be very hard; we can probably do it in a week or so once it's scheduled."
