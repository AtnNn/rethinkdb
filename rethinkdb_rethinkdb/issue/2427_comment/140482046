      "> I don't think implementing thread safety/connection pooling should be an exercise left up to the reader.\r\n\r\nOh, I definitely agree that an easy to use, canonical, thread-safe connection pool baked into the driver is super-important. We'll try to get that done soon.\r\n\r\n> As far as I can tell it is not well documented that thread safety isn't guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThat's definitely an oversight -- I've opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/897 to address it."
