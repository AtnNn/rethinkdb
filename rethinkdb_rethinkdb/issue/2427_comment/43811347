      "I was under the impression it was clearly stated that our python connection objects are not thread-safe.  This behavior is undefined and somewhat expected when running multiple queries on a connection at the same time from different threads.  I don't know if we already have an open issue about making our connection objects thread-safe, but @larkost makes some good suggestions.  I would be careful about enforcing thread-locality, as some users have certainly built connection pool objects on top of the ReQL driver to pass connections between threads safely."
