      "After talking with @larkost in person, I think this issue should be to make the python connection objects fully thread-safe (that is, we lock and unlock a mutex for the internal socket, and make sure results get to the right reading thread).  The other solutions don't play well with our guarantee that 'you see your own writes' and the case where users have built connection pools on top of the driver.\r\n\r\nThis is basically the same as #2082, but a little more specific (regarding the python driver)."
