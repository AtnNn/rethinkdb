        "Hi,\n\nI have been following RethinkDB for a couple of years and think it's looks very promising. Something that is holding us back a little is that the web UI feels like a big feature, yet it's hard to give access to the UI to one or a group of developers without giving everyone admin privileges.\n\nWith the new user accounts support in 2.3, would it be possible to add the option of authenticating users in the web UI? \n\nI don't have a full development setup for rethinkdb development, but if you change the connection URI here to a normal user: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/admin/static/coffee/app.coffee#L43\n\nWould that work? \n\nTwo give a simple use case example, you run a rethink db instance/cluster that in turn hosts databases with two different apps, developed by different developers or developer teams. In this case I would like as an admin to give team 1 access to their database(s) via the UI and the same for team 2, but I don't want team 1 to be able to run a bad query and delete or change team 2's data. \n\nIs this a feature you agree would be useful or are you against the concept?\n"
