      "The RethinkDB code runs in many separate threads and coroutines. If an exception was accidentally left uncaught, in most cases it would not bubble up to `main`.\r\n\r\nInstead, the C++ RTS would call [`terminate`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/terminate), which RethinkDB handles here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/27180d45218c71f280493f7f1bf4f80c1b5acf96/src/errors.cc#L148\r\n"
