      "OH!  Also, if we have a JSON representation for ReQL:\r\n* ReQL will be homoiconic for the LTS release.  This way we won't have to hide our faces in shame when we go to PL conferences.\r\n* We will be able to store functions (and queries, actually) in tables.  Then we implement `r.eval` and make @mglukhovsky buy us a cake.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
