      "Opened an issue for that: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2225 .  I'll try to get to it soon.\r\n\r\nA brief summary for anyone who wants to get started:\r\n* We still use the protobuf constants, for efficiency.\r\n* We use arrays to represent function calls, the the second argument being the args and the third (optional) being the optargs.\r\n* You use the MAKE_ARRAY function for a literal array.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n```\r\nr.table('test').merge({a: [1,2,3]})\r\n=>\r\n[MERGE,\r\n [TABLE, \"test\"]\r\n {a: [MAKE_ARRAY, [1, 2, 3]]}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to do this right now would probably be to use the Ruby driver to generate protobufs, and put a printf either on the server (in json_shim.cc) or in the driver (in net.rb in `dispatch`) to see what JSON it generates."
