      "Before merging it in next, can we test it on EC2? With different machines for the client/servers? (like in a real environment?).\r\n\r\nWhile we probably use less CPU with JSON, we increase the network traffic, and it would be nice to make sure that we are not just moving the bottleneck in another place.\r\n\r\nOne more thing, the ruby driver was slower than the python/javascript one, and if it was because of the protobuf implementation, the 30% boost may not happen for python/javascript."
