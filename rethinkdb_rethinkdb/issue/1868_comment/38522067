      "I talked with @coffeemug and I want to get this into next after we tag 1.12.  There's work left to do (like making the Python + JS drivers use the new API and re-benchmarking things), but all the improvements are modular and the sooner this is in next the sooner we'll find errors in it.  (Also, divergent branches suck.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is in CR 1369 by @Tryneus ."
