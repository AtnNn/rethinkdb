      "> I did not know that the json api stuff is built into the server already?\r\n\r\nIt's just in the branch `mlucy_json_api`, and it isn't anywhere near done yet.  (It still sends protobuf responses, for example.)  I wouldn't bother coding against the current version, because the API might change.  (It's definitely not making it into 1.12; it's probably going to be in 1.13.)"
