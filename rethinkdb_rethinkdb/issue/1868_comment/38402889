      "So, I've got a functional JSON API with support in the Ruby driver in the `mlucy_json_api` branch.  (Modulo bugs and cleanup, of course, but all the ReQL tests pass at least.  Also, it only compiles in clang right now.)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the previous benchmarking results were premature; I ran better benchmarks once the Ruby driver actually worked, and here's what I got from Daniel's RubyDatabaseBenchmarks script:\r\n\r\n![db_bench](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1777134/2495121/4555d14a-b2e8-11e3-8bc8-911c9f60261d.png)\r\n\r\nThe results are from Newton when nobody was using it today, and the bars are 95% confidence-intervals.  I'm not sure why I was seeing such better performance before (one theory is that the older version of the Ruby driver was serializing times as string rather than pseudotypes, which is fast but incorrect).\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's still something like a 30% speed boost across the board, and I would bet that we can make that better.  (Of course, that will require actually benchmarking things, which might take a little longer.)"
