      "To be honest protobufs made us a bit jaded. It's a well-supported library from Google that's broadly adopted, and it sucks. Before we switch to another library we'd have to test the living hell out of it, which is a lot effort. Alternatively we can just pick json which we know works, is supported everywhere, and is very fast. That seems like a path of least resistance that we know will work.\r\n"
