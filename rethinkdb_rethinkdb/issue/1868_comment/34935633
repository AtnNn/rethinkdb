      "> I think we may also support protobufs for a few versions as a deprecated feature so that people's drivers don't immediately break\r\n\r\nQuestion: are you talking about completely replacing the protobuf API on the server with a JSON API, or are you referring to the Ruby drivers specifically here?"
