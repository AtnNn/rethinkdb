      "Other issues with the polyglot tests:\r\n\r\n* `make js` seems to run the Python tests but not all the JS tests\r\n* ditto `make py`\r\n* I sometimes get an error (which I can't seem to reproduce unfortunately) where the first test can't connect to the server. I think this is because the server is still starting up. Simply increasing the timeout where we wait for the server to start up would fix this. I think it only happens on the first test run after a rebuild. Perhaps it is taking longer to start up the server because the binary is no longer in cache."
