      "Oh hmm maybe I misunderstood you. So if I go to ajax/stats is the topmost level the node, and the perfmons are listed for each node individually?\r\n\r\nI thought the per-machine perfmons were somehow merged together, but it looks like that's not actually the case, is it?\r\nThen I have to take back my comment in #1474 though because then I don't see a reason for why full perfmons should not be turned on or off on a per-machine level (i.e. through a command line parameter)."
