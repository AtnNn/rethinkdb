      "Thanks to @srh's improvements, the performance is ok now.\r\nPoint reads are a bit faster than with the old cache.\r\nSoft durability writes are still slower than before merging the cache, and slower than 1.11 as well (by roughly 20%). We could either try some quick optimizations now, or ship as it is and optimize it later in a point release."
