        "Hello! Today I've encountered a UX problem which almost made me lose an entire DB. The `add/delete` buttons are inverted between table and database, as shown below:\n\n![rethink](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4929965/12755319/386be8d4-c9cf-11e5-8d50-b70dd4aa768d.png)\n\nThis is a very counter intuitive layout. \n\nIf there are more DBs the `Delete selected tables` button will go out of view leaving you at a glance with `Add tables` and `Delete ...` which naturally makes your brain fill in the blank with `Delete tables` when in fact it's `Delete database`.\n\n![rethink 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4929965/12755572/45c133ee-c9d0-11e5-82a7-b8e27a3c5913.png)\n\nCheers.\n"
