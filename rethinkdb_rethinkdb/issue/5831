        "Not quite sure the best way to explain this, but here goes.\n\nWhen I run my rethink nested queries I need to include in my document output the values of items one level below my document root, called `title`. However, to get the required data I need to concatenate some of the nested elements and then perform the query. This means that the top level items don't get returned. \n\nHere's an example of my query:\n\n``` python\nr.db('test').table(\"data\")\\\n    .concat_map(lambda doc: doc[\"items\"]) \\\n    .filter(lambda sa: sa[\"level1\"][\"level2\"] == \"foo\") \\\n    .concat_map(lambda x: x[\"details\"][\"detail1\"])\\\n    .filter(lambda x: x[\"data\"]\n    .match(\"^Hello\")) \\\n    .run()\n```\n\nSo this returns the documents that match `[\"level1\"][\"level2\"]` with a value of `foo` & `[\"details\"][\"detail1\"] [\"data\"] that begins with`Hello`. \n\nHowever, the problem is made somewhat more complex because `items` is an array which means I need to add the `title` to each of the 'items' in order to get what I need to be returned. \n\nSo my question is, how can I include a top level attribute called `title` within my document `items` results. \n\nI think I should be using the `merge` function to restructure my output document, but I'm not completely sure how to build the extra part of the query. \n"
