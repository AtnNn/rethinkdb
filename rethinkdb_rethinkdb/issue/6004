        "A number of tests have been dumped into `test/rql_test`, often with cryptic names and no commenting to explain what they are testing or why. This is not only messy, but a but unworkable to maintain. So before the people who wrote these tests forget why they wrote them we need to:\r\n1. Comment them in meaningful ways, so that others can understand what is being tested and why.\r\n2. Move them into a subfolder that gives them some categorization (the root folder of this wing of testing is not an inappropriate place).\r\n\r\nHere is a list of the tests that qualify currently in `next`:\r\n- [ ] `test/rql_test/em.rb.test`\r\n- [ ] `test/rql_test/em_close.rb.test`\r\n- [ ] `test/rql_test/em_stop.rb.test`\r\n- [ ] `test/rql_test/get_all.rb_one.test`\r\n- [ ] `test/rql_test/get_all_fuzz.rb_one.test`\r\n- [ ] `test/rql_test/stream.py_one.test`\r\n- [ ] `test/rql_test/trivial_cfeed.rb_one.test`\r\n- [ ] `test/rql_test/trunc.rb_one.test`\r\n\r\nSince all of these seem to have been written by @mlucy, I am assigning this to him."
