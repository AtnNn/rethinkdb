      "In order to relocate the missing replicas to different server, you need to reconfigure the table.\r\nAs long as a majority of replicas is still available, you can do this through the web UI or by running `reconfigure` on the table.\r\n\r\nIf a majority of the previous replicas is no longer available, that operation will fail. In that case you need to run\r\n```js\r\nr.db('tsab').table('refreshTokens').reconfigure({emergencyRepair: \"unsafe_rollback\"})\r\n```\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, you'll be able to reconfigure the table normally to bring it back to the desired number of replicas.\r\n\r\nSee http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/reconfigure/ for more details."
