      "Wait, this is fishy. It was by design that the error is thrown on a reconnect. Otherwise how does somebody who uses noreply operations know that the connection had been lost and the operations have not been processed?\r\n\r\nIf a user wants to reconnect no matter whether the connection is open or not, `:noreply_wait => false` can be passed to `reconnect`.\r\nWe should document that reconnect and close can throw an error if the connection is not currently open though."
