        "It seems that things start breaking if you're handling dates before the year 1400.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to provoke this error message is:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.ISO8601(\"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems this limitation is [documented](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/dates-and-times/java/#technical-details), however the error message does not point to this and google isn't very helpful since the error message seems to be a generic error from a library.\r\n\r\nSince it is possible to insert data that contains pre-medieval dates like below, confusion ensues.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"test\").insert({id: 1, date: r.epochTime(-63576576000)})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon this since the .NET RethinkDb.Driver seems to serialize dates differently in different situations. Thus when I insert a new row it uses epochTime, but when I compare the date in a row with a datetime it uses iso8601.\r\n\r\nI suggest the following improvements:\r\n\r\n1. The error message is adjusted to include the above link to technical details\r\n2. Log a warning or raise an error when creating dates outside the limits using epochTime.\r\n3. Fix the limitation."
