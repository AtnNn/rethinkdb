        "There are many inconsistencies in the treatment of strings. It should probably be standardised across drivers and reql functions, and documented.\n\nThe python driver refuses non-ascii strings unless they are unicode:\n\n```\npython> r.expr('\\xc1').run()\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/google/protobuf/internal/type_checkers.py\", line 128, in CheckValue\n    (proposed_value))\nValueError: '\\xc1' has type str, but isn't in 7-bit ASCII encoding. Non-ASCII strings must be converted to unicode objects before being added.\n```\n\nThe ruby driver lets you use strings that are not utf8:\n\n```\nruby> r.expr(\"\\xc1\").run\n=> \"\\301\"\n```\n\nThe python drivers fails badly when receiving a non-utf8 string:\n\n```\nruby> r.table('foo').insert({:a=>\"\\xc1\"}).run\n\npython> r.table('foo').run()\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/google/protobuf/internal/decoder.py\", line 410, in DecodeField\n    field_dict[key] = local_unicode(buffer[pos:new_pos], 'utf-8')\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xc1 in position 0: invalid start byte\n```\n\n`r.js` expects strings to be utf-8, and gets confused when they are not:\n\n```\nruby> r.expr(\"\\xc1\").do(r.js('(function(x){ return x; })')).run\n=> \"\\357\\277\\275\"\n```\n\n`r.match` also expects utf-8:\n\n```\nruby> r.expr(\"a\").match(\".\").run\n=> {\"groups\"=>[], \"end\"=>1, \"str\"=>\"a\", \"start\"=>0}\n\nruby> r.expr(\"\\xc1\").match(\".\").run\n=> nil\n```\n\nOther reql functions that use operations from C++'s `std::string` (such as comparison operators) simply treat strings as arrays of bytes.\n\nThe JSON spec says that\n\n> A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters, wrapped in double quotes\n\nThis affects issues such as #264, #874, #1099 and #1147.\n\nIssue #137 complements this issue by proposing a separate binary data type.\n"
