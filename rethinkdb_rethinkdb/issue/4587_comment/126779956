      "A check before each read to verify that a majority of replicas is available is introduced via the above commit, and as such we'll now refuse non-outdated reads if that's not the case. This means the status no longer incorrectly reports the table to be `\"ready_for_reads\"`, it does however still report the primary to be `\"ready\"`. Changing that is significantly more work, and of less importance thus we should open a new issue in `2.1-polish` for it."
