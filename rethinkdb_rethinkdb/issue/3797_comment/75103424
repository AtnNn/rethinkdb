      "@stuartpb `r.expr` is not a ReQL term, it is a client-side operation that turns a value into a ReQL expression. The server sees no difference between queries with `r.expr` and queries without. For example, these three expressions generate identical ReQL queries: `r.expr(1).add(2)`, `r.expr(1).add(r.expr(2))` and `r.add(1,2)`.\r\n\r\nHowever `r.literal` is a ReQL term that is sent to the server and used by `merge`."
