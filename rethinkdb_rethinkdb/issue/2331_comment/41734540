      "Right now i am using Tinc vpn. So the decode in code is done in the cpu. It use linux tun/tap so i am not sure if eth0 is responding back the packet matches the checksum or if tun0 is responding it matches if its tun0 then it could just be the max sped of 1 cpu core or something like that but since the node has lots of cores it can have lots of connections going at any given time. These nodes are super close in the same data center they may be on the same rack they are from same provider. "
