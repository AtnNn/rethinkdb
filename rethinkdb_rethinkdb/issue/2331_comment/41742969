      "Using multiple connections would be relatively easy, because mailboxes already don't have any ordering guarantees. So we can send mailbox messages round robin over a bunch of connections.\r\n\r\nWe would probably still use only a single connection for all non-mailbox communication (such as heartbeats and directory updates)."
