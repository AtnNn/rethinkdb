      "It turns out that the test was just totally broken in multiple ways, and one of the problems was a race condition that caused the test to pass without actually testing what it was supposed to test. In the unlikely event that the race condition went the other way, the `groups->size()` error would show up due to a different problem.\r\n\r\nFix is in CR 2952."
