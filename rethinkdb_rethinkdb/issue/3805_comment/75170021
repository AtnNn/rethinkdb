      "Thanks for reporting @anatol !\r\n\r\nLooking at the test it seems like the test itself can be timing dependent. Basically it tries 5 times to verify that the results of a certain operations are what they should be (waiting for a background operation to complete), waiting 100ms between each try.\r\n\r\n@anatol for finding out if that's the problem, could you go to the file `src/unittest/rdb_btree.cc` and change a line as follows:\r\nFrom:\r\n```\r\n#define MAX_RETRIES_FOR_SINDEX_POSTCONSTRUCT 5\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\n#define MAX_RETRIES_FOR_SINDEX_POSTCONSTRUCT 20\r\n```\r\n\r\nand rerun the unit tests?"
