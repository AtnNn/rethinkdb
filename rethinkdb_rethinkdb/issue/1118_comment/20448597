      "Like, a single incremental job could only operate on data from a single table?  Or that each database could only have one table on which incremental jobs could be registered?\r\n\r\nFor the use case I had in mind when I asked the HN question that I think prompted this ticket, the former would be acceptable, but the latter wouldn't.  I have no idea what other uses people have in mind, though."
