      "> I'm not sure we want to drop new_val/old_val for single document change feeds or aggregation changefeeds (though I see why that's cleaner).\r\n\r\nYou could do this by replacing `r.table('test').get(1).changes()` with `r.table('test').between(1, 1, right_bound: 'closed').changes()`.\r\n\r\nWe could also provide an optarg to change the format.\r\n\r\nHow important do you think this is?  I feel like in most cases you don't want the `old_val`/`new_val` format for single-row selections, so maybe we should make it possible if you need it but not the default."
