      "@mlucy -- a few additional questions about the spec.\r\n\r\nThe point changefeeds will merge unread events (which is great), but can we extend this to range changefeeds too? For example, if I have a feed on a table, and there are multiple things happening to a particular document before I had the opportunity to read it, should/could we merge those events? (when a user reads, I think `old_val` should be set to the first old values, and `new_val` should be set to the last new value).\r\n\r\nAlso, how hard would it be to amend the spec with a `merge` optarg (defaulting to true). If `merge` is true, we merge events as specified. If it's false, we report each event. If it's set to an integer value (in milliseconds), we merge events, but only within that window. I think it would be a really useful feature and would make for a much stronger announcement, but I don't want to amend the spec last minute if this is hard to implement. (Also, `merge` may not be the best of names)"
