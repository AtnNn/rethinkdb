      "@apendleton the former was what I meant. To give people an idea of how much easier it is I think I could probably do the one table case in less than a month while the general case would probably as many as 4-5 months all told. I think it's a feature about on the same scale as secondary indexes which took about that long.\r\n\r\nI actually think we should ship the one table case sometime semi soon (I think post 2.0 probably), gauge people's response to it and then expand from there. Also if we had triggers then the one table limitation really wouldn't be that bad because you could write triggers to push data from where you wanted it in to your single table where it would get map reduced. We'd add some sugar on top of that it and could actually be really nice. On top of that a lot of the features for managing tables you actually want for this incremental map reduce stuff as well. Redundancy will make the computed value more available. Sharding can help it scale better."
