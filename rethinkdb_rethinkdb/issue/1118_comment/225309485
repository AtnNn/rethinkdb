      "@meenie You might be able to rewrite the grouping into a reduction, in which case it would work. You would basically maintain an object `{group1: group1Value, group2: group2Value, ...}` in the reduction. This might become inefficient if there are a lot of groups, because a new object will be constructed every time the reduction function is called."
