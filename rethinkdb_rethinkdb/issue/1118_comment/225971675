      "@danielmewes -- leaving 2 and 3 for later sounds good to me.  I don't think 2's representation would be a particularly involved discussion, though -- I was imagining we'd just emit the entire grouped data every time it changed (so `{old_val: {grp: red, grp2: red2}, new_val: {grp: red}}`).  If we wanted to support plain old `.group.changes` that would require thinking a little about the format, though.\r\n\r\nOn `coerce_to`, I think `coerce_to('array')` and `coerce_to('object')` are the only ones that can take a stream."
