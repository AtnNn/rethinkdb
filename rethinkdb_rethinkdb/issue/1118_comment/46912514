      "I think that's ok. We wouldn't market this feature as incremental map/reduce -- we'd market it as instantaneous updates to the result of a query (well, not quite like this, we'd have to find better wording, but you get the idea). Essentially, you pay the price of running a query, and then get any updates in realtime. We'll phrase it in such a way as to not confuse people, and not have them expect things that aren't quite true yet.\r\n\r\nWe can then deal with large tables in #2587."
