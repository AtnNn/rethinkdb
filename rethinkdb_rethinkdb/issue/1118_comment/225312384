      "> r.table('test').filter(...).reduce{|a,b| ...}.changes(reverse: lambda {|acc, o| ...})\r\nr.table('test').filter(...).reduce(reverse: lambda {|acc, o| ...}){|a,b| ...}\r\n\r\nSince the reverse function is only needed because it's a changefeed, it seems like the first one makes sense. But then again it's not clear which function it's reversing if they're separated. I guess it feels kind of wrong to me to require something extra when you're doing `.changes` vs. a normal query.\r\n\r\n(to clarify, I know why we have to do it in this case, but it pulls me towards option 1 over option 2)"
