      "After talking with Slava, I think we should try having single selections and aggregations return a stream of plain objects rather than `old_val`/`new_val` pairs.  If it turns out to be confusing, we can switch.\r\n\r\nI also think we should definitely have an optarg to return the initial value in those cases.  I'd like to propose we call it `return_first`, `return_initial`, or `return_current`."
