      "For the moment, I'm shooting for something very different with this feature. The spec above would give people the ability to get instantaneous updates to values of many different types of queries. They wouldn't persist on restart (or even on disconnect), but for a variety of reasons, I think that's sufficient for v1. It would require a bunch of infrastructure work, and would leave the door open to later include persistent incremental map/reduce support (where the user would save the query), but I think we should do that separately in future releases. I've opened #2587 to track that."
