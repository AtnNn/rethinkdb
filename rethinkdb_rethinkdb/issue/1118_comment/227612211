      "Marking settled as:\r\n\r\n* You can write any of these:\r\n  - stream.avg(...).changes()\r\n  - stream.sum(...).changes()\r\n  - stream.count(...).changes()\r\n  - stream.reduce(..., reverse: FUNC).changes()\r\n  - stream.coerceTo('array').changes()\r\n  - stream.coerceTo('object').changes()\r\n* In particular, it doesn't need to be on a selection;\r\n  `.map.reduce.changes` etc. are legal.  (We should probably support\r\n  `concat_map.reduce.changes` even though we don't yet support\r\n  `.concat_map.changes`, since it's easy.)\r\n\r\nFor 2.4 we will implement the slower variant that performs the initial reduction on the parsing node rather than distributing it."
