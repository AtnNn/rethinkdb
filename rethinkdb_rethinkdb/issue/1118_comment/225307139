      "> so at 2.4 , we can do counts on changefeed? that will be awesome!\r\n\r\nYes, that's the idea :)\r\nThe initial count will run a bit slower in a changefeed for 2.4 compared to running just the `count` without `changes`. But we can optimize this in the future to get almost the same performance."
