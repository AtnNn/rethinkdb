      "> wrt to where to specify the reverse function, we should consider #1725. For example, if we specify it in changes, how would that work with multiple aggregations? Also, we'll not only need to specify it in the changes command, but also when we persist queries. It seems to me like it's way better to specify it in the reduce command for all these reasons.\r\n\r\nAlright, you've sold me.  We'll make it an optarg on `reduce`."
