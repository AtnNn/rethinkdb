      "Hmm, I have to think about it. It might be sufficient for most real use cases, but at first glance this makes me feel really uneasy. One thing MongoDB does that people find extremely annoying is introduce features that don't work with other features of the database. For example, they have plenty of collection types that cannot be sharded, which makes the user experience really frustrating since it moves the burden from developers to users. People can't just use the features they want and have the confidence that they will work.\r\n\r\n(I don't think it necessarily means we should restrict functionality, just that this tradeoff comes with connotations frustrating for users, so we should think carefully before we choose to do it this way)"
