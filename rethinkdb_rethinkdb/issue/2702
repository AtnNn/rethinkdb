      Just
        "`change_tracking_map_t` assumes that listeners will be notified after every new version. But `cross_thread_watchable_t` isn't guaranteed to deliver every version to its listeners; if several changes happen in quick succession, it may only deliver the latest version. This can result in the listener on the other end of the cross_thread_watchable_t silently missing some changes.\r\n\r\nThere are two possible solutions to this. The quickest fix is to make `cross_thread_watchable_t` guaranteed to deliver every version. The other option is to replace `change_tracking_map_t` with something that doesn't make assumptions about `watchable_t` behavior.\r\n\r\nIf we keep `change_tracking_map_t`, we should document that `watchable_t` is required to deliver every version. Also, `run_until_satisfied()` will sometimes not examine every version; we should check if anything is using `run_until_satisfied()` on a `change_tracking_map_t`, and document that they mustn't be used together.\r\n\r\nPing @danielmewes, @srh."
