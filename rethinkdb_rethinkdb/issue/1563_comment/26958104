      "@wojons We only allow so much of the cache to be dirty (contain changes that haven't been committed to disk). Given your numbers I think there's a good chance you're hitting that. It's probably a bad idea to mess with this value because if users have too much dirty data in the cache then their write throughput can completely stall out when the cache is filled with dirty blocks.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you give it more cache space?"
