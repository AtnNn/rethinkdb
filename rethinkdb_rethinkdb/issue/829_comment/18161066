      "@neumino I agree with you that an bloated complete functionally UI is worse than a clean one. But somehow I'm convinced that we could figure out a way to add a Using default database: <dropdown> thus making writing queries shorter and cleaner. I don't think using this dropdown would bring up the questions about the cost of switching databases, etc.\r\n\r\nIf we decide not to support this, then I agree that r.table() is almost useless to end users and thus we shouldn't have it."
