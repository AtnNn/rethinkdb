      "The reason why it didn't complete before was because `r.tableCreate()`, `r.tableDrop()` were not defined (See #46).\r\n\r\nNow that they are defined, fixing this issue is a one line change in `header.json`, but I'm strongly opposed to give to the users `r.table()` for the following reasons.\r\n\r\n1. Only us (developers trying stuff in the data explorer) regularly use r.table()\r\n2. It's one more thing to explain to first time user that there is a default database (see HN thread when we published the \"try it in your browser\"\r\n3. We don't have a usual definition of database. People always ask about what is the cost of switching database.\r\n4. We don't let users tweak the connection on the data explorer, and we shouldn't add a drop-down list of databases -- We already have too many things (with history/options)\r\n5. It's ok not to provide the whole API. We already don't let people use `.run()` in the data explorer.\r\n6. People are going to try stuff like r.table('db_name.table_name') and are going to be frustrated\r\n\r\nI'm open to discuss about that, but I'm strongly opposed to it mainly because it would make the experience of first time users more difficult.\r\n"
