      "Sure no problem. After thinking about it, it's a useful feature to debug queries written in random places.\r\n\r\nCan we add the syntax `r.table(\"db.table\")`? I'm still concern with first time users starting with `r.table(..)` then being kind of stuck .They will still be able to pick a database from a drop down menu, but still, it seems like a wrong flow of action to me.\r\n\r\nThat would also justify the fact that `.` is forbidden in db/table names."
