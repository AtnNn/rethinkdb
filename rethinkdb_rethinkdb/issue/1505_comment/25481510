      "I'm a little concerned about what a high reaching feature like this will do for the minimum system requirements needed to run rethinkdb.  I think I would prefer this to be some sort of  feature flip or extension rather than fully baked into the core.\r\n\r\nOr was I just reading too far into the implementation and if the  hl3.exe/app external dependencies are not met, then  it just returns false?"
