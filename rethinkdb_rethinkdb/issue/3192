We could also add mime term for getting and setting the mime-type manually, like:\n\n``` javascript\nsome_binary.mime()\nsome_binary.mime('image/png')\n```\n\nBasically, I ran into this trying to use binaries in earnest today. I ended up needing to always store the mime-type alongside. It'd be nice to have rethinkDB handle that automatically.\n"
