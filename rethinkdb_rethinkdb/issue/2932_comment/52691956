      "In the second option, what happens if a server goes down? To me, a server being up or down feels like part of the cluster's state. But when the server comes back up, under the above proposal, it would automatically resume its old job. So it feels like `go_to_state()` isn't actually just changing the state of the cluster. It's also configuring an automatic mechanism to keep the cluster in that state. The server's behavior of automatically resuming its old job after starting up feels like it belongs in the same conceptual category as auto-failover."
