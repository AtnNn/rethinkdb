      "What happens when a server falls over? Since there is no count of the number of masters/replicas needed does the system not automatically add a replacement? I like that the user has the option of manually assigning servers roles on tables, and that `table.reconfigure()` allows for automatic selection. Could these two maybe be combined? That is you call `table.reconfigure()` with two of servers that you want to be masters, but tell it you want three masters, so one is automatically chosen to go along with the two you specified."
