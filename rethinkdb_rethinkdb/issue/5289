        "We're working with Kyle Kingsbury on putting RethinkDB through the Jepsen tests. The first chunk of the analysis was published on January 4th (https://aphyr.com/posts/329-jepsen-rethinkdb-2-1-5) and RethinkDB passed the tests with flying colors. We're now working with Kyle to do even more sophisticated analysis -- testing read/write guarantees during cluster reconfiguration.\n\nKyle found a potential guarantee failure -- acknowledged writes that happened during rapid cluster reconfiguration may be lost in the reconfiguration process. We'll be publishing more details as we get more information, but here's what we know so far: if you do rapid reconfigurations of the RethinkDB cluster, in about one out of a few thousand reconfigurations some of the writes that occurred during reconfiguration may be lost. This is unlikely to happen in production since the tests are creating thousands of random configurations that potentially overlap with each other, but there are some steps you can take to eliminate the impact of this bug.\n\n_Edit: Please follow the updated workaround from https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5289#issuecomment-175394540 instead_\n**Workaround:** don't reconfigure a live cluster; if you need to make a change to the cluster configuration, shut down all RethinkDB clients first and don't reconfigure during live writes.\n\nSorry for the inconvenience everyone, we're working around the clock to get more information and get this fixed.\n"
