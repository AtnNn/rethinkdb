      "You typically can't import secondary indexes into an earlier version of RethinkDB than the version used to create the indexes, so failing to import from 2.1.5 to 2.0.5 is no surprise.  Failing from 2.1.5 to 2.2.1 is a problem, though.  I can try to reproduce it myself, but it would be helpful to see the corresponding info file for the table (probably `geo.info` given the filename in the error message)."
