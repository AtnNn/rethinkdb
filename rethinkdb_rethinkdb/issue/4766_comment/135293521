      "I did some testing and found that importing a v1.13 secondary index would cause a `fail_due_to_user_error`, which means a query could crash the server.  I've uploaded a fix in review 3190 to make this situation result in a ReqlRuntimeError.\r\n\r\nThe original problem in this issue is likely caused by the incomplete secondary index version handling in v2.1.0, wherein we would correctly handle outdated `cluster_version_t`s, but not `reql_version_t`s.  This has been fixed in v2.1.1 and up."
