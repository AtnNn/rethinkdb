      "So now if the tooltip annoy you, you can just hit `ESC` and the tooltip will disappear.\r\nThe suggestions will still be displayed again as soon as you hit a key.\r\n\r\nSo the use case is just:\r\n- The user is writing a long query\r\n- The user needs to know what's behind the tooltip\r\n- The user hit ESC\r\n- The user read what he needed\r\n- The user get back writing his query and getting suggestions\r\n\r\n@coffeemug is that enough for this issue or do you want to add a permanent way to hide/show suggestions?"
