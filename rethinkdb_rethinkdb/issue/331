        "The data explorer currently has odd behavior when it comes to indenting code when the user presses 'enter' on long queries. (I don't have an example of this handy, but multiple people observed it in different circumstances). It also doesn't do automatic brace pairing (e.g. if I type `(`, good editors will complete it with `)` and put my cursor in the middle -- similarly for `{}` and `[]`).\r\n\r\nThe solution to this problem is probably to replace CodeMirror with a better editor (like ACE, Brackets -- which should be easy because it's actually built on top of CodeMirror, or perhaps another one -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript-based_source_code_editors)."
