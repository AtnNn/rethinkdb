      "Hi @danielcompton , there used to be a tool to accomplish this based on the Python driver, https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdb-driver-development . It's not up to date, but I suspect it would be pretty easy to update to the latest upstream Python driver.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the Data Explorer is the right place for this functionality, as it would add additional UI clutter (even if we just make it an option in the settings) for a feature that few users need.\r\n\r\n@deontologician do you have any thoughts on this?"
