      "I think a tool like that one is useful (especially in light of the minimal documentation we have now for writing drivers), but I agree it's special purpose enough that it wouldn't be good in the webui. Generally, we'd only put things there that we expect a large number of users to get a benefit from, and this will only benefit driver writers.\r\n\r\nI opened issue #4812 to add protocol logging to the python driver, I think that would probably handle this need, and would be easy to maintain"
