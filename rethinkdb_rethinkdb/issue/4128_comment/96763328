      "Hi @digi604, this is by design because we want the result of a write operation to remain in the same format if you insert or change multiple documents at once.\r\nIf we threw an exception, the results of the other operations would get lost.\r\n\r\nThat being said, we have been considering adding an alternative mode that throws on the first error: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3440 . Please feel free to chime in over there."
