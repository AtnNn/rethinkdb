The cluster auth key should only be used when you're opening a connection to the database (e.g. `r.connect()`)\r\n\r\nCan you include the script you're using, and the output of `r.db('rethinkdb').table('cluster_config')`?\r\n What happens when you try to connect via a REPL like `python` or `bpython`?\r\n```python\r\n>>> import rethinkdb as r\r\n>>> r.connect(auth_key='hunter22')\r\n```"
