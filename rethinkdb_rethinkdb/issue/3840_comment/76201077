      "@mjhea0, the `admin` command has been replaced by a set of system tables used for cluster administration. To set an auth key, run the following query from any of the client drivers, or directly from the Data Explorer:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.db('rethinkdb').table('cluster_config').get('auth').update({auth_key: 'newkey'})\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information on setting auth keys, check out the section titled 'Securing the driver port' of this document: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/security/\r\n\r\nHope that helps!"
