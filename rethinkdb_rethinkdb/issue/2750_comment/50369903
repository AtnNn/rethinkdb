      "So I reinstalled rethinkdb, it picked up the old data but I reimported anyway.\r\nTable audience is 1 shard, 1 replica, 1 primary, and ~852247 documents.\r\n\r\n`r.table(\"audience\").indexList()` reports 2 indexes: ` [\"browser\",\"browser_version\"] `\r\n\r\n`r.table(\"audience\").group({index: \"browser\"}).count()`  takes around 3.8 secs, here's the profile: http://pastebin.com/pMqAFBXN\r\n\r\nLast time I sharded the table onto the 4-node cluster and performance was worse. I want to run more tests before trying that route (which is actually our use case).\r\n\r\n"
