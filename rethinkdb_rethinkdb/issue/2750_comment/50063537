      "@mping -- thanks for reporting the issue and sorry you ran into this. Could you give us a little more information:\r\n\r\n- Which OS you're running on\r\n- Some hardware information (most importantly -- do you have SSDs or rotational disk? How much memory is available on the machine? How many CPU cores?)\r\n- A representative document from the table (you can sanitize the information of course)\r\n- The command you used to create the index\r\n- The query you're running\r\n\r\nWe'd love to try and reproduce this internally, but need a bit more info to make that happen."
