      "@danielmewes: we need to load *something* off of disk for `table.group(index: ...).count` because we need to know what the group is.  I'm not sure how we currently store secondary index values -- do we store them separately, or do we just re-compute them from the main data with the secondary index function?  If the former, we could optimize it to just load the secondary index values; if the latter, we couldn't."
