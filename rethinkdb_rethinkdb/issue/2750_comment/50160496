      "Ok, here's what I got:\r\n* Debian GNU/Linux 7.5 (wheezy)\r\n* Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 @ 2.30GHz\r\n* 32Gb RAM, around ~28Gb free\r\n* rotational disks (SCSI)\r\n* command to start is `rethinkdb --join meo-loucos01.meoapps.bk.sapo.pt --bind all` (manual start)\r\n* I created the index after inserting docs, with the command `table.indexCreate(\"os\") ` straight in the web client. Can't exactly remember the field but the cardinality was low (probably under 100 distinct cols fo the index). The field was not longer than the site guid for sure (38 chars).\r\n* the query was something like `r.table('audience').group('os').count()`\r\n* Im using the debian package so I would have to build from src in order to use 1.13.3, it seems that it is not yet available\r\n\r\nsample doc - note theres not nested fields:\r\n```\r\n{\"browser_version\":\"IE 8.0\",\"os\":\"Windows\",\"visitor_type\":\"new\",\"screen_resolution\":\"1676x943\",\"device_type\":\"pc\",\"site_guid\":\"55555dss-4444-4e22-333f-22cbdc22d2f6\",\"browser\":\"IE\",\"hostname\":\"my.custom.host\",\"page_scope\":\"single_page\",\"city\":\"Porto\",\"country\":\"Portugal\",\"os_version\":\"Windows 7\",\"visitors_register_10\":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1048576,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\"visits_duration\":\"0\",\"visitors\":\"1\",\"pageviews\":\"1\",\"visits\":\"1\",\"ts\":\"1404172800000\"}\r\n\r\n```\r\n"
