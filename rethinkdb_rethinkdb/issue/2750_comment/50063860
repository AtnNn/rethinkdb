      "Hi @mping. Thank you for opening an issue report.\r\n\r\nCan you give us the exact groupBy query you were performing?\r\n\r\nWhat is the rough approximate size of your documents? Do they contain deeply nested arrays or sub-objects?\r\n\r\nFinally: What is the approximate size of the field that you are indexing over? When the indexed field gets over a certain length and many keys have a common prefix, they become inefficient in RethinkDB (I opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/430 to add documentation for those limitations)."
