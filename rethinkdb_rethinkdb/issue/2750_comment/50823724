      "@mlucy: I think you are right that we currently always load the document to check the secondary index value. We could be smarter about that though in cases where the secondary index value has not been truncated in the key. In that case we could reconstruct the secondary index value from the key without loading the document data.\r\nIt would stop working when secondary index values become too large of course.\r\n\r\n@mping There will likely be a slight improvement here when the change described in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1915#issuecomment-50716270 ships. It will avoid having to parse the array-valued `visitors_register_10` field when doing the `count()` query on the documents. However I wouldn't expect the improvement to be super dramatic, since that's only part of your documents (judging from the example you provided)."
