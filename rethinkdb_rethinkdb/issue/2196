        "Reported via https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rethinkdb/85Is3K3bHUw. I'd like to open a GitHub issue to track it, because performance feels odd, and we should investigate when we have some time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have a table with about 80'000 documents. When I do a query in the data explorer:\r\n\r\nr.db(\"mydb\").table(\"products\").filter(r.row(\"name\").match(\"carbonara\")).limit(10)\r\n\r\nit takes about 15 seconds. I think that is a bit to slow for a web application.\r\n\r\nThe server has the follwoing specs:\r\nIntel(R) Atom(TM) CPU D525   @ 1.80GHz (4Cores)\r\n4GB Memory\r\n\r\nIs my CPU to slow for this type of queries?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI asked the user to get back to us with the following questions:\r\n\r\nWould you mind pasting the results of the following queries for me:\r\n- r.db(\"mydb\").table(\"products\").count()\r\n- r.db(\"mydb\").table(\"products\").filter(r.row(\"name\").match(\"carbonara\")).count()\r\n\r\nAlso, a few more questions:\r\n- What does a typical document in the table look like? How big is it, etc.\r\n- What version of RethinkDB are you using? (you can find out by typing `rethinkdb --version`)\r\n- What is the performance of the query if you run it more than once without restarting the RethinkDB server?\r\n"
