      "Yes, Raft conversion would make this obsolete.\r\n\r\nI mentioned this because @coffeemug at one point considered this feature very important and wanted me to think of a way to squeeze it into the release. That ended up turning into the Raft conversion project, which was obviously too big for the release. But this is a quicker \"band-aid\" fix that might be feasible before the release.\r\n\r\nOn further thought, I'm opposed to implementing this; it's likely to break things and it could easily get out of hand. So I think we shouldn't do this unless @coffeemug thinks it's really, really important and worth the cost."
