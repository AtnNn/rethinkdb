        "If I do: \r\n\r\nr.db('test').table('table3').update({description: r.row(\"value1\") + \" \" + r.row(\"value2\")})\r\n\r\nis it the intended result really the following: \r\n\r\n{\r\n\"description\":  \"r.row(\"value1\") r.row(\"value2\")\" ,\r\n\"name\":  \"137576da-500e-4c36-8ca7-e614d02b1e79\" ,\r\n\"value1\":  \"foo\" ,\r\n\"value2\":  \"bar\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nOn a side note, the api docs currently have these items for String manipulation (where I think people intuitively look to, when trying to do things to strings):\r\n\r\nmatch\r\nsplit\r\nupcase\r\ndowncase\r\n\r\nIf people need to concatenate strings, they need to figure out that the information they need, can be found under the \"Math and logic\" section, and add() is the way to go. How to resolve this without repeating the functions under many sections, I don't know. Current state might be good enough, just wanted to point it out because this came up when I was answering to a question at #rethinkdb  \r\n\r\nedit:\r\nalso at http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/add/  under the section that describes how to concatenate strings, it might be helpful to point out, that you don't need to do: \r\nr.row('field1').add(\" \").add(r.row('field2')) , \r\nyou can do: \r\nr.row('field1').add(\" \", r.row('field2') )\r\n\r\nCurrently there is an example with array of strings, but at least to me it wasn't immediately clear that you can have multiple comma separated strings inside add() to concatenate them. This might be problem only for us n00bs and I suspect the pro's wouldn't even need to think about it."
