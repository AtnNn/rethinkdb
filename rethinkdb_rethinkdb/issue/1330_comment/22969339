      "It will still be possible to join multiple machines with the admin CLI, it just wouldn't be required to be connected to all machines for operations that update blueprints.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think we should port a lot of the admin CLI's functions to the query language, since it is already possible to create and drop dbs and tables, there's not much worse you can do with the CLI.  I think it should be integrated as a part of reql, though, not some passthrough to the CLI."
