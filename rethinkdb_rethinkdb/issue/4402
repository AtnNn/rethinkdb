I changed line 434 to\r\n```\r\nself.close(noreply_wait=False, token=res_token)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand that particular error went away. \r\n\r\nI cannot figure out what is causing the \"Unexpected response received\". It only happens when my application is loaded in it's entirety (it's a django app). \r\n\r\nIf I send the problematic HTTP requests separately (using firebug, etc) it works fine.\r\n\r\nThe error does not happen on the same query every time either. They are all simple queries also.\r\n\r\nThe rethinkdb server prints no error messages, I can't figure out how to track this down.\r\n\r\nI am using rethinkdb 2.0.3 and the python drivers 2.0.0-post2 with python3.\r\n\r\nWith pip there's also a conflict of some sort with versions:\r\n```\r\nrethinkdb                     - This package provides the Python driver library for the RethinkDB database server.\r\n  INSTALLED: 2.0.0.post2\r\n  LATEST:    2.0.0-2\r\n\r\n```\r\n"
