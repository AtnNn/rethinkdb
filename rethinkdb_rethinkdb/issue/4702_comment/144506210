      "@larkost Python 2.7.6 on Linux fredrik 3.16.0-50-generic #66~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Sep 10 17:05:00 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux.\r\n\r\nI removed the full path that's the reason for the $PATH in the error message.\r\n\r\n@sontek Yes, I did have a local file named ```rethinkdb.py``` in my local directory. I renamed the file, uninstalled the driver and reinstalled the driver again.\r\n\r\nThe error message from the ```pip install rethinkdb``` persists. However the Python script now executes as expected. So this resolved my issue, thanks!"
