      "If we can make sure `pip` can pick the right package automatically, option 2 would be a good solution I think.\r\n\r\nI don't particularly like the idea of having a separate `rethinkdb3.4` driver that one has to explicitly select. At the moment few people might be using Python 3.4, but it wouldn't work well in the long term."
