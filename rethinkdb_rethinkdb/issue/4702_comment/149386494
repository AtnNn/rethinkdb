      "This is now up for review with CR 3286 from branch `larkost/4702-hide-net_asyncio.py`.\r\n\r\nMy solution actually winds up being the best-of-all-worlds: we only upload a single version to `pypi`, but `pip`/`easy_install` wind up installing only the parts of the driver that are relevant for the version of Python it is being installed for. I have put the specialized `net.py` subclasses inter own sub-modules, and play with the `packages` setting we are sending to `setuptools.setup` to only include the relevant ones."
