      "The error should not be getting in the way of installing or using the `rethinkdb` Python driver, and I have just manually verified that `sudo pip install rethinkdb` works for both Python2.7 and Python3.4 (so presumably 2.6-3.4).\r\n\r\n@westermarck my guess is that there is something else going on here. Can you tell me what version of Python and what OS you are on? Also, are you doing something specific to get `$PATH/rethinkdb.py` in there? Unless you edited the error message that looks suspicious to me."
