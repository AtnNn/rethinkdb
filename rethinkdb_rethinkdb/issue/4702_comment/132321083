      "@larkost My two cents: Having two versions is probably the best solution. I have never met anyone who actually uses Python 3.4, yet. The vast majority of folks appears to use 2.7 at the moment. Those who do use Python 3.4 (like myself) are usually aware of compatibility issues and would not be surprised if there is a separate \"rethinkdb3.4\" driver."
