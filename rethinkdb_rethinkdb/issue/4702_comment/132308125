      "A bit of research this morning and the looks like it id going to be really annoying to solve. Unless some questions I asked of others comes back with a better solution it looks like our avenues are:\r\n1. Live with the warning. I have to confirm that all of the other files are getting compiled fine, but we are probably good.\r\n2. Submit 2 versions of the driver to PyPi for every release, one that is marked for Python3.4 and above (i.e.: for every major new version) and includes all files, and the other marked for Python2.6-Python3.3 that excludes this one file. This is going to cause some confusion as I am not sure that `pip` will automatically handle this for us, and I also think that we would have to go into the admin interface every time we release to re-enable the other \"older\" release.\r\n3. Use a script to manipulate this file while installing. This feels like a bad idea, but would probably work."
