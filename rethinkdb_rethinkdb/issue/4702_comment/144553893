      "To reiterate what I [said above](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4702#issuecomment-131908271), the message printed during `pip install rethinkdb` should be considered a warning only.\r\n\r\nI do absolutely want to remove it, but it is unimportant since that particular file is not usable unless you are on Python3.4, and in that case it would not generate an error. There are a few ideas for suppressing the error, but I have to do some testing to see which one would work. This has taken a back-seat to other issues."
