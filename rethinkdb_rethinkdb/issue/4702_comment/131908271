      "This is very likely `pip` running `compile` on all of the files (very good thing), but we do have one file that is only really valid for Python3.4 (and above) since it uses `asyncio`. We do the right things at runtime so that this is not generally a problem outside of the `compile` phase. But we should attempt to somehow avoid this warning during install."
