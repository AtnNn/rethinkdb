      "I think this is just backfills starving out the heartbeat.  Everytime anything is read from a `keepalive_tcp_conn_stream_t` (used by intra-cluster connections), it should refresh the heartbeat, so my only theory is that there is a chunk of a message that is large enough that it takes 10 seconds or more to read.\r\n\r\nI suppose for larger reads, we could just do it in small incremental chunks, although the optimal value will really depend on the throughput of the connection.  If we did it in 10k chunks, that would mean a connection would have to have approximately 1k/s throughput or less if it is dropped in this manner."
