      "I've got a fix for this up in review 746.  Incidentally, this appears to increase performance in my stress tests by about 10-20%, as well as lower cpu usage.  I imagine this is because `connectivity_cluster_t::run_t::handle(...)` now has much lower latency for intra-cluster message handling, especially when under load.  Granted, this performance increase shouldn't apply to all scenarios, but it is significant."
