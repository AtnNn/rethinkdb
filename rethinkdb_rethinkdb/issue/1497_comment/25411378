      "While the code is bad, this bug does not result in bad behavior or real unreliable behavior in practice, because the perfmon_collection_t is part of an internal_disk_backed_queue_t that is still in the process of being destructed -- so its memory is sitting around unused, and its destructors don't do anything interesting.\r\n\r\nI'm moving this issue to 1.11."
