      "This is likely happening because the data explorer sets the timeout to five minutes. If you run the query from a language interpreter, things might work better for you.\r\n\r\nAs far as the cache size, RethinkDB takes some portion of free RAM, and your `free` printout says there is 235M of free RAM. You can set the cache size manually (in MB) by passing `--cache-size` on the command line (or setting it in the config file). Could you try that?\r\n\r\nI added the following issues to minimize this problem:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2316 -- making connection timeout in data explorer configurable\r\n- https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2317 -- improving the error message\r\n\r\nPlease keep track of progress in those issues -- closing this one. Please reopen if there is more to discuss, and feel free to post more questions. Sorry you ran into this!"
