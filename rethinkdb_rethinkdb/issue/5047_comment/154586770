      "It's legal to call `between` with a lower bound >= than the upper bound, and the semantics are just that it's an empty selection.  (We do it this way because sometimes the bounds are generated by code and it stops people from having to have a special code path for this case.)  So I don't think we should produce an error at all in this case, we should just produce a changefeed on the empty selection (which means no actual changes, but state documents should still go through)."
