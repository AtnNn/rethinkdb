        "- [x] I have read and agreed to the RethinkDB Contributor License Agreement http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/\n### Description\n\nSome time ago I was chatting on Slack with someone about adding specs to Ruby for faster feedback etc., making it the first step towards making the driver more Ruby-like. I actually haven't had much time to finish it, but I decided to post what I have for now. In case someone thinks it's useful, I can try to add more tests to have decent coverage.\n\nRight now I covered things I was able to study and understand. Coverage according to `simple_cov` is about 51%.\n\nI may have exaggerated with mocks here and there, but the way the code is written now makes it quite hard to write tests with high coverage without heavy mocking (at least to my knowledge).\n\nSo please, let me know if you think it's useful.\n"
