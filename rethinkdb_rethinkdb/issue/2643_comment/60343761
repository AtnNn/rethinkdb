      "Currently my favourite idea is to have change feeds displayed like cursors, but with the newest row at the top and updated automatically, with a pause button. I don't think it should be different if the feed is on a range.\r\n\r\nUpdating documents with a quick background flash sounds like a great idea for regular queries. There could be a configuration option that enables it. The data explorer could show the results of `query` and run `query.changes()` in the background, updating the results live. If we implemented #523 there are a lot of other cool things we could do, such as allow editing the results directly.\r\n\r\nI will get to know the data explorer code more intimately this week. I will have a more complete proposal next week."
