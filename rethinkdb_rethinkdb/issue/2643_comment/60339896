      "@AtnNn -- could you write up a quick summary on how the UI will work? Me and @mglukhovsky care about it a lot and I have a bunch of opinions. In particular:\r\n\r\n- When the feed is on a range (e.g. `t.changes()`) I think we should show a gmail-like notification bar that says \"More changes are available\" with a link to see new changes.\r\n- When the feed is on a rage, I'm not entirely sure what to do. Perhaps we can update the document and do a quick background flash with a fadeout on the web ui. Or may be show a message saying \"the document has changed\" with a link to see the change.\r\n\r\nDo you have an idea of how you'd like to do this?"
