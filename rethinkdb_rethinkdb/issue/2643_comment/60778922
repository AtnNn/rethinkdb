      "@AtnNn -- The class `SharedResultView` was the begining of a refactoring for the data browser (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1592) or to add a data explorer per table view. It doesn't really make sense to keep it now, so removing it is a good idea.\r\n\r\nBreaking `ResultView` in multiple classes make sense, but there are a few tricks:\r\n- The links to switch view is currently in `ResultView`. You would have to take the links out of it or make pass them their container (a view has access by default to only @$el).\r\n- You would have to make QueryResult keep a copy of the displayed results (they are currently stored in `ResultView`) to be able to render a new `TreeView`/`TableView`/etc.\r\n\r\nThe third bullet point is a good idea. I'm currently passing `args` which is an object with multiple fields to `ResultView.render_result`, and it make more sense to have a proper class for that.\r\n\r\nOverall, it seems like a good idea to me, the current classes are pretty heavy (sorry :)).\r\nLet me know if you have more questions, I'm also on IRC if you need some help.\r\n\r\n"
