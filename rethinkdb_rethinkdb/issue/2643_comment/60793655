      "Ah also, if you want to quickly implement feeds without refactoring things, one way to do it is:\r\n- When you get back the response from the server, and when it is a feed, you can immediately call `result_view.render_result()`\r\n- Everytime you get new results from the feed, you can just call `result_view.add_result` (to implement) that would just add rows in `@results` and display a note \"More data available\"\r\n- Call `result_view.render_result()` every time the user click on \"More data available\""
