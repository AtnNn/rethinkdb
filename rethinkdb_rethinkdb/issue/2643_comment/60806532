      "One more thing @AtnNn, the data explorer used to support multiple queries, but we removed this at some point (I actually don't exactly remember when or why -- it was for UX reason, but also for some technical concerns related to the HTTP connections).\r\nBut the logic to handle asynchronous queries is still there (this is why we generate callbacks and check for an `id_execution`. You can remove this if you want to make the code lighter."
