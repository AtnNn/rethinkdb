        "Currently, the admin CLI acts as a member of the cluster.  If not all machines are available to the CLI, blueprint generation fails and stuff sucks.  This has been a problem for a few people, specifically ones who are working through a tunnel and it is a major hassle for them to set up forwarding so their client can reach all the members of the cluster.  Ideally, we would have the cluster do the blueprint generation (like the web UI does it), so as long as the cluster itself has full connectivity, we don't need it.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate this, we can have a mailbox on each server that will receive commands from the admin console and return the result string to be echoed to the user.  This really just involves a little decoupling in the admin console code and some reorganization, nothing major.\r\n\r\nIt may also be useful to have some mechanism to detect when blueprints are outdated due to incomplete connectivity when the semilattice change was made, then regenerate blueprints once we have full connectivity again.  Will discuss this with @jdoliner, because there may be some tricky parts to that.\r\n\r\nAssigning to myself and scheduling for 1.9 since I think this is important."
