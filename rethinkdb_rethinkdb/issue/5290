        "I added our C++ coding style from the `company` repository . There is no reason it should not be available in the public repository as far as I can tell. I didn't make any changes to the file itself, except for replacing a recommendation to compare to `NULL` by one to compare to `nullptr` (which is what new code should be doing).\n\nOnce this is merged, I'm going to remove the copy on `company`.\n\n@VeXocide would you mind doing a quick check that I'm not committing anything unreasonable?\n"
