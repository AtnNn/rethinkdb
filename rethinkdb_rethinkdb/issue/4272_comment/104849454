      "At the time that this occurred, some of the connections were failing and rejoining. Here's a theory: We lost a connection to a server and then regained the connection before we noticed we had lost the original connection. So we had two connections to the same server, and so we got a duplicate entry in the minidir.\r\n\r\nWait, no, that's impossible. None of the processed had restarted, so the reconnection attempt would use the same peer ID and so it would be rejected."
