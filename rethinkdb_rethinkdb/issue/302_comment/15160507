      "I'm not sure this is something we can really do.\r\n\r\nWe could make a shortcut that is going to add an `.orderBy()` when the user click on the a column, but we cannot execute it because\r\n- it can be an expensive query, and if the user mistakenly click on a column header, he's going to be frustrated\r\n- if the query is a write one, firing another write is just bad\r\nSo the overall experience seems just bad to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would tend to think that we should just close this issue. \r\nThe only way to have a functionality to sort the columns would be to have a data explorer when users don't write queries but just click on links."
