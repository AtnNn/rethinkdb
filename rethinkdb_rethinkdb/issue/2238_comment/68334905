      "So when it comes to things like this it needs to be accaiable of the db api and also file system. You also want to be able to filter which node has the queeries. I would not recommend file system only because then it adds extra steps for the user to cluster things. And i would not do change feeds only because then they need to run something extra and cant just tail the file. "
