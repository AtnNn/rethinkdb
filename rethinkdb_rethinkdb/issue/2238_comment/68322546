We would also need special semantics for `duration`, so you don't receive updates constantly as the `duration` of a query increases.\r\n\r\nIt's way easier to just write slow queries to a log file, configurable on a per-server basis. By setting the slow query threshold to 0, this would also give us https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/544 for free."
