        "When running unit tests, it is much faster to truncate a table and drop its indexes than to drop the whole table and recreate it between each test. It would be handy to have another arity for INDEX_DROP which didn't require an index name. This arity would drop all of the indexes on a table, and would be roughly analogous to calling `delete` without any arguments.\n\n```\ntable.indexDrop() \8594 object\ntable.indexDrop(indexName) \8594 object\n```\n\nI know I can call `indexList` and get the indexes and iterate through them, but this is a little clunky and requires more calls to the server. I'm not sure if this feasible or fits with your API goals, but wanted to present it for consideration. I searched through the issue list and couldn't see this anywhere, apologies if it's a dupe.\n"
