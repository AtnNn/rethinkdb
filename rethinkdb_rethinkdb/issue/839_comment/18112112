      "@mglukhovsky wait do they? `-v` is normally used to mean verbose which is what it means in gcc and clang. I didn't check the other ones so some of these might be legit but I think it's pretty non standard for `-v` to mean version.\r\n\r\nAlso needless to say don't merge this commit in no matter what until it compiles."
