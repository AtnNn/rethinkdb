      "@codingkevin, could you please fill out our contributor agreement form (www.rethinkdb.com/community/cla/)-- you only have to do it once. Thanks for the pull request!\r\n\r\n@srh, while some utilities and command line applications don't abbreviate `--version` as `-v`, I've found a number that do, including:\r\n\r\n  - `gcc`\r\n  - `clang`\r\n  - `ruby`\r\n  - `mc` (Midnight Commander)\r\n  - `coffee` (CoffeeScript)\r\n  - `dos2unix`\r\n\r\nThis was just from a handful of programs I have on my dev machine. This is a matter of taste and style, so I'll leave it up to others to decide whether to merge it in, but it's definitely an abbreviation used by other commands."
