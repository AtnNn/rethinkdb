      "@jdoliner, you're absolutely correct for `gcc` and `clang`-- version numbers print, but only because it's being verbose.\r\n\r\n`ruby` says `print version number, then turn on verbose mode`.\r\n\r\n`mc` actually uses `-V` (capitalized) as an abbreviation.\r\n\r\n`coffee` uses `-v` as an alias for `--version`.\r\n\r\n`dos2unix` uses `-V` (capitalized) as an abbreviation.\r\n\r\nThis seems highly dependent on style, but I have no strong opinion on whether or not we should merge this in. Just providing a few examples of commands that do. :smiley:"
