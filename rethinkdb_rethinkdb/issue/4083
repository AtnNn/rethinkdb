        "Has anybody ever thought of using RethinkDB as an distributed [eventstore](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)?\n\nBasically: \n1. having a replayable log of events that update state. \n2. These changes are then pushed to anyone subscribing. \n\nRethinkdb  has 2. covered with changefeeds. \n\nWhat would be needed to get 1 done properly?\n\nI feel this would open up RethinkDB to a whole new set of use-cases and customers, especially since Eventsourcing/ [CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) is finally getting some of the love it deserves imho.\n"
