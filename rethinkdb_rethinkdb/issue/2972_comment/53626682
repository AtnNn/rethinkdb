      "Hi @imalpha,\r\n\r\ntables in RethinkDB currently use a lot of memory, even when they are empty. The rule of thumb is at least 8 MB per table, so running out of memory with 1000 tables on an 8 GB node is sort of expected unfortunately.\r\nIs there a way you can restructure your schema to use fewer tables?\r\n\r\nWe aim to reduce the per-table memory overhead in the future, but I can't say when that will happen exactly (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1644).\r\n\r\nYou can also try reducing the cache size, but I expect that a) your performance will become quite poor if you do so and b) you will still easily run out of memory once you put more data into the tables.\r\n\r\nThis page has some information on how to configure the cache size: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/memory-usage/"
