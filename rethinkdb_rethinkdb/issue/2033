        "After talking with @coffeemug, this is a common enough operation that it should be short.\n\nHe also proposed adding optargs `group_name` and `reduction_name`, because apparently people have asked in the past for an easy way to rename the group and reduction.  (So `tbl.group('a').ungroup(group_name:'foo', reduction_name:'bar')` would have output of the form `[{foo: ..., bar: ...}, ...]`.)\n\nAny objections to this?\n"
