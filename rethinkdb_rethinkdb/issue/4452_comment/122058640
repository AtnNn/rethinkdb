      "@danielmewes - yeah, the idea is that if a user provides the incorrect file or a JSON file with syntax errors, we don't want to go into swap or hit the OOM killer.  There's a chance this will happen even with the 128 MB limit (because we can import multiple tables in parallel), but that number was chosen because it is likely larger than any individual row that can be successfully imported (barring a JSON file with a high ratio of whitespace).\r\n\r\nWe would like to avoid the OOM killer because if the import is running on the same machine as the database server, there is a good chance the OOM killer will take out the server before the import process."
