      "Hmm those are certainly valid concerns.\r\nI think the problem might be JSON files that have indentation for each line. In that case the size of a document in the file can easily be a multiple of the actual document size. @sebadiaz is that actually the case in your input or are the whitespaces coming from something else?\r\n\r\nGiven this information, maybe a command line option like `--max-document-size` to set `json_max_buffer_size` as @sebadiaz had originally implemented isn't the worst idea. I'd prefer that name over `--change-max-buffer-size` since it's less cryptic.\r\n@Tryneus do you think that would be fine?\r\n\r\nI'd leave out the `read-chunk-size` flag though.\r\n"
