      "@rightbraindev Do you mean that the files were there at first, but disappeared after a restart?\r\nCould there be any startup scripts in your system that clear out `/run` on startup? (This is common for `/var/run`, which is why I'm asking)\r\n\r\nThe error suggests that there is at least some data left in the `/run/rethinkdb/node1` directory. Which files are still in there?"
