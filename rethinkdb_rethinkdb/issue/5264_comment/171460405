      "@rightbraindev  This is a separate issue from the OP's, since in your case the already existing data files were deleted. Have you setup your own systemd configuration for starting RethinkDB, or are you using the init.d script that we provide? If you've configured your own, could you post the systemd RethinkDB configuration please? Maybe something in there is clearing out the directory...\r\n\r\nCould you also send us a copy of the `log_file` that's still there (share on http://gist.github.com , or email to daniel@rethinkdb.com)? It might contain hints on whether RethinkDB deleted those files itself or not."
