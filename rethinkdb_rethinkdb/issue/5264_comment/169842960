      "This sounds like there is no data directory at `/tmp`. Usually RethinkDB will initialize the path passed into `-d` as a data directory on first launch, but only if the directory is empty. I assume this isn't the case for `/tmp`.\r\n\r\nCan you try starting it with `rethinkdb -d /tmp/rethinkdb_data`?\r\n`rethinkdb` should then create a new subdirectory and initialize that as a data directory, creating the mentioned `metadata` file."
