Lets say you have an analtics engine for your customers and your willing to pull data and do things. You may not allow users of that level to run REALLLY long jobs so you will wanna addd a simple timeout that after some period of time rethinkdb will just return sorry the timeout has been meet. so it would drop a crazy error into the and all nodes will stop processing because they all got the timeout part of the command."
