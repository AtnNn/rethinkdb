        "Right now we generate intracluster versions automatically from the RethinkDB version number.\r\nThat is bad, because nodes from different point releases cannot connect to each other, even if the protocol hasn't actually changed. That makes updates to a new point version a bigger pain than it has to be.\r\n\r\nWe should assign cluster protocol versions manually - just like we do for the serializer - and only increase them if the protocol has actually changed.\r\n\r\n(@wojons had to suffer from this when updating his cluster recently)"
