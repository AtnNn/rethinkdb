      "that actually looks the same (as far as I can tell) the index was taking a while.\r\n\r\nBut by saying \"killed\", I feel I read the word killed in the console window at some point in time when dealing with this. Like I said (hopefully), I wish I took a picture, but I wasn't thinking at the time.\r\n\r\nGiven that I feel it's similar to #1056, I wouldn't be offended if this ticket was closed as a duplicate issue.\r\n\r\nWhoops, I only meant to comment, not close and comment. I'm new to working with github"
