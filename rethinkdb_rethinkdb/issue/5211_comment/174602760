      "I've been experiencing this as well, every time when attempting to stop or restart on fresh install and once (right now) during an upgrade. I have lines and lines of progress \"dots\", and have probably waited about 15 minutes in the upgrade case.\r\n\r\n`sudo kill` didn't do anything, but I wasn't expecting it to, and subsequent `sudo service rethinkdb stop` retain the same pid.\r\n\r\n`sudo kill -9` worked well in both cases, and didn't appear to damage the existing data.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nRunning RethinkDB 2.2.3-1 on ubuntu 14.04 using official apt repo."
