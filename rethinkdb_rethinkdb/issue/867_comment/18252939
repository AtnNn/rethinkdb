      "I heard a lot of good things about RE2\r\n\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/re2/\r\n\r\n> RE2 uses automata theory to guarantee that regular expression searches run in time linear in the size of the input. RE2 implements memory limits, so that searches can be constrained to a fixed amount of memory."
