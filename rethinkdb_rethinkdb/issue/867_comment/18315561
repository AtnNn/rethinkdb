      "What do you mean by ERE?  Do you mean POSIX ERE?  I hope so, because GNU ERE has some quaint things in it.  I think it seems like maybe we should use RE2.  Its webpage, and supported syntax, looks good.\r\n\r\nThe good regular expressions are something approaching a subset of PCRE regexps, basically what Python and Ruby have.\r\n\r\nERE has weird bracket expressions, and it lacks basic features like `\\d` that most people expect."
