      "Personally, I like the original proposal (where `match` without a function returns a boolean). In this case it seems cleaner to me to slightly complicate the interface to `match` instead of complicating the overall language by adding an extra function. The way I think of it is that if you don't provide a function to `match`, it uses one by default that returns a boolean."
