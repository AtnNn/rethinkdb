      "So, the only real issue with promiscuous truthiness is how to handle the shortcut syntax for filter.  (Since we let people use the implicit variable in the shortcut syntax, sometimes the object that people provide looks like a function  that returns an object by the time we see it on the server.)\r\n\r\nI propose we restrict the shortcut syntax in the function case to only apply if they provide either a literal DATUM or a MAKE_OBJ term."
