      "It doesn't seem too confusing to me, but I wouldn't be opposed to implementing a third function if other people think it is.  (Although I really don't like the name `is_match`.  Maybe `matches`?  Or maybe call that `matches` but rename `match` to something less ambiguous?)\r\n\r\nDoes this interface seem confusing to other people?"
