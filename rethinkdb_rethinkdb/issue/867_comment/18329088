      "> do you have an opinion on whether it's worth integrating with RE2\r\n\r\nI have no opinion, but I do have some random thoughts you might find useful in deciding.\r\n\r\n* Stuff like `[:digit:]` seems pretty terrible to me, I didn't even know there are regex libraries that use this notation. Pretty much everyone is used to what you can do in JS/RB/PY.\r\n* Most people have pretty simple needs for regex in their db, but they *really* need to satisfy those needs. They'd be cool with writing `[:digit:]` if it got them regex support sooner. Most of the time, it's wildcards anyway (e.g. \"give me all words that start with 'foo'\" -- people just need a way to express it)\r\n* SQL has a pretty terrible `LIKE` command with its own syntax for wildcards, and people put up with it fine."
