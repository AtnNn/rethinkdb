      "After talking about this with @jdoliner in person, I changed my mind. I think `match` should just return the groups, or `nil` if nothing was found. I also think that `filter` should be redefined to treat `nil` and `false` as false, and everything else as true.\r\n\r\nI think this is really nice."
