      "> We've used the POSIX regexp library elsewhere in the server, and it seems to work pretty well. I'd rather avoid adding another dependency unless we have to.\r\n\r\nIf we use <regex.h>, we'd actually be using two different implementations of regular expressions: the GNU/Linux implementation, and the OS X implementation.  We don't know if the OS X implementation is as well-done as the GNU implementation, and most importantly, the featureset of their ERE support is not identical.\r\n\r\n> @srh -- just to be clear, do you find the original syntax I proposed where `match` without a block returns a bool confusing?\r\n\r\nNo."
