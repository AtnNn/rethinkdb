The hang occurs when the starting-up process has written the following log statements:\n\n```\ninfo: Initializing directory /home/ssd2/grey/rethinkdb/src/rdb_data9\ninfo: Creating a default database for your convenience. (This is because you ran 'rethinkdb' without 'create', 'serve', or '--join', and the directory '/home/ssd2/grey/rethinkdb/src/rdb_data9' did not already exist or is empty.)\ninfo: Running rethinkdb 1.13.3-937-g30a05a-dirty (CLANG 3.2 (tags/RELEASE_32/final))...\ninfo: Running on Linux 3.2.0-67-generic x86_64\ninfo: Using cache size of 4570 MB\ninfo: Loading data from directory /home/ssd2/grey/rethinkdb/src/rdb_data9\n```\n\nAfterwards, it appears to continue on without any problems.  This issue does not occur when starting rethinkdb on an initialized data directory.\n"
