        "After upgrading our code-base to 2.1.3, we've been experiencing complete lock-ups where RethinkDB will stop accepting connections entirely, and any active ones no longer function. We haven't been able to isolate an exact cause for this phenomenon, however appears to be happening pretty much every day or so. It's worth noting that we didn't experience this issue with 2.0.4.\n\nAfter issuing a \"service rethinkdb stop\", it takes quite a while to fully stop, and then the log looks like the following: http://pastebin.com/BsSp0y9Y\n\nWe're only using 1 server, with no additional replicas or shards at this time. Our database sits at around 3.6GB, with 25 tables, and 5 secondary indexes. Our database config file can be found at http://pastebin.com/Ad7uZ3LD. I'm happy to provide any further information, as I know the lack of information here isn't fantastic!\n"
