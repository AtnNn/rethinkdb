      "Thanks for letting us know.\r\n\r\nAs you've noticed, a `distinct` is not automatically applied behind a `getAll` or `between` using a multi index. Doing so would change the memory complexity of such queries, because we would have to keep track of already seen documents (it doesn't matter if you retrieve something like 3 documents, but imagine you do a `between` and a million documents match the range).\r\n\r\nThere is one exception, which is querying multi geo indexes through `getIntersecting`. `getIntersecting` never returns duplicates (this is possible because the number of results it can produce is limited by the array size limit).\r\n\r\nWe will clarify this in the documentation."
