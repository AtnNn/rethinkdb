      "Talked a little with @coffeemug earlier. I'm a little worried that it would make debugging in some cases really tricky (but that may be because I tracked too many silly JavaScript bug).\r\n\r\nIt's also harder to change the syntax and make it stricter later (compared to making it less strict).\r\n\r\nBut I'm not strongly opposed to the current proposal -- but maybe one could be?\r\n\r\n\r\nOne last thing, `group` currently groups `null` and `undefined` as `null`. I somehow don't feel comfortable with that, but that's probably something we could easily change later if it appears to be a problem for users."
