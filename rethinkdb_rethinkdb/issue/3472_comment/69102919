      "@gchpaco had some concerns about ending up with two different versions of ICU in our binary.\r\n@AtnNn is this proposal safe in that respect?\r\n> My favourite solution is to build V8 without a bundled ICU. This will allow linking ICU like any other library, It might cause problems if v8 requires specific versions of ICU.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n> Either way, it will make it harder to use a custom `libv8`.\r\n\r\nDo we know whether that is important for our users?"
