      "My favourite solution is to build V8 without a bundled ICU. This will allow linking ICU like any other library, It might cause problems if v8 requires specific versions of ICU.\r\n\r\nAnother less elegant solution, which is what I think you describe, is to use V8's bundled ICU and copy the include files where RethinkDB can find them. This might be a lot easier to do.\r\n\r\nEither way, it will make it harder to use a custom `libv8`."
