        "Currently if we have a single table with sindexes on server A, and we reshard into 2 shards, one on server A and one on server B, we will see the following stats:\n\nServer A (backfiller):\nX reads\nX writes\n\nServer B (backfillee):\nX reads\nX + Y writes\n\nWhere X is `table.count()` and Y is the number of rows which are included in at least one secondary index tree.\n- Backfiller reads - these are from reading the rows to send to the backfillee.\n- Backfiller writes - these are from deleting the rows that were sent to the backfillee.\n- Backfillee reads - these are from reading the rows in a parallel traversal to perform sindex post-construction.\n- Backfillee writes - these are from writing the rows received from the backfiller plus writing to the secondary index trees in sindex post-construction.\n\nInstead, I would expect the backfill to have these stats (as to not look artificially inflated):\nServer A (backfiller):\nX reads\nX writes\n\nServer B (backfillee):\n0 reads\nX writes\n\nCurrently sindexes are counted extra for reads and writes only during `index_create` and in backfills.  This would simplify that to only during `index_create`.  Opinions?\n"
