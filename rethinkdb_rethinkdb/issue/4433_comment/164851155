      "@gvidon: for clarity, were you trying the currently shipping Python driver, the one from the PR #5126, or the one from the branch @Tryneus is working on (`grey_python_gevent`)? I would not expect it to work on the currently shipping one, and would need to do some testing specifically to make sure even the in-development version works specifically with `gevent-socketio`."
