      "I don't know if `pip` knows about `make`files, so I am worried that @renstrom's instructions are missing one step before the last:\r\n```make --directory ./rethinkdb/drivers/python```\r\nThis runs `make` in that directory, which will make sure that the driver is complete. Technically this creates the finished version in `./rethinkdb/build/drivers/python`, but for ease of development it also copies the one file that needs to be created into ` ./rethinkdb/drivers/python` as well. So for this purpose they are equivalent."
