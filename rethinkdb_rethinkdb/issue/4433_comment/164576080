      "Have recently tried changefeed with gevent-socketio and it didn't work \8212\160```self.emit()``` doesn't work when ```r.table(...).changes().run()``` called in the same method of namespace class. No error messages. \r\n\r\nTried patching everything with ```gevent.monkey.patch_all()```, but it didn't help. Is it going to be fixed soon or I missed something and do it wrong?"
