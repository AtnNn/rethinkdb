      "Ya.. @nickmishustin is right... in my one more line there should have been two:\r\n```\r\n./configure\r\nmake --directory ./rethinkdb/drivers/python\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `configure` script does check for a lot of things that are not necessary to only build this one part. I am going to file a separate issue (#5329) to think about that. I am also going to ping @danielmewes to see if we should sync all of the driver changes from `next` to `v2.2.x` and put out a release?"
