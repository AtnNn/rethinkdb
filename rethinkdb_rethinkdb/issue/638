We should probably drop it all together (same for `rethinkdb proxy`)\r\n* EDIT: there should be no `--input-file`. It should just be the last nameless, required parameter\r\n\r\nWe probably shouldn't change any of this until we rewrite the import command all together (see #91), but when we do, we should fix these issues.
