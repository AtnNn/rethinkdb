      "Spoke with @mlucy, since using `.order_by( \"field\" ).changes() ` returns the \"Cannot do changes on eager stream...etc\" error also `.order_by({\"index\": \"field\"}).changes()` should (in my expectations) return the same since it cannot guarantee order in the changefeed result since it would involve loading the entire table into memory. \r\n\r\nIf there's an efficient way to make this possible using a secondary index, then that'd be cool :+1: "
