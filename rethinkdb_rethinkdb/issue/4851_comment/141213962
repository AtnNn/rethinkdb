      "@danielmewes Yes I'd like that and think that should be implemented. But I don't think that's what I was initially trying to do here since I wasn't using `.limit( ... )`\r\n\r\nI think though that `.order_by( ... ).changes( ... )` should be possible even if my table is large for use cases where I want to know about changes in ordering for the entire table.  \r\n\r\n"
