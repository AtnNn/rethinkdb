      "@dalanmiller Well without the positions in each change notification, you can still maintain an ordered list of results on your client relatively easily. I'm not sure if there are actually many use cases for this, but I don't think we should disallow it in general. Once we add an option to add position data in #3714, using that flag in combination with a non-limited `order_by().changes()` would definitely return an error."
