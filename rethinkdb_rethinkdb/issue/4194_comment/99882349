      "@StevenPerez: actually, I was saying that the case @danielmewes stated is ambiguous and is a good reason for adding an `action` to the changefeed, so we're in agreement:\r\n\r\n> Incidentally, our current system also breaks if you have a changefeed like this:\r\n> `r.table('t1')('a').changes()`\r\n> and you set the value of a to null for a document. The generated change event will be indistinguishable from a deletion. Additionally, when deleting a document that currently has a: null, no change event is generated."
