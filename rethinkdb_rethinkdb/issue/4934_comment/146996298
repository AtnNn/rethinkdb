      "Failover should usually take in the range of 15 seconds.\r\nIf you could send me a copy of the log_file from the different servers for the time where you had the primary down, that might be helpful to figure out where things went wrong. My email is daniel@rethinkdb.com .\r\n\r\nDuring the failover period, queries will fail, so retrying on `ReqlOpFailedError` exceptions is often the right approach. You can add in a `r.db(...).wait()` into the loop, which avoids busy-waiting (it will only return when the next operation on that database is expected to succeed again)."
