      "That's really odd. When one of the proxies on a different node goes down, do you have to restart it manually or does it recover by itself eventually?\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused by some lines in the log file. Is it possible that you are using the same `log_file` for both the actual server and a proxy? I recommend using separate log files to make debugging easier and to avoid corrupting the log in case both processes try to write to it at the same time. Though that's most likely unrelated to the issue at hand.\r\n\r\n"
