      "One possible source of issues could be that proxies right now appear to try connecting to each other.\r\nIf all of the proxies only bind to `localhost`, different proxies might try to establish connections to `localhost` to reach some of the other proxies. However there they won't find the expected other proxies, but will end up connecting to themselves of course.\r\nI don't see any indication of that happening in the log file, but it's the only thing I can think of that could maybe cause some issues.\r\n\r\nCould you try adding the following argument to the proxies?\r\n`--canonical-address 1.1.1.1`\r\nYou can alternatively put that in the proxys' instance configurations like so:\r\n`canonical-address=1.1.1.1`\r\n\r\n(I'm using 1.1.1.1 here as an address that just doesn't exist. I hope that's true. At least it doesn't appear to respond to pings)\r\n\r\nThis should stop proxies from trying to connect to each other, which might or might not help.\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't we'll have to investigate this further."
