      "The failover not happening is also weird. Can all servers connect to each other or could there be some firewall restrictions between them that make connections only work in one direction?\r\n\r\nChangefeeds currently always get interrupted if the primary fails. 2.1.5 fixed a race condition that sometimes made it impossible to create new changefeeds even *after* the primary had come back up (or a failover was performed)."
