      "The fact that our proxies currently want to be reachable from the other cluster nodes is very annoying and I think we should definitely change that.\r\n\r\nThough I think that even if the proxy isn't reachable from the other server, the proxy should still reach out to the other server on its own and be able to connect to it.\r\n@hamiltop Is there a chance that the network configuration blocked connections in both directions, i.e. also from the proxy to the other server?\r\n\r\nIf not we definitely need to investigate this more."
