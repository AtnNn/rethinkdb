      "We're changing the reconnection logic for proxies in order to fix https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5456 . In the future, servers (including proxies) won't try to connect to a proxy more than once. Instead the proxy itself will be responsible for reconnecting to all servers once it loses a connection.\r\n\r\nThis might resolve this issue as well, though I'm not sure since we have never been able to reproduce it."
