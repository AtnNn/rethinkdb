      "@hamiltop: was that last `Cannot perform read:` for just a moment, or did it last? If it was done immediately after either the server coming back up, or after the reconfigure then it would be expected: there is a brief moment during handover where there is no primary for a shard. We do this to guarantee that there are never two primaries (and the incumbent possibilities of data corruption/loss). There is [an issue](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4331) open already to auto-retry queries that fall in this hole, but it has not yet been scheduled."
