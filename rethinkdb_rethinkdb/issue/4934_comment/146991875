      "I'm running all of these on compute engine and I've set every canonical address to their local address for each config that host the database. And all internal IPs have all ports unblocked, so I don't think that's the case. I see them all connected in the admin panel with no issues reported. How long does the failover recovery take approximately?\r\n\r\nWould the appropriate approach be to catch the error and then continuously retry or is there a better way of handling this?\r\n\r\nI will try to set the canonical address of the proxy instances and give it a try later today during non-peak hours.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
