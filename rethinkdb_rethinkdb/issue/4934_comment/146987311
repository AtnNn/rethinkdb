      "Yes, sorry. I am using the same log_file for actual server and proxy. This is because I wanted the logs to update on the admin console.\r\n\r\nAnd to answer your question, I have to restart it manually, or else it will continue to say primary replica not found in my application code.\r\n\r\nSomething unrelated, but I have 4 replicas of a table, but when the primary replica goes down, it doesn't seem to do the failover recovery by electing a new primary replica (or at least not in a quick time) and causes all my application code to fail. It also crashes the changefeed (although I think I saw something about this in the bug fixes for 2.1.5?)"
