      "I've just noticed a bunch of different issues with proxy that may or may not be related. Here's a big one:\r\n\r\n1. Bring up cluster of 3 servers.\r\n2. Set one table to 3 shards with 3 replicas.\r\n3. Start proxy on local node. Proxy connects to all servers.\r\n4. Terminate one server. Rebuild server.\r\n5. Reconfigure table to 3 shards with 3 replicas.\r\n6. Try to query data whose primary shard is on new server.\r\n\r\nIt seems the proxy is never made aware of the new server once the table is reconfigured. It throws `\"Cannot perform read: primary replica for shard [\\\"SaY\\\\x7D\\\\x01\\\\x9D\\\", \\\"Scc\\\\x7E\\\\xA2F\\\") not available\"`\r\n\r\nThis might even be reproducible by simply adding a new shard.\r\n\r\nWorth filing a new ticket? or related to this?"
