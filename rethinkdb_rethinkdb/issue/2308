        "It would be nice if our RDB_MAKE_ME_SERIALIZABLE format was version aware.\n\nThe fix to #2251 for example changes the file format because a new flag is added to the serializable `secondary_index_t` structure. However the value of that flag can be interfered easily when loading older data files (it's always false).\nUnfortunately there's no way to figure out whether the serialization of a `secondary_index_t` is from an older version that doesn't have the flag or from a newer one that has the flag. So we can not handle old versions, even if we wanted to.\nAs a consequence this bug cannot be fixed for 1.12.x (except by using weird hacks).\n\nI think we should prefix the serialization of every object by a version number. This gives us a way to handle older data where it makes sense.\n\nHaving an LTS version with a stable format is _no real alternative_ to this. Say it turns out that the LTS format has to be amended for fixing some critical bug. In such a case we can maintain compatibility if we already have versions in the serialized data, but have no chance to do it if we don't.\n"
