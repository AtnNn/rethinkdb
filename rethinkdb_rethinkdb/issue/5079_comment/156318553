      "FWIW, this particular user would have known to write `.contains()` instead of `in` in your example, but got bit by the above (and ended up with the same workaround you proposed). In any case, raising an error sounds like a more principled fix, and even though it wouldn't allow the code I quoted, at least it would fail loudly, so +1 on the error. Thanks for taking a look at this :)"
