      "We could override `__contains__` to customize the `in` operator's behavior to avoid the ast-returning `__eq__` implementation\r\n\r\nThis is a weird operation though, since I don't think we really worry about what equality for a reql ast is. We should probably just override `__contains__` to throw an error since it shouldn't be used like that."
