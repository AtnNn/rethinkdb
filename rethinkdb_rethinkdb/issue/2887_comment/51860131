      "This is how `driver.py` currently works on `dict`s: it compares all of the keys in the expected output and makes sure that the comparison target has values for those keys and that they match.\r\n\r\nYour expectation makes sense to me. And the change for that is small, but I need to runs test to see how many tests currently depend on this detail (running). Timing is bad for today, so I will have results tomorrow morning."
