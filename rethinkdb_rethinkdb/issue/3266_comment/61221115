      "I see some disadvantages to this proposal.\r\n\r\n* Many tools and libraries, such as the Web UI and ORMs, do not let users specify optargs to `run`.\r\n* All other optargs to `run`, except for `db`, modify the performance or the return value of the whole query. `identifier_format` would modify the results of operations within the query, which seems undesirable to me.\r\n* Queries would no longer be composable. The behaviour of some sub-queries would be dependent on a flag that is outside their control, and composing them with other sub-queries that depend on a different value for this flag will be impossible.\r\n* It seems very surprising that a given table would have two different schemas.\r\n* It might lead users to believe that table names and ids written to regular tables are affected."
