      "> In stats, the primary keys will always be of the form [\"table\", <UUID>], [\"server\", <UUID>], etc. even if identifier_format is \"name\". (@danielmewes: Your #2885 (comment) appears to contradict my proposal here, but I'm not sure.)\r\n\r\nI think always having the UUIDs in the primary key is fine and even desired. I only meant the `server_id`, `table_id` and `db_id` fields that we still had in the latest proposal in addition to the primary key."
