      "It's bad that this proposal is describing an optarg for run and not an optarg for the specific query.  Also, if it is changed to be on the query methods itself, note that while we currently make optargs passed to run be default values for any optargs inside the query, we've considered this a bad idea (also one that nobody uses) and might eliminate that behavior."
