      "Anecdotally, I write `arr.contains(LITERAL)` at least once a month (often for queries like `r.table('test').filter{|row| row['tags'].contains(SOME_TAG)}`) and have never once wanted to write `arr.contains(PATHSPEC)`.  Checking for set membership seems like a much more common operation than testing whether any objects in an array match a pathspec."
