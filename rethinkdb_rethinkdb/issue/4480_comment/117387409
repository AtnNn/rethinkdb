      "Making `r.expr([1, 2, 3]).count(x)` count the number of occurences of `x` seems both intuitive and useful to me.  I would guess most people using Python or Ruby would expect that to work, and having to write `r.expr([1, 2, 3]).count(function(row){ return row.eq(x);})` instead is actually kind of annoying.\r\n\r\nI don't think there are a lot of people expecting it to use pathspecs and then being extremely confused when it instead counts literal objects.  (Or, at least, I haven't seen questions about it before.)\r\n\r\nCounting the number of occurences also the current behavior, and the bar for removing behavior people might be using is higher than the bar for not including it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI would be moderately strongly opposed to removing the `arr.count(x)` behavior.  @coffeemug, what do you think?"
