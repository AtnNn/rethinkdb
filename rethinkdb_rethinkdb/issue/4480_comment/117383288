      "I agree we should make `foo.filter('bar')` not silently turn into `foo`.  I'm not 100% sure whether we should make it error or turn into `foo.filter{|x| x['bar']}`.  I'm also not sure whether `foo.filter(true)` should continue silently turning into `foo`.\r\n\r\nI think I would strongly expect `arr.count(3)` to count the number of 3s in `arr`.  That's also the behavior in Python and Ruby."
