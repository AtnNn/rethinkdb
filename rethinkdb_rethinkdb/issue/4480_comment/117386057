      "I think `.filter(3/\"foo\")` and `.count(3/\"foo\")` should error. That would correct anyone looking for ruby or python behavior, and unambiguously emphasize that it isn't doing a bracket or anything either. Ruby and Python don't have pathspecs, and in the context of reql I think it's more consistent"
