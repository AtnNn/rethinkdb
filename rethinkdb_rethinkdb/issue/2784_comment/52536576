      "I think it's fine for a couple of reasons:\r\n\r\n- People take advantage of this functionality (changing values on two sides of a netsplit) extremely rarely if ever, and it's usually by accident.\r\n- If a metadata conflict does happen, empirically people are very surprised and have no idea how to fix it. They're also frustrated that they have to deal with the issue.\r\n- It's temporary. Eventually we'll replace this with a consensus algorithm so conflicts couldn't happen period.\r\n\r\nI think timestamp-based resolution would result in a dramatically better user experience when the edge cases do happen. It's probably not ideal for large deployments, but for the moment there are much bigger issues in those scenarios anyway. By the time we fix those, we'll probably also add a consensus algorithm so this problem will go away."
