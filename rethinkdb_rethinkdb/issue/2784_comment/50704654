      "Well, \"much simpler\" is the wrong word. A typical user will rarely encounter vector clock conflicts. But I think they will be quite inconvenient when they do occur; the user will probably see them as a hassle. This will be especially true with the new ReQL admin API, because we'll encourage people to use scripts to configure their cluster. Vector clock conflicts are important if two humans make different changes at the same time, and also it's rare for human admins to create a vector clock conflict; but with automated configuration tools, the risk of a coincidence is higher, and the probability that the conflict is actually worth bothering the user about is lower."
