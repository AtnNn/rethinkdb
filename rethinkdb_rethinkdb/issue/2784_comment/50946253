      "On further thought, the proposal to have the system raise an error if the user tries to read a vector clock conflict is hard to implement. Currently, we implement writes as a function that maps the old value to the new value; we would have to distinguish between writes that use the old value and writes that don't. It seems to me that naive timestamp-based resolution is significantly easier to implement than either of the vector-clock solutions."
