      "We appear to be affected by https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=4665 because we use node.js' `Buffer` implementation.\r\n\r\nThat makes the `slice` call in this line `responseBuffer = this.buffer.slice(12, responseLength + 12);` fail. (this.buffer is of type `Uint8Array`, but with annotations that swap out the `slice` implementation by the one from `Buffer` as far as I can tell)."
