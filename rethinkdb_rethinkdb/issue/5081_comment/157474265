      "@lijialing888 Pretty sure that's the same problem. We've just released RethinkDB 2.2.1 with a fix for this. Could you upgrade to that version and try again? You might want to read the 2.2.0 release notes for details on backwards compatiblity and migration: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/releases/tag/v2.2.0"
