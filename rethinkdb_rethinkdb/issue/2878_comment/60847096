      "Going to garbage collect the above todos from Michel, and add remaining tasks as I find them here:\r\n\r\n## Required\r\n- [ ] Logs are missing (#2884 needed)\r\n- [x] table page should use reconfigure for the shard/replication settings (issue #3229)\r\n- [ ] Issue for invalid configs due to permanently removed machines (#3256)\r\n- [ ] the issues collection never gets removed from, just added to (#3490)\r\n- [x] add -ms- prefixes for flexbox usage\r\n- [ ] remove links to database page, add \"rename database\" link to tables page (#3491)\r\n- [ ] Issues panel gets collapsed even if it's open when the status bar refetches. (#3492)\r\n- [x] Break out failable calls into separate query loop (#3468)\r\n- [ ] Fix \"N/A\" and \"Unknown\" labels when the numbers of docs is zero (#3452)\r\n\r\n## Layout Polish (required)\r\n- [ ] We're missing a 4th Monitor since consistency is out (#3493)\r\n    - @timmaxw and @danielmewes have some ideas on what should replace it\r\n- [ ] Get rid of the \"Please wait\" message in its current form. Instead try rendering the page asap, maybe with the more costly parts of the data (like distribution) appearing only later. (#3494)\r\n- [ ] Whenever a query or something else fails in the web UI, it currently prints the error message in an ugly way (without line breaks etc.). Maybe we could display something like \"Sorry, something went wrong while retrieving data from the server. Please report this issue at https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/ . The failure is: [error message]\" (#3495)\r\n- [ ] Remove slideDown animation on secondary index panel (#3496)\r\n- [ ] (#3497) When you first load the table view (clicking the table view from the table list), a yellow popup appears above the shard distribution graph, that says \"Loading...\" and slides up. This is visually distracting, especially because it's yellow. Could we:\r\n    - [ ] just show an empty graph until the shard distribution is loaded (show the axes but no bars)\r\n    - [ ] put the words \"Loading...\" in the center of the graph, with no colors, just the text\r\n- [ ] The \"Loading table\" headline at the top of the table view should use the Copse font, so it's not too visually distracting. (#3496)\r\n- [ ] Choose a more subtle way to show that the secondary indexes and server lists are loading. (similar to the suggestion for the shard distribution graph) -- currently the yellow popups are very distracting. (#3497)\r\n\r\n### All below issues are fixed in CR 2406\r\n- [x] Headline of \"Data distribution\" is not in headline style\r\n- [x] Headline \"Configuration\" should be \"Shards and replicas\"\r\n- [x] Server list on table page and in reconfiguration modal: \"Secondary Replica\" is capitalized, should be \"Secondary replica\"\r\n- [x] Reconfiguration modal: Collapse the server assignment by default\r\n- [x] Reconfiguration modal: Put the legend to the bottom (below the scroll box, but inside the collapsible)\r\n- [x] Reconfiguration modal: Remove approximate number of docs\r\n- [x] Reconfiguration modal: Center square dot at the left with \"Shard 1\"\r\n- [x] Reconfiguration modal: Strike through the role (e.g. \"Secondary replica\") on removed servers\r\n- [x] Reconfiguration modal: When adding a new shard, don't make \"Shard n\" bold (or make it consistent with removed shards)\r\n- [x] Reconfiguration modal: If server role changes, remove the red box around the change. Instead put the *new* role in orange (same orange that currently primaries are put in on the table page).\r\n- [x] Reconfiguration modal: +/- icons should have less intense colors, and should be scaled down to match the font size in the modal (and their padding to the text must be matched as well)\r\n- [x] Reconfiguration modal: Red background for removed replicas should be even less intense\r\n- [x] Reconfiguration modal: Validate number of replicas and shards on the client side, to give more concise error messages. The errors given by the server for `reconfigure` with wrong parameters don't work well in the web UI context.\r\n- [x] Reconfiguration modal: Match the font size of the \"Apply\" button to the font size of the #shards / #replicas boxes. Also change the caption of the button to \"Apply changes\".\r\n- [x] Reconfiguration modal: Edit boxes for # shards / # replicas should be narrower (same width as in the old UI)\r\n\r\n## Lower Priority / Polish\r\n- [ ] Add pseudotables to auto-completion for `.table()` in data explorer (#3496)\r\n    - also add description for each\r\n- [ ]  Secondary indexes on table page is always \"Loading...\" for a table that is unavailable (#3497)\r\n- [ ] Data distribution graph disappears entirely when distribution is unavailable, it should show an error (#3497)\r\n- [ ] Icon next to table status on table page is always a green icon. It should change color if the table is not ready (#3500)\r\n- [x] Table page doesn't update when table status changes\r\n- [X ] Adding a secondary index through the web-ui should immediately update the secondary indexes panel, rather than waiting for the next 5s batch\r\n- [ ] Backfill progress is currently based on shards in the \"available\" state (#3499)\r\n  - After discussing this with Daniel, it's unlikely a better version will go into 1.16\r\n\r\n## Done\r\n- [X] Hook /ajax/me back up once it's back in the server (#2979 needed, up in CR 2268)\r\n  - [x] currently uuid is being shown, needs servername (in CR 2268)\r\n- [x] Server page has an inaccurate status (up in CR 2268)\r\n- [x] Data distribution on table page is fake (#2980 needed, up in CR 2268)\r\n- [X] Need to get shard data per server  (#2890 needed, up in CR 2268)\r\n    - [X] server view\r\n    - [X] distribution graph on table view\r\n- [x] load/remove buttons in dataexplorer history are piled on top of each other (up in CR 2268)\r\n- [x] issues listing (issue #2864, approved in CR 2253, in reql_admin)\r\n- [x] Verbiage changes (approved in CR 2262, in reql_admin)\r\n    - [x] \"machine\" -> \"server\"\r\n    - [x] \"uuid\" -> \"id\"\r\n    - [x] \"director\" -> \"primary\" in code (UI \"Primary replica\")\r\n    - [x] \"primary\" -> \"Primary replica\" in UI\r\n- [x] Server page table link is broken because it doesn't use a uuid (up in CR 2268)\r\n- [X] table list has `?` for status of tables (in CR 2268)\r\n- [X] uses of `table_status` need to change since the structure changed (CR 2268)\r\n- [X] tables widget in the topbar always says 0 tables available (CR 2268)\r\n- [x] Fix font size in data explorer history (#3413)\r\n- [x] Swap Load/delete buttons in data explorer history (#3414)\r\n- [x] Stats hooked up (#2885 needed)\r\n"
