      "The ReQL admin commands are being added to the JS driver as they are created. For example, `tableConfig` and `tableStatus` are already available in the `reql_admin` branch.\r\n\r\nWe might want to overhaul the table page. The current layout emphasizes the number of shards and replicas, and lets the user change them easily; it shows the specific servers but only at the bottom of the page. I suspect this will be confusing now that server is no longer directly storing the number of shards and replicas. I propose that we show the user the contents of `rethinkdb.table_config` and `rethinkdb.table_status` (in a visual format) and allow them to edit `table_config` directly; and we also give them a button to call `reconfigure()` as an action."
