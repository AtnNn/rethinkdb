      "I don't think we should separate out the HTTP server. After these changes are complete, all that's left of the HTTP server will be a bunch of static resources and the ReQL-HTTP gateway. There's little cost to leaving that in the C++ server and it wouldn't make a very interesting example app. If we want to update the admin app independently of the server, we can ship new versions of the static resources. Also, I think the deployment issues would be pretty annoying.\r\n\r\nIt's sort of appealing from an elegance point of view, but I don't think it's practical."
