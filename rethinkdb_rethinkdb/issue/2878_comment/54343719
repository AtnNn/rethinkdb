      "@coffeemug asked me to write what I need to move forward on the web interface:\r\n\r\nThe most important thing I need is an update of `table_status`, it's the backbone of most of the views.\r\n- `table_status`:\r\n  - Structure of table_status: Issue #2983\r\n  - Is the table available for writes?\r\n  - Is the table available for reads?\r\n  - number of documents per shards\r\n\r\nThen things that are currently not available:\r\n- stats\r\n- logs\r\n- issues\r\n\r\nFor the rest, I can work around for now and update things as the new API is shipped (I think)."
