      "Another question (you mentioned earlier) is whether we want to rip out the http infrastructure from the RethinkDB process entirely, and rewrite it in a more traditional way (e.g. Python) that communicates with the server via a driver interface.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n- Makes the server simpler\r\n- Makes the admin tool easier to modify for a wider range of people\r\n- Potentially makes it possible to deploy the admin tool updates separately from the server\r\n- Gives us an excellent example app that we can share with people more easily\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n- The current setup already works. Do we want to invest time into this now? (It's important we ship the new clustering API ASAP, so if this is a significant effort, we should take the extra time very seriously)\r\n- Potential packaging/UX issues. If Rethink starts the web process, will the users have a seamless experience as they do now? How hard is this to package?"
