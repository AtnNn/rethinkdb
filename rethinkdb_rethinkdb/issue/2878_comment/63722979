      "Quick note about\r\n> Backfill progress is currently based on shards in the \"available\" state\r\n\r\nThe backfilling progress reported is kind of unstable and using the number of available shards makes a better experience because if the progress bar is built on the ratio of blocks copied/left\r\n- Bars could go back, and caching the value to prevent the bar from going back doesn't work that well and is a bit tricky to implement (you have to consider changing the number of shards and replicas, which may not happen at the same time).\r\nThe reason why secondary indexes progress are fetched with a delay of one second delay is for this. I tried the same trick for backfilling, but it wasn't working that well (not sure why).\r\n- It's also not human readable to have both numbers of blocks copied/left to change every seconds\r\n \r\nExcept if the backfilling report has been improved (by knowing from the beginning how many blocks need to be copied), it's probably not a good idea to the number of blocks copied to build a progress bar.
