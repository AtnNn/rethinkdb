      "Definitely I can send you over a modified version of Rethink tomorrow. A few questions:\r\n\r\n- What version, architecture and OS are you running on?\r\n- are you equipped to compile Rethink from source? If I could just send you over a patch that you could apply and build that would probably be the surest way to get all of the above correct. Don't worry about it if you're not, it really shouldn't be too hard to compile a binary for the target.\r\n- what time zone are you in? Things will probably go smoothest if we can get on IRC together and chat live. I'm in PST and should online ready to go by 11 PST."
