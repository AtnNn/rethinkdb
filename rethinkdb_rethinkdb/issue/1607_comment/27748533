      "I'm on Rethink v1.10.0, Slackware linux 13.37 x86_64. \r\n\r\nA patch would be awesome, since I'm able to recompile (and it would be cool to see how you're fixing it just from a \"interested in the internals\" point of view). Also, I'm in Pacific time as well. 11am works fine for me tomorrow, I'll jump into #rethinkdb then. I really appreciate you taking the time to help with this!"
