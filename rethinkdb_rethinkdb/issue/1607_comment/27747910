      "Hi @orthecreedence sorry you ran in to this. I'm betting that this is a manifestation of #1389. The good news is I think there's a very good chance we'll be able to recover your data since it seems only the secondary indexes are corrupted. The easiest thing would probably be if you could just get us the data files. Would that be feasible? We'd be happy to sign an NDA."
