      "To rehash (and expand) the argument for the reader's convenience:\r\n\r\n- Right now we only support running one query on a connection at a time, and return the results of a query before evaluating subsequent queries.\r\n- Fast queries should not have to wait for predictively run slow queries to finish.\r\n- Slow range queries don't have the ability to return short results early, so they could take a large amount of time.\r\n- Change feeds add an automatic lag to any query that follows a change feed cursor retrieval.\r\n- The user might not want to do expensive queries like `r.http` without explicitly requesting them.\r\n- Users that want to do intensive processing on a cursor quickly can push the data to a different worker thread, or an explicit prefetch function on cursor objects could be exposed."
