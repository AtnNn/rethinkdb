      "We should probably make prefetching configurable in the drivers, e.g. in terms of an optional argument to `run()`.\r\n\r\nSince we can detect change feeds by their different return type, we could turn it off by default for change feeds.\r\nApart from change feeds, I think most applications will get the best performance by having prefetching turned on. So we could have it turned on by default in the non-changefeed case."
