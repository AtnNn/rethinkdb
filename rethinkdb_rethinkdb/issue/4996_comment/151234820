      "Thanks, the patch looks good to me.\r\n\r\nAre you familiar with the tests in `test/rql_test`? You can run them through the `test-runner` script in that folder. The test definitions are in `src` (`test-runner` refers to those tests as `polyglot` tests). It would be great to have a test for the new behavior.\r\nIf you don't want to deal with that, we can also add the tests later on our side."
