      "@marshall007 You are correct that changing the `replace` to `do` takes approximately the same amount of time (in fact, the query times out). More importantly, I actually get helpful query profile information, now!\r\n\r\n> `Perform write on shard.` is a catch-all phrase that includes both evaluating the expression in the body of the `replace` and performing the write to disk, not just the latter.\r\n\r\nWow. Thank you for pointing that out. That makes the query profiler **super unhelpful** though! \128542 "
