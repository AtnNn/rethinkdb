      "@colegleason I looked through the file you sent me, and I don't see anything obviously wrong. In particular, I don't see any vector clock conflicts. I'm not sure what's going on here. My working theory is that something is causing a vector clock conflict at runtime, but this conflict is not being persisted to disk.\r\n\r\nCan you be more specific about how you trigger the crash? What query or command do you run, and how do you run it?"
