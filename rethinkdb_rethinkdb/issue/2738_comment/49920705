      "Hi @colegleason, sorry you ran into this bug. Were you able to start your cluster normally after the crash, or did you see the same error again?\r\n\r\nIt looks like the problem is that the `namespace_repo_t` is not tolerating vector clock conflicts in the metadata. You can cause a vector clock conflict by issuing configuration changes to two servers simultaneously. The system is supposed to work properly even if there's a vector clock conflict, but it's a rare enough condition that we haven't tested this particular scenario properly. If the nodes crashed before they flushed the metadata to disk, then your cluster should work fine after you restart; but if the vector clock conflict is stored on disk, then you will get the crash again every time you try to start the cluster."
