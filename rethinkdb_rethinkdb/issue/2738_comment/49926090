      "@colegleason, hmm, the next way I would look for the field in conflict is through `http://<host>:<web ui port>/ajax/semilattice`, or inspecting individual objects in the `rethinkdb admin` console.  I'll need to look into why there is no issue for the conflict.  I assume the conflict is on the number of replicas, but let me know if you find it."
