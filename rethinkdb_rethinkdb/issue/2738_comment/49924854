      "Do you have important data stored in the affected table? If so, let's work on trying to recover that data. Here are some things to try:\r\n\r\n1. What type of \"access\" triggers the error? In particular, does RethinkDB crash if you try to change settings in the web UI? If you can make a change to the settings for the affected table, such as increasing the number of replicas, this might cause RethinkDB to overwrite the metadata that contains the vector clock conflict.\r\n\r\n2. Do you have backups of the actual RethinkDB data directory? If you haven't made any major changes to the configuration since the last time you backed up, try restoring the `metadata` file from backup.\r\n\r\n3. If neither of those works, the only other thing I can think of is to manually edit the metadata files to fix the corruption. Unfortunately, the format isn't human-readable; but if you send the `metadata` file for each of your servers I can try to edit it. You can email the files to tim@rethinkdb.com.\r\n\r\nAgain, sorry you encountered this bug."
