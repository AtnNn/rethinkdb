      "Thanks @timmaxw . There is no important data in these tables as I just created them. I attempted to delete the database and recreate them, but I encountered the same bug.\r\n\r\nWe don't have backups of the actual directory, just the output of `rethinkdb dump`.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus I don't see any open issues when running that. The web interface doesn't show any either."
