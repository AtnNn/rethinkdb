      "If you email the metadata files to me, you would have to send me all three of the files; and then when I send them back, you would have to shut down all three servers, copy over all three metadata files, then restart all three servers. Any configuration changes you make after sending the file to me would be lost.\r\n\r\nYou probably wouldn't consider any of the data in the metadata files to be sensitive. Specifically, they contain the following:\r\n* The names of the tables, databases, servers, and datacenters\r\n* Replication and sharding information for all the tables\r\n* The name of the primary key for each table\r\n* Which datacenter each server belongs to"
