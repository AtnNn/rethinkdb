      "I don't really feel like the client lib should do much to make this case easier for users, since initialization logic is better handled as part of an ORM, or a lightweight specialized-query-builder like [endex](https://github.com/stuartpb/endex), and ORMs/SQBs can take the hit of writing their own branch queries (maybe even layering something on top of it beyond just an existence check, like checking what schema version a table is written for)."
