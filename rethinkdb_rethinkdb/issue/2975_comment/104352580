      "@danielmewes while the CP semantics proposed in #4251 are welcomed, we are unlikely to use the feature if it means storing all tables in a single file per node for all the reasons mentioned by @larkost in #2498. In addition, not being able to reconfigure individual tables would likely also make use of the feature unfeasible.  I'd expect we'd want to increase the number of shards of tables that grow beyond certain size, while leaving other tables as they are."
