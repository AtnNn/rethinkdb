      "`table_create` and other similar state modification operations should require consensus.   From what I've learned, I expect RethinkDB to be a CP system, not AP.  Not being fully CP or AP, being neither fish nor fowl, is not that helpful.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to Raft and RethinkDB passing the Jepsen tests."
