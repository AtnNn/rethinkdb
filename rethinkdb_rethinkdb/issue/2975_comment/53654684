      "Indeed, I intended to run this for every instance of my web app on start up. My idea was that this might be a  middle-ground solution to what I think is partly desired in #2355 - avoiding the necessity to have a bootstrap step that is usually part of setting of a traditional database.\r\n\r\nI'm absolutely new to RethinkDB, but why is it not possible to make ``table_create`` atomic on the server? In fact, isn't the server allowing a duplicate table a pretty clear bug?"
