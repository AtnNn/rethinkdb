      "@deontologician I think my initial comment was succinct.  I opined that table management operations, such as table creation, should be consistent and  not suffer from race conditions.  The documentation presents RethinkDB as a CP system, and I expect it to behave as such throughout, at least by default.\r\n\r\nBut maybe you are referring to my comments about DC replication?  That's a separate issue, but I can rephrase my comments regarding that if you wish. "
