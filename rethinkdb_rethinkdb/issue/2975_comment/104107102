      "Ah, maybe you were asking why I found @stuartpb's comment objectionable, aside from the armchair quaterbacking without knowledge of the use case.  I could share the use case with you, but it seems immaterial to the discussion of this issue.  I rather not pollute the comments further.  But if you are interested, I'll gladly share the information with you. "
