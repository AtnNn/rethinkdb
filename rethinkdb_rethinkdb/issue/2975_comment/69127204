      "> I assert that the failure mode of two tables with the same name would be pretty confusing / catastrophic\r\n\r\nI believe it would make all queries that try to access the table fail, because its name is ambiguous. Renaming the table would resolve it, but currently requires going through the web UI (starting from 1.16 it can be done as a ReQL query)."
