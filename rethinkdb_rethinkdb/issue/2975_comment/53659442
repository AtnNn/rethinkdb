      "> I'm absolutely new to RethinkDB, but why is it not possible to make ``table_create`` atomic on the server? \r\n\r\nTo add to @timmaxw's comment, making this operation atomic comes with a pretty heavy cost -- a call to `table_create` would require cluster coordination. That would make the command significantly slower and it's not immediately clear whether it's a good idea to require N/2+1 servers in the cluster in order to create tables. The drawback is pretty significant."
