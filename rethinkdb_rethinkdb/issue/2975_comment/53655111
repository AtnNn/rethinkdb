      "The problem is that the RethinkDB cluster doesn't have a centralized system for coordinating table creation. When you instruct a RethinkDB server to create a table, whichever server receives the request will first check if it knows about any table with that name; then create a new table; then tell the other servers about the new table it's created. So if you send two `r.table_create()` queries in quick succession to two different servers, there will be a race condition, and it's possible that each one will create a table. If this happens, you'll see an issue in the web UI telling you that there are two tables with the same name and asking you to rename one of them.\r\n\r\nWe might eventually solve this problem by using a consensus algorithm like Raft or Paxos to manage table creation, but that would be a pretty big change."
