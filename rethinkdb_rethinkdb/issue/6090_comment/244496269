      "@danielmewes's and my testing concluded that we do not need this dependency to be explicitly marked, since this is now part of the stdlib in Ruby. Ignoring the dependency and removing it from runtime has tested as working, so we are removing this line.\r\n\r\nThis is in `next` with 17ec8876 and `v2.3.x` with 0df55924."
