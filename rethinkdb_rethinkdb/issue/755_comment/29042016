      "I guess @coffeemug's point is that a lot of analysis tools are readily available for tools like gprof.\r\nIf we could generate for example ReQL output from our own memory profiler similar to the coro profiler, that could be an alternative.\r\nHowever I don't think it would be any easier than implementing the coroutines as threads."
