      "I was thinking we would just replace tcmalloc with a wrapper that takes a backtrace and keeps track of how much memory different addresses have allocated.  Afterward we can post-process this to get a list of which functions have allocated how much memory.\r\n\r\nWe have backtraces on our coroutines now, so we can do this correctly."
