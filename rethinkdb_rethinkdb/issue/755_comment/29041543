      "@coffeemug -- I'm not 100% sure what you mean by \"lifecycles of objects\", but if we were keeping track of allocations and deallocations it would be easy to ask questions like \"what objects were allocated after this point in time, from these functions, and weren't de-allocated at this point in time\".  Slow, but easy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if Daniel thinks the coroutines/threads thing will be easier and more effective, I'm all for it."
