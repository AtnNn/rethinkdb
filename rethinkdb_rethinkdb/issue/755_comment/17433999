      "Ok, good news is that I got Massif + massif visualization tools working. We now have a graph and everything. The bad news is that these tools are fairly limited. In particular, you can't see a diff between snapshots (not without writing custom scripts) which is arguably something we'd need the most, as it would be an incredibly useful tool.\r\n\r\nI'll continue working on OS X Instruments."
