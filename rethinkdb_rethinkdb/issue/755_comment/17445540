      "Technically we wouldn't even have to parse Massif's text files -- others have already done the work (e.g. https://github.com/MathieuTurcotte/msparser)\r\n\r\nHowever, Instruments is so good, it might be worth it. Want to correlate disk writes, memory allocation, page cache churn over time? Drill down into the data, change intervals, zoom in and out on the fly, plot graphs? Instruments can do that (it's really *that* good). It might be overkill for us and we'll likely get what we want with Massif for now, but I'll see what we can do to get Instruments to work (I've been playing with it all day and I *really* like it)."
