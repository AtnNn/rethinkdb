      "@neumino -- I'd rather not do that for just one driver in a point release.  If we add `r.opts` (or some other solution to the problem), it should be in all the drivers, and I have a mild preference for doing it in a feature release since it's a change to the language.\r\n\r\nFor `between`, we currently don't allow objects as keys, so if the last argument is an object we know it's the optargs.  (At least that's how the logic is implemented in the Ruby driver.)  When we do allow objects as keys, we'll have to add something like `r.opts`.)"
