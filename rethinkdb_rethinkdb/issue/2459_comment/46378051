      "Oh, sorry my mistake, I thought primary keys to be object (besides pseudo types).\r\n\r\n\r\n@coffeemug -- Looking at the methods that take an optarg and strictly more than one argument, I'll stick with your solution:\r\nIf there are enough arguments to allow an optarg, I'll treat the last argument as an optarg if it's a JavaScript object.\r\n\r\nThat way people can force the last argument to be treated as an argument and not an optarg, by wrapping it in `r.expr`, or by adding an empty object at the end.\r\n\r\nThat's a little annoying to do, but it should work.\r\nThe \"only thing\" I have to do, is to look inside r.args how many arguments there are."
