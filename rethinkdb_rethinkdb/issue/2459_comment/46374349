      "I think adding new terms/commands to point releases is a bad idea unless there extenuating circumstances -- we'll end up rushing the proposal, possibly screwing it up, changing the API on people, etc. It's particularly dangerous with something like `r.options` because it might force people to change *a lot* of code, which is something we've tried really hard not to do across point releases.\r\n\r\nI think that we should take a shortcut for now -- for example, only allow one `r.args` and if the user passed `r.args` and a second argument, always enforce the second argument to be an optarg (i.e. make `between(r.args([{a: 1}]), {a: 2})` always pass `{a: 2}` as an optarg). Would you be ok with that?"
