      "I think we should make that work (it works in the Ruby driver).  The way the Ruby driver does it is that for functions which support optional arguments, it looks at the last argument and if it's an object treats it as optional arguments.  (This is unambiguous because `slice` only takes numbers.)\r\n\r\nLong-term, yeah, if we want to let people use objects as keys we need to change the syntax."
