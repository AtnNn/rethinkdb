      "For those watching this issue, this almost certainly won't happen until Rethink hits 2.0 -- sorry. The workaround above should be sufficient for most use cases, and unfortunately there are much more important things we have to do first. If you run into a use case where this is a real showstopper, please let us know and we'll see if we can reprioritize."
