      "What's the exact version of RethinkDB you're running?  (It should print it out when you start up the server.)  If we have that, we can get a symbolic backtrace from the log message, which should go a long way toward hunting this down.  Also, if it dumped a core file anywhere, that would be tremendously helpful.\r\n\r\nJust to be sure, could you check how much memory your system has free around when RethinkDB goes down?  We've had a few crashes like this caused by the system simply running out of memory.  (RethinkDB is, unfortunately, a bit of a memory hog at the moment.)"
