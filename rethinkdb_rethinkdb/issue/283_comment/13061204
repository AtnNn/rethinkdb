      "If you could log memory usage every few seconds so that we can see what it was just before the server goes down, that would be a big help.  I think there's at least a 50-50 chance that the machine is just running out of memory.\r\n\r\nIf it isn't memory, enabling core dumps (`ulimit -c unlimited`) and sending us the core file would also be a big help.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for all the trouble!  I wish I could promise that we'll get this resolved immediately, but if it isn't a simple memory problem it might take a while to isolate.  If it does turn out to be memory exhaustion, either sending fewer queries or running it in a beefier VM should solve the problem.\r\n\r\n@atnnn -- do we have a good way to do automatic restarts right now?"
