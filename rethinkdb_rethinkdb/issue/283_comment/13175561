      "Ok, a few notes on this:\r\n\r\n1. We currently don't provide any tools to automatically restart the process on crash, so it's up to the admin. I believe linux has pretty good tools to make this happen (daemon tools?)\r\n2. Unfortunately the limited core file isn't very useful so we'd have to wait for the full one. Also, vmstat output during the crash would be immensely helpful. I agree with @mlucy that there is a pretty good chance this is an out of memory error.\r\n3. Do you have a sense for which queries you were running during the crash and what the data in the database looked like? (i.e. how much data, how many tables, what did the queries do, etc.) Some analytics-style queries aren't currently very efficient (e.g. see #159), and working with multiple large tables is currently difficult because they don't share cache memory (see #97). It would be very helpful to know what specifically you were doing on the server to try and narrow things down.\r\n\r\nWe're in the middle of shipping 1.4 so I apologize for the delay in responding -- things are a little hectic and it's difficult to juggle everything. Unfortunately we can't do much here without more info, but if you can reproduce the crash, we'll definitely work with you to get to the bottom of this!"
