      "Thanks @charl. I'll still reopen this issue so we can look at it, just in case we can gleam some information. (If someone looks at it and decides there is nothing to be done here, please feel free to close this).\r\n\r\nAlso, we would appreciate any additional feedback on the product, both big and small. Feel free to post here, or shoot me an e-mail at slava@rethinkdb.com. It would help us improve things immensely. Sorry you ran into too many issues -- unfortunately it is still a few months too early for production use."
