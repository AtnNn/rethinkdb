      "Thanks, to everyone behind this product.\r\n\r\nAs the product currently stands I cannot use it in production and I have started shifting my efforts elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs such you should most likely rather focus on the 1.4 release as it may address a lot of the issues I've logged already.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all the help and good luck to you guys. You're onto a winner!"
