      "@coffeemug, I just saw this thread. I did review this, and I wasn't under the impression that we had a flow set in stone -- adding a tick as it completed each stage seemed reasonable to me, as part of the refactor.\r\n\r\nHowever, what you and @danielmewes have laid out makes complete sense, if the meaning of the green tick is that the process has completed in entirety, I'm on board with that."
