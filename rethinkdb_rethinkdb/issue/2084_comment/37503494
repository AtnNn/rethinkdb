      "So the flow is\r\n- Empty progress bar - Started - Green tick\r\n- Progress bar \"in progress\" - Processing - No tick\r\n- Progress bar full - Processed - Green tick\r\n- The progress bar is replaced with \"Ready to use\"\r\n\r\nThe first tick comes from the fact that we use the same code as for replicas (but for replicas, we have two lines and two \"statuses\"). I should probably remove the first green tick.\r\n\r\nThe second tick seems good to me. When the progress bar hit 100%, the index is available.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the stage \"started\", there are two reasons behind it:\r\n- We need it to delay `indexStatus` to have a more precise estimation of the progress (we wait a little before calling `indexStatus` that way we have a better idea of how many blocks we have to process)\r\n- It feels better (at least for replication).\r\n\r\n"
