      "We had an painstakingly designed flow for this, the relevant issue is #1614 (though it doesn't have much information written down).\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure the flow was suppose to go like this:\r\n\r\n* Show an empty progress bar and the word \"starting\"\r\n* Start filling the progress bar and show the word \"processing\"\r\n* When everything is done (i.e. the progress bar hits 100%) replace the word \"processing\" with a green tick\r\n* After some timeout (I think it was a second or so), hide the whole thing\r\n\r\nAlso, I was under the impression that later on, for available indexes, we decided to say something like \"available\" underneath in gray, though it's possible that we never implemented that. @neumino -- do you remember? (in any case, it's a separate issue)\r\n\r\nWe should definitely fix the flow IMO. I'm also a bit concerned that it broke down -- it definitely used to work right. I'd like to understand the reason for this bug so things like it don't creep in later. @mglukhovsky -- you were the reviewer for this code. Could you also comment here?\r\n\r\n"
