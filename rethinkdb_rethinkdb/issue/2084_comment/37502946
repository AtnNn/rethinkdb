      "@danielmewes -- I'm not sure if I'm processing what you're saying correctly, but I *think* we agree.\r\n\r\nBasically, I'm of the opinion that the green tick should appear only at the *very* end, when the index is available and can be used (and when the progress bar is at 100%), it should replace whatever word showed up before it, and should stay for a second or so before the whole thing goes away.\r\n\r\nEDIT: that was the original design too, FYI."
