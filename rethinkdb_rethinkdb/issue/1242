        "I'm opening a new issue for this to help with discussion.\r\n\r\nBasically, the question is how to return dates to users in the clients.  Here's what I think would be a good idea after talking to Slava and Bill:\r\n\r\n* By default, time pseudotypes get turned into native time objects, and we discard any information that isn't representable in native form.  This kinda sucks, but it's what people want 99% of the time.\r\n  - We either overload the `to_json` method on these objects or return a subclass of the native time class that JSON serialization is specialized on so that if people get a row from the DB, serialize it to JSON, deserialize it, and insert it back in, they get the same thing they got out.\r\n* We have a flag that lets people turn this off and instead get back raw pseudotype objects.\r\n  - I think this should be a global setting that you can override with a flag to `run`.  E.g. you could write `r.use_time_format('native')` or `r(...).run(:time_format => 'raw')`, with the latter overriding the former.\r\n  - We may also want to allow other formats, like milliseconds since epoch in UTC, just for convenience.\r\n* We automatically convert native datetime types to ReQL time objects when people put them in queries (basically `r.expr` will handle them).  This one is pretty uncontroversial.\r\n\r\nThis sucks, but everything else sucks more.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug , @wmrowan -- any comments?\r\n\r\nedited by @srh: here's a link to the Dates proposal: #977"
