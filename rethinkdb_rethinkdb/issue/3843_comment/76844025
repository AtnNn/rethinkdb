      "Interesting benchmarks @neumino .\r\nUsing `r.json` definitely makes the server use less resources, but as you've shown that might be offset by higher costs on the client.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like we need to give this more consideration. In the meantime we can tell users who deal with large nested documents to use `r.json(JSON.stringify(doc))` or something equivalent to that in their respective language.\r\n\r\nOnce we fix https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2900 the problem will hopefully go away."
