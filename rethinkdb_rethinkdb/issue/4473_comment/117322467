      "@mlucy Bumping the free stack limit to 8 KB sounds like a good idea. Would you mind checking if that also fixes it on OS X? If it does I think that's good enough. This should be a pretty rare case.\r\n\r\n@mike-thompson-day8 Generally ReQL isn't currently designed to allow users to execute their own queries directly without an intermediate layer. There are loads of ways to write queries that use arbitrary amounts of resources (memory, CPU) or even crash the server by exhausting memory (like in this case). We're trying to detect an increasing amount of cases like this and fail gracefully instead of terminating the server, but it will be a while until we can control all types of resource usage that might be caused by queries."
