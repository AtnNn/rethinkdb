      "Hi @thaiat, right now this is the expected behavior. In the 2.2 release (the one after next), we'll be adding the [return_initial](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3579) option, which will give you better control over this.\r\n\r\nClosing as a duplicate of #3579, but feel free to ask more questions here if you need more explanation"
