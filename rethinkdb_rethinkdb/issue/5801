        "On Win 7 64-bit using the Python drivers, parsing of datetime objects fails if the epoch_time is less than 43200 seconds before 1970. This stackoverflow question details how to produce the error outside of rethink: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37494983/python-fromtimestamp-oserror](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37494983/python-fromtimestamp-oserror)\nThe relevant code is convert_time in ReQLDecoder of ast.py. The issue is clearly an OS/Python problem, but this is a serious detriment for Win users. Perhaps explore other means of parsing dates?\n"
