      "Since #604, we were replacing all arrays (including nested ones) with an ArrayResults object.\r\n\r\nNow we just extend the internal prototype of an array with method of IterableResults and ArrayResult.\r\nWe also just do it if the main results is an array -- We don't do it for nested arrays.\r\n\r\nCode review 466.\r\nBranch michel_731_internals_jsdriver\r\n\r\nNote: We already use the internal prototype in TermBase, so it's fine to reuse it."
