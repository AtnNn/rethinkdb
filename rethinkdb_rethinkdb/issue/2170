        "In a table with 100 documents with two fields (`id` and `field` -- `field` is set to 0 or 10)\n\n```\nr.db('test').table('test').indexDrop('field');\nr.db('test').table('test').indexCreate('field');\nr.db('test').table('test').indexWait('field');\n```\n\nTakes 10 seconds to complete on 1.12 while it takes 2ms on 1.11.\n\nThe data explorer execute the queries in a synchronous way.\nHowever, if I drop, create the index, and then paste the query with `indexWait` (so leaving something like 1 second between the queries), `indexWait` immediatly returns.\n\nAlso, it seems to always take 10 seconds even if I add more documents.\n\nPutting in 1.12.x\n\nNot sure to who this issue belongs to, but I guess @danielmewes it's yours. Feel free to reassign the issue if I'm wrong.\n"
