      "The difference in performance might stem from whether all data fits into RethinkDB's cache or not. If not, RethinkDB has to load each matching document from disk which is multiple orders of magnitude slower than reading it from the cache.\r\n\r\nThis will eventually become efficient with https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3949 , but I'm not sure if there's much you can do right now.\r\n\r\nIs this a significant limitation you're running into in production?"
