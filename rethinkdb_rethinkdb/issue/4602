        "Building is failing on the MacOS public beta of El Capitan specifically in building `v8`. After some troubleshooting between myself and @AtnNn we have narrowed it down to `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` no longer being supported. It seems that they have decided that that is a security risk, and so no longer allow it if \"rootless\" is enabled (it is by default).\r\n\r\nWe are going to need to change how we build `v8` in order to fix this if we expect to continue to build on MacOS. The current trick is to use the `use_system_icu=1` flag to `v8`s build system, with a `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` before it so that the \"system\" version is the one we have built. The `v8` process has to use the `icu` library to build what it needs, so the trouble we run into is in executing that binary without having it in the path.\r\n\r\nRather than using this trick I think we are going to have to switch to `v8`s more supported method of using an external `icu`:`gyp` files (Google's build configuration system). If we are not fetching `icu` then we would still add the `use_system_icu=1` flag, but if we are building `icu` ourselves then we should use `icu_gyp_path` as [documented here](https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/wiki/I18NSupport.wiki?r=16773)."
