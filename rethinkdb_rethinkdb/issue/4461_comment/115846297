      "After thinking a bit about this, here's my proposal for the new panels. Each would have 3 numbers:\r\n\r\n- Servers panel\r\n  - # of servers connected (server_status.count())\r\n  - # of servers unassigned (servers_connected set_diff table_config.replicas.distinct)\r\n  - # of servers missing (table_config.replicas.distinct set_diff servers_connected)\r\n    - Add a '+' to the number if any tables in table_stats has no connected replicas\r\n    - servers assigned and missing has a minimum of 1 if any table\r\n      is down because all of its replicas are gone\r\n- Tables panel\r\n  - # of tables \"ready\"\r\n  - # of tables \"reduced\" (write_only, read_only, outdated_read_only)\r\n  - # of tables \"unavailable\" (outdated_read_only == false)\r\n- Indexes panel\r\n  - total # of secondary indexes\r\n  - # of secondary indexes rebuilding\r\n  - # of outdated indexes\r\n- Connections panel\r\n  - # of client connections\r\n  - # of active connections\r\n  - # of queries per second\r\n\r\nThis invents two new terms \"servers assigned\" for servers that have tables assigned to them, and \"servers missing\" which are assigned servers that are not currently connected."
