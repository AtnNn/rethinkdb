      "@srh That's not true. The NUMA problem is not about losing 10% of the available memory. Not even 50%. If you have 4 NUMA nodes on your machine for example and allocate most of your memory on just one of them, you will not be able to use a full 75% of your machine's memory! Instead it will go into swap and become unusable.\r\n\r\n(Edit: I should add that my understanding of this is based mostly on http://blog.jcole.us/2010/09/28/mysql-swap-insanity-and-the-numa-architecture/ . Maybe some of the space from other nodes will be used eventually, but it seems to be enough of an issue that MongoDB for example prints a big fat warning if you run it on a NUMA system without numactl.)"
