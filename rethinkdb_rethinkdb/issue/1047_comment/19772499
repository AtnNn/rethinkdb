      "That is a wonderfully clever error case. The issue is, once again, with closure. It declares modules in the global namespace since it was designed for the browser. Since different versions of the driver still conflict on this module path closure complains that you're trying to load the same library twice.\r\n\r\n@guillaumervls is this something you're running into in production or is this just a clever idea you had? We've been wanting to remove closure for a long time now and may be prioritizing this soon."
