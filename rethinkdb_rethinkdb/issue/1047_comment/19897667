      "Thanks for your reply!\nFor me it's ok for now since I actually own the other module that uses rethinkdb. I've set it to always use the latest version of rethinkdb (it's a small module, using only basic features of rethink so it shouldn't break soon). So it's in fact only required once. So it works. But since you guys are frequently releasing updates and rethink gets popularity I guess that we'll see more and more modules using rethinkdb. So maybe you might want to remove closure soon if that's not to much work..."
