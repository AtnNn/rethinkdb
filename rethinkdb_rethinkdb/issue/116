        "A few people mentioned a security issue we currently have.\n1. We need to allow turning off http server completely via command line args (e.g. instead of port, pass `none`)\n2. For `init.d` scripts, it's a very bad idea to have the whole thing available on the network by default (many systems don't block 8080 by default). Our example `init.d` file should have the web server turned off by default.\n\nEDIT: the obvious workaround for now, is for people to set up their own firewall or change the port to a high number that's firewalled by default.\n"
