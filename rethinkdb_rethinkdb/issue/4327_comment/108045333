      "I think you're just connecting to the wrong port.\r\nThere is a client port and a cluster port. The cluster port (29015 by default) is used for connecting multiple RethinkDB servers with each other. The client port (28015 by default) is for client connections.\r\n\r\nSo I think you just need to change `port: 29015` to `port: 28015`."
