      "> if the version of rethink on AWS is different from the version of my rethinkdb node package module on heroku, could that cause a problem?\r\n\r\nThat shouldn't cause the error that you mentioned.\r\n\r\nIs there a way you could get the RethinkDB server log from the AWS instance? I suspect that it will be in `/var/lib/rethinkdb/default/log_file` or similar."
