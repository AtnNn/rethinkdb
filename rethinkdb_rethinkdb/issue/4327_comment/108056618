If you start RethinkDB from the command line, you can pass `--bind <address>` to bind to a given interface, or `--bind all` to bind to all interfaces (dangerous unless you have a well configured firewall).\r\nIf you start RethinkDB through the init script on Linux, you can add a line `bind=<address>` to your RethinkDB instance configuration file in `/etc/rethinkdb/instances.d`.\r\n\r\nAre you actually running OS X in AWS?"
