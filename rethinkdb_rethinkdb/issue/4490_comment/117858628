      "Currently it would not be possible since we run things through the PyYAML so don't have access to the original line numbers. But I have a good chunk of our own variation of a yaml-like parser already written, and it would not be too difficult for it to keep the line numbers of the items it parses out for us.\r\n\r\nI don't have a bug for that effort at the moment, but am grabbing this to remind me to do that then.\r\n\r\nUsually I ignore the case count (unless it is really small), and grep for either the expected or test text (not always perfect since some things get translated)."
