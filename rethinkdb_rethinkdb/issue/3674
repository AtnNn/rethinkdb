        "I was testing our new 1.16 web UI on IE 11 and ran into this odd behavior:\n\nThe first time I went to the web UI, the tables as well as the servers list were stuck in the loading state for several seconds before anything appeared.\n\nSince then it has been working fine (i.e. results appear almost immediately) everytime I go to the web UI, even after restarting the browser.\n\nI've once been able to get the slow loading again by cleaning the browser cache and using private mode, but it's not consistent.\n\nUnfortunately this is pretty tricky to reproduce.\nIt's also not very severe since the data eventually appears and from then on everything seems to be working fine.\nIt might hint towards some race condition while loading though.\n"
