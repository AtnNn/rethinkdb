      "The Ruby client does send the numbers to the server in the example he gave, where they're converted to a double.  A double seems to be able to hold this particular value accurately:\r\n```c\r\nprintf(\"%lf\\n\", (double)267932277667934208LLU);                                       \r\n// => 267932277667934208.000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think the error is somewhere in javascript-land."
