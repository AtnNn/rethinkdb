      "Javascript uses double precision arithmetic, which means that not all integers greater than 2 to the 53rd power can be exactly represented.  The numeric literals in the example above get converted to the nearest double precision representation before any Javascript code can touch them.\r\n\r\nIf there is a bug here, it's in our Ruby drivers."
