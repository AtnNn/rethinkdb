      "For the latter problem, could you open another bug report with a minimal example and explain the expected behavior and observed behavior in the current and previous versions of the server?\r\n\r\nNow onto the original problem. Firstly, could you explain what you mean by \"I didn't see any result of the filter query [...] The server didn't stop this time\"? It would really help to see answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n* Did the query return an empty resultset, or did it never return?\r\n* How long did you run it for?\r\n* How long did you have to run it for in the old version of the product?\r\n* How long did you run it for in the Data Explorer? (and could you paste the relevant Data Explorer/JS query here?)"
