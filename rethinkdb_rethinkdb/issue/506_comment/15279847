      "@nuin -- this was shipped today in RethinkDB 1.4.1 (available at http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/, see notes: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/NOTES). If you use Homebrew, we're still waiting for the update to be accepted by them (https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/18653), but it should be available soon.\r\n\r\nIf you could report back on whether this solved your problem, it would be immensely helpful."
