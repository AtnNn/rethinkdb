      "@nuin -- that makes complete sense. We changed the API between 1.3 and 1.4 (the API is relatively stable now, but there may be some more minor changes until Rethink reached 2.0). The fact that it wasn't clearly documented is entirely our fault, I'm just interested in discovering what the issues were so that we could document them more clearly for other users.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue since there isn't anything left to be done, but if you post something on the other error, it would be extremely helpful!"
