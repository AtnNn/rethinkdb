      "Assigning to @mlucy, we'll take a look at it ASAP. This looks like a public dataset, is there a place we can download it from to make reproducing the bug easier?\r\n\r\nOn a different note, if you create a table with `geneid` as a primary key, you can just query by `geneid` using the `get` command which performs much faster. (Look at the primary key option to `tableCreate` -- rethinkdb.com/api) (EDIT -- just an FYI)"
