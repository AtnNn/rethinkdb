      "@nuin -- could you paste the example query that you used on the python command line that used to return a list but now returns a dict? (it would really help us clarify the docs)\r\n\r\nAlso, I understand you picked Mongo for this project, but if you could submit a minimal bug report with the other issue, it would be really helpful (as of now, it isn't clear what specifically the expected and observed behavior is).\r\n\r\nIf you decide to spend a little more time to give us this information, it would be immensely helpful to make RethinkDB better."
