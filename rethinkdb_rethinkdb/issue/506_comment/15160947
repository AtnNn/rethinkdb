      "We have two timeouts.\r\n\r\nOne if defined by the web interface. If every 10 seconds I cannot retrieve the content of `/ajax` the interface reports as being disconnected from the server.\r\n\r\nThe second one is the timeout of the http connection established by the JS driver (which is about as you said 5 minutes).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat happends for @nuin case is probably that:\r\n- He fires a query that for an unknwon reason requires a lot of resource from the server (here's the problem)\r\n- The server being busy, doesn't answer the request done to `/ajax`\r\n- After 10 seconds of waiting, the web interface reports the user that it's disconnected\r\n- When the query is done and the http server available again, the web interface will reload everything (and therefore forget the previous query/results).\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: When I'm talking about the http server, I'm refering to the http server that is going to server the `/ajax`, `/ajax/semilattice` etc. files."
