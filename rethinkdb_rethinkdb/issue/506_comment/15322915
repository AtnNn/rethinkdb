      "@coffeemug Answering your questions:\r\n\r\n- The query return was empty and I was expecting at least one item returned.\r\n- The run time was fast. No problems encountered on running the script.\r\n- Both versions have a similar runtime. I haven't measured but both seem identical and fast (now that is it was fixed).\r\n- On the Data Explorer the runtime was fasta too, no problems on the server.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.db('uniprot').table('proteins_genes').filter({'gene_name':'SMN1'})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis returns on item in the Data Explorer (correctly), but it does not return one on the script. Apparently, by other reports it's a problem on my part. I will double check what I have and report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
