      "Ah, I see, that makes sense, thank you!\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you run a python query to look up the gene directly (instead of as part of your script)? If that works, you could try to narrow it down by removing things from the script until you stumble onto what's wrong. It's a little difficult for us to troubleshoot because there's little specific to go on.\r\n\r\nThanks for your reports and being patient, and sorry you're running into these issues!"
