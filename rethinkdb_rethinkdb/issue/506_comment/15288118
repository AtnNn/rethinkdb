      "Just installed with the DMG. I run the same python code from before, I didn't see any result of the filter query, and I was expecting at least one from the IDs I submitted. The server didn't stop this time.\r\n\r\nRunning the same query from the data explorer was successful and for the couple of IDs I tested I got an item returned.\r\n\r\nI tried upgrading the python driver via pip but it says I have the latest version."
