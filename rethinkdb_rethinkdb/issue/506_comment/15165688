      "Hi\r\n\r\n\"I'm a little confused what you mean by \"Running the python script I can see the loop where I am filtering some items progressing while no result is returner.\". Could you explain what happens when you run the query in Python in more detail?\"\r\n\r\nOn the last version everything was immediate, items were returned quite fast. This time with identical input files, there was no output from my script after a couple of minutes. I had for IDs I was looking for and added just a print statement on the loop that handles the filtering just to see if it was a problems before reaching the loop. I could see the print every time it looped, but strangely, for me, nothing was returned. I tried a second time and had the dashboard side-by-side just to see if there any reads logged on the graph, but the server gave me the disconnected warning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
