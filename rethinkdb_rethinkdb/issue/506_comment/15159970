      "The data explorer can handle queries that last as long as you want.\r\n\r\nThe problems come from the http server. The request to `/ajax` to get the state of the server times out. (see #237). Since we don't get any response from the server, we consider that the server is not available and disconnect the interface from the server.\r\nI can temporary address this issue now by removing the time limit (currently set to 10 seconds) if needed."
