      "Hi @nuin!  Thanks for the bug report.\r\n\r\nI'm a little confused what you mean by \"Running the python script I can see the loop where I am filtering some items progressing while no result is returner.\".  Could you explain what happens when you run the query in Python in more detail?\r\n\r\nThe data explorer times out if a query takes more than some number of minutes (I forget the number off the top of my head), so if the query takes a long time then disconnecting is reasonable behavior.  The page refreshing and the command disappearing from the text box seem less reasonable to me -- @neumino , is this expected behavior?\r\n\r\nIt looks like we have some performance issues in release mode that slipped through the cracks.  We're going to push a fix tomorrow, and there's a good chance that will fix your problem.  If not, we'll get started on trying to reproduce it locally.\r\n\r\nSorry for all the hassle!"
