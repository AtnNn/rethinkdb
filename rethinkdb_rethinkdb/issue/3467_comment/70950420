      "Fix is up in review 2515.  It wasn't actually one for each file, but rather due to the nature of `persist.cc`, it read the file once to get the initial value, then again when updating the value.  The auth metadata migration was not logged.\r\n\r\nChanged to only log the notice once for each file, but to also log the migration of the auth metadata file.  Users should now see:\r\n```\r\nMigrating existing cluster metadata to the new RethinkDB 1.16 format...\r\nMigrating existing auth metadata to the new RethinkDB 1.16 format...\r\n```"
