        "As far as I understand, `r.or(arg1, arg2, ..., argn)` currently returns the first argument that's not `false` or `null`, and `false` otherwise.\n`r.and(arg1, arg2, ..., argn)` returns the last argument if none of them are `false` or `null`, or otherwise the first argument that's either `false` or `null`.\n(@mlucy: Is this correct?)\n\nI think this behavior is more confusing than necessary, and it's not intuitive at least to me what exactly the return value is.\nEspecially confusing:\n- `r.or(null, null) -> false` (note `false` isn't any of the arguments to `or`)\n- but `r.and(null, null) -> null`\n\nEven in less confusing cases, I have to think quite a bit about what the term is going to return for different inputs.\n\nI propose we make `or` and `and` always return a boolean, either `true` or `false`.\n\nThis change would avoid some ambiguity in what we're discussing in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1721#issuecomment-69824399 .\n"
