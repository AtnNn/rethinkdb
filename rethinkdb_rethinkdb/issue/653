This is a problem on Linux, too, because you can't test release builds!\n\nThe second problem:  I moved the build output from `build/debug_clang` to `build/debug` in order to run `run-test.sh`.  Here's what happens:\n\n```\nRunning tests (tasks: 8, repeats: 1, output dir: test_results.czbJY)\nxargs: illegal option -- d\nusage: xargs [-0opt] [-E eofstr] [-I replstr [-R replacements]] [-J replstr]\n             [-L number] [-n number [-x]] [-P maxprocs] [-s size]\n             [utility [argument ...]]\nFailed 115 of 115 tests in 0m1s.\nStored the output of the tests in 'test_results.czbJY'\n```\n"
