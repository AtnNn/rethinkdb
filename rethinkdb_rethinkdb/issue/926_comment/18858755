      "The behavior is the following one\r\n- I get the secondary indexes as soon as you click open the table view\r\n- I'll update the secondary indexes every minute if nothing happens on the interface\r\n- If the user add/delete a secondary index, I'll retrieve the secondary indexes as soon as the operation is done (success or fail)\r\n- If for any reason I cannot retrieve the secondary indexes (table not ready, machine down etc.), I'll try to retrieve the secondary indexes every 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nI'll probably open a code review for that later today."
