Who knows how long it'll take to merge into next, because this is based off of v1.13.x, and because it seems like some people have cherry-picked changes without merging, while other changes look like they might not have been cherry-picked, and it's hard to tell what changes from v1.13.x need to actually be put into next, and which have been overlooked, without resorting to laborious manual inspection."
