      "Branch sam_2563_persist has changes for persist.cc, which are in review 1687.\r\n\r\nIn the short run, other changes related to *on-disk* serialization will be made.  *Intracluster* serialization will still require that every node have the same version (1.14 nodes will refuse to talk to 1.13 nodes) in the short-run.  That's 99% of the benefit with 5% of the effort and more important right now.  I think `cluster_version_t::INTRACLUSTER` will replace some uses of `cluster_version_t::ONLY_VERSION` (so that we can grep for them later) and also be a synonym of `cluster_version_t::LATEST`."
