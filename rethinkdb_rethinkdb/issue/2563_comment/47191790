      "The on-disk serialization now uses serialization versions \"right\" (or so we hope) with code reviews 1687, 1693, 1705, 1706 (1706 is the only one pending).  This is in sam_2563 which is branched off of sam_2573 which is branched off of v1.13.x.\r\n\r\nIt would be appropriate to merge this into v1.13.x if we are going to fix #2579."
