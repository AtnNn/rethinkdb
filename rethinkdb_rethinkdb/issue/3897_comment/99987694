      "For completeness: We decided in #3594 that it would be best to implement the first of the options, i.e. don't keep a permanent record of servers - at least from a user's point of view.\r\n\r\nIt's worth discussing whether we should make an exception for servers that are participating in an otherwise reachable table.\r\nI think it's probably not necessary as far as `server_config` and `server_status` are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe most important piece of information I can think of that we would want to make available to users when a server participating in a table goes missing is its name. This is useful for showing an issue like \"Table ... is missing replica ...\" with the server name rather than having to display the server UUID.\r\n\r\nIf it's easier to implement, I think it would be fine to keep the current metadata and have users delete servers explicitly. We would only need to change that servers can \"undelete\" themselves later. Though even that is probably a relatively rare case, which we could ignore for the first release."
