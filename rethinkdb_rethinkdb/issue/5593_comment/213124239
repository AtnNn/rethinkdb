      "I think @chrisvariety 's explanation is the right one. Doing a single `getAll` with multiple keys is much more efficient than doing multiple `getAll`, one for each key. This is also at the core of our recent optimization to `eqJoin` which we shipped with RethinkDB 2.3.0. Previously `eqJoin` would do individual `getAll`s similar to your first query, while now it's combining multiple join keys into a single `getAll` request internally."
