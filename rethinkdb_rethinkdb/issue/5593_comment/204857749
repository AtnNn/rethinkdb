      "Just a guess and the folks at RethinkDB would know more, but...\r\n\r\nThe first example runs a bunch of separate getAll's, one for each set of posts within each board, and the second just runs two getAll's total.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you want to return _both_ boards _and_ posts or only _posts_. Assuming you want only posts, you can just do this which is roughly equivalent to your second example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table('posts').getAll(r.args(\r\n    r.table('boards').getAll('1233131', {index: 'folders_id'})('id').coerceTo('array')\r\n  ), {index: 'boards_id'})\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will error out if there are zero boards with that id FYI, but so will your second example (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2588 for a workaround)"
