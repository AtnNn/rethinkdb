      "@AtnNn -- thanks!\r\n\r\nThat line is the end of the second `if` statement in `mailbox_cb`, which suggests that it's the `rwlock_in_line_t` destructor causing the problem.  Nothing looks wrong with the logic, though.  We can't get there without, in order:\r\n* Checking that we aren't detached.\r\n* Acquiring a drainer lock.\r\n* Waiting for the queues to be ready.\r\n\r\nThere are no obvious race conditions that we might be falling afoul of.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes -- is it plausible for destroying an `rwlock_in_line_t` to cause that guarantee to trigger?  Can you glean any information from the fact that that guarantee in particular triggered?\r\n\r\n@timjrobinson -- thanks for reporting this!  Is there any chance you have a core dump from the crash?"
