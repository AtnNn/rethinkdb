      "A few additional questions @timjrobinson \r\n- Do you know if any specific query was running when this happened?\r\n- Had you previously reconfigured (a table in) the cluster, or had a different machine been shut down or restarted?\r\n- As @timmaxw mentioned this appears to be related to change feeds. Can you explain a little bit how you are using change feeds in your application? How many do you have open at a time (approximately)? What are the actualy change feed queries you are running?\r\n- Are the tables that you use change feeds on sharded? Are they replicated? If yes, how many shards? How many replicas?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!\r\n\r\nPlease also let us know in case this happens a second time."
