      "What directory should this core file be in on Ubuntu 14.04? I checked /var/lib/rethinkdb/instances.d/db-2, /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d and /usr/bin and it's not in any of those folders. I guess it doesn't work until I do ulimit -c unlimited. \r\n\r\nTo get the core dump working I've done the following:\r\n\r\nLogged in as root then:\r\n```\r\nsu - rethinkdb\r\nulimit -c unlimited \r\nservice rethinkdb restart\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould this be all I need to do?"
