      "I just set up a new database server for testing (~100 documents) and ran into this error.\r\n\r\n* First table: 2 documents\r\n* Second table: ~100 documents\r\n\r\nI added a secondary index to the second table for a field that is available in every document in the table. After a short while (~5-10 minutes) i removed the secondary index because I didn't need it.\r\n\r\nNow, if I try to query the second table, even after restarting RethinkgDB, the database crashes: [See log](https://gist.github.com/janpieper/63f08363ca50eee6adf0).\r\n\r\n__Edit:__\r\n* I am using _RethinkDB 1.10.1-0ubuntu1~precise_ on a _Ubuntu 12.04_ maschine.\r\n* Its reproduceable for me. The error occurs if I delete a (newly added) secondary index."
