      "So the deletion and access happen as part of the same call to `rdb_update_sindexes()`. However they are in different calls to `rdb_update_single_sindex()`, and they operate on different sindex btrees.\r\nSomehow they end up modifying a blob which uses the same blocks.\r\n@jdoliner: Could this have to do with the fact that secondary indexes now contain references to a shared blob structure? Is it legal to modify the secondary index entries for one and the same value in different secondary indexes at the same time?\r\nMight we need some kind of mutex around the part in `rdb_update_single_sindex()` which does the kv_location_set?"
