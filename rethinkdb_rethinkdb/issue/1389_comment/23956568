      "Interesting. I tried to reproduce this issue in a commit from before the sindex optimizations and couldn't get it to reproduce. It could be that it became easier to reproduce because things got faster following the optimizations. Either way seeing as this existed before I agree that we should move this to 1.9.x and ship 1.9.\r\n\r\nI've also concluded that this isn't caused by accessing the contents of a blob after we cleared it by commenting out the place where we clear the blobs (this just leaking them) and observing that it still crashed."
