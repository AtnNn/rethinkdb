        "After importing a 8 million document database with many tables of different sizes most of them needed 3 secondary indexes, When trying to do almost anything on the server or rethinkdb is almost impossible, load average goes between 10-40 on a dual core server. Now i understand that high load for indexing is expected but if the processes that ran the indexing on rethinkdb were set with nice. it would allow other processes to push them aside maybe things like cronjob that normally run on the server, if the main db processes was still with normal linux priority it would mean results will return faster pushing the indexing aside.\r\n\r\nThe reason I bring this up is, as it stands anytime that I would want to build a new index i would need to put the app in to maintenance.
