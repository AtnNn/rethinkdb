      "I like the idea. It's not the same as having native graph support in ReQL (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3142), but it would take away the burden of having to maintain a completely separate database for users who need to handle some graph-structured data in addition to their usual \"native\" RethinkDB data sets.\r\n\r\nPutting this in the `ecosystem` milestone for now."
