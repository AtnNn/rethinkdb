      "Just as a data point, in the elasticsearch river I found myself wanting to know when a new table was added to the database. I don't know how useful the union would be in practice. It makes sense to my theoretical side though.\r\n\r\nIs there a way in real_admin to get a changefeed that will tell you when there's a new table in a given db?"
