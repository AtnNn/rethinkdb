      "What happens is that people try to prototype their queries in the data explorer, and then convert them to the language of their choice (ruby/python). So, having subtly different behavior across drivers results in a lot of confusion. I think the core reql ops should be the same everywhere and done on the server. We can do some operator overloading to make things convenient for people in languages that support it, but I don't want to take it too far (math and logic is great, but things beyond that are too much -- even `nth(x)` is better than `[x]`, though we can support both).\r\n\r\nCoffeescript does the existential operator to a great effect and we should replicate it in ReQL."
