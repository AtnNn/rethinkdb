      "I agree with Joe that having two operators with slightly different meanings might be bad, but I agree with Slava that the new `exists` is probably the behavior people want 95% of the time.\r\n\r\nI think we should seriously consider adopting the convention that `{:a => :b, :c => nil}` is identical to `{:a => :b}`.\r\n\r\nBarring that, we could consider relegating `has_attr` to some sort of \"advanced\" documentation and only presenting new users with `exists`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs an aside, why do you believe people prototype their queries in the data explorer and then convert those queries to their language of choice?  I think most Ruby/Python users are *much* more comfortable in that language than Javascript, and would never think of writing their queries in JS and then porting them.  (I certainly wouldn't.)"
