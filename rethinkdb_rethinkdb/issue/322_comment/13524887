      "> As an aside, why do you believe people prototype their queries in the data explorer and then convert those queries to their language of choice?\r\n\r\nI don't know how common the propensity to do this is, but I've seen both @al3xandru and @mglukhovsky consistently work this way, and I work this way myself. I've also seen others on twitter/irc talk about working this way. I suspect it might become common for people to move away from the data explorer over time as they get more comfortable with the language, but it's certainly a common enough use case among beginners.\r\n\r\nI also think that it's unrealistic to think that a given person will just use one language to access rethink. The whole 'polyglot' business turns out to be a big deal in many places, where the same person maintains two or more pieces of software written in different languages that access the same database.\r\n\r\nAs for `null` being identical to non-existence, it's worth thinking about. Coffeescript basically gives a bunch of sugar to get around the fact that `null` and non-existence are different things in Javascript. I know that people are perfectly happy with how coffeescript works (having two ops -- they understand the concept of existence and attributes intuitively), but it's very plausible that they might be happier with `null` and non-existence being the same thing. @al3xandru, @neumino and @mglukhovsky -- what do you think?"
