      "I'm really not a big fan of the bottom type.\r\nI've spent too much time debugging JavaScript and its NaN value, but what I'm worried about is that users can save the null value and since it can propagate, it's just too easy to delete all your data.\r\n\r\nIt's a far too dangerous feature from my point of view."
