      "> Coffeescript does the existential operator to a great effect and we should replicate it in ReQL.\r\n\r\nBut coffeescript does the existential operator in a single consistent way. Null and undefined are always the same as nonexistence. I can see an argument for not having different behaviors between clients. I'd be fine with doing it exactly like coffeescripts in a single consistent way and acknowledging that for some languages like python this is a slightly different paradigm. I'm just opposed to having both the operators and having them behave differently."
