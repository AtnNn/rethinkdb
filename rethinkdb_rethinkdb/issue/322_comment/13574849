      "1. @coffeemug and @mlucy proposal makes a lot of sense to me.\r\n\r\n2. it doesn't address the scenario where a `null` value is involved in a math operation. In this case there would still be no way to write a query that filters out `nulls`.\r\n\r\n3. what I think we need is: `has_attr(attr_name, not_null=false)` (that basically covers both `contains` and the proposed `exists`).
