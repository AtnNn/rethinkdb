      "> I think we should seriously consider adopting the convention that {:a => :b, :c => nil} is identical to {:a => :b}.\r\n\r\nI'm actually basically neutral on the 2 possible meanings of exists and would be quite happy to adopt this policy, it's a simple rule to understand and it seems like a lot of people use it.\r\n\r\nHaving \"advanced documentation\" for `has_attr` has a bit of a funny smell but whatever. If we say that `null` is identical to nonexistence can we think of a case in which you really need this?"
