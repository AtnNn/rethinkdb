      "I think @mlucy proposal to merge null and undefined would be the best solution from my point of view because\r\n1/ null == undefined anyway in JavaScript.\r\n2/ It would also be a nice syntax to remove an attribute.\r\n3/ If doesn't make sense to save null in a database. The value null is a temporary value for a variable to say that is has not been initialized yet.\r\n\r\nIf we have to keep null and undefined, I think @coffeemug solution with `exists` and `has_attr` is really nice.\r\nWe will just have to tell people to use `exists` in our tutorial/quick starts and have a little doc to clearly explain the difference between the two functions."
