        "User krz on IRC was confused by the fact that\r\ntable().get().update() works, while table().limit(1).nth(0).update() does not.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find a rationale for why nth should destroy the ability to perform an update, and it seems somewhat arbitrary.\r\n\r\nIf it is reasonably easy to implement, I think we should extent nth (and also slice) to directly work on a selection and maintain that type.\r\n\r\nSide note:\r\nThe issue is made worse by the fact that the API documentation is not a great help for this either. It says update works on table, selection and singleSelection. It also says that limit returns a stream for example. It is not possible to easily conclude from that whether limit().update() works or not."
