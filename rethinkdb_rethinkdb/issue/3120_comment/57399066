      "I implemented a server-side sleep function for testing purposes when working on concurrent query evaluation.  One hypothetical use that I could come up with in the last 10 seconds would be if you wanted to rate-limit HTTP requests that are run in a map or foreach.  (That is, if we don't already have that capability.) (I think that specific option should be in r.http if anywhere, though. A sleep ReQL command implies specific evaluation semantics that wouldn't be future-compatible.)"
