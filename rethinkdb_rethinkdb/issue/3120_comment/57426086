      "Thanks for responses.\r\n\r\nIt is needed for simulating server load while testing client applications. As you know, all SQL DBs have this function. Simple wait on client side doesn't give what you want as it's important to see what is happening when too many connections to DB are waiting. \r\n\r\nIf it is not possible, never mind, waiting in \"js\" function is also an option.\r\n\r\nRegards,"
