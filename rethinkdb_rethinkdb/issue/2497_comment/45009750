      "@coffeemug -- the current implementation of feeds (not yet merged in `next`) doesn't use `hasNext`.\r\nI had to to this to have feeds work with empty partial responses.\r\n\r\nFeeds are in a different class than cursor, mostly because while they are a little similar, merging them would mean a lot of `if` statement in the code. The logic used in the cursor is quite tricky and I didn't want to make it harder to read."
