      "@ConceitedCode I may have been silent for a while but I haven't forgotten about this. Issue #1017 is slated for 1.7 (the next release) but is a relatively low priority bug. I need to work on other fixes before I get to this one but this should still make the release. I'll update further if the schedule slips but for now I expect that I'll get back to this some time next week."
