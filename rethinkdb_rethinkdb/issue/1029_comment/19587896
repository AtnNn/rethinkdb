      "@ConceitedCode, it looks like you've addressed 3 different issues in this pull request.\r\n\r\n1. Changed some code to Python 3 style\r\n2. Added a timeout to the client handshake\r\n3. Added type conversion to connect\r\n\r\nWe like to limit the scope of fixes to just one issue so we have the opportunity to reach consensus on each. I'm going to limit the scope of this pull request to just #1017.\r\n\r\nFor a number of reasons we're not yet ready to move the driver to Python 3 (see #44). I know this is frustrating to a lot of users (and a big element of the Python community) but I promise that we do plan on moving to Python 3 eventually.\r\n\r\nCould you open a new issue covering the handshake timeout issue? This could actually be an important bug. Having a separate issue means we can track modifications to all 3 drivers (as well as any potential server changes). For something like this we'll also need to make sure that the expected behavior is thoroughly tested.\r\n\r\nThe test script that you modified is a bit outdated and is not integrated into our automated test suite. Before I can merge this I'll need to add tests for all three drivers and make sure that the fix is consistent across all three. To move forward I'll cherry pick the commit a8ac6cae958c881b22ec0e8b844fc3a01cbdf6e5 into a branch and implement any required tests and / or changes to the other drivers. Once this has gone through our review process I'll merge everything into next and close this pull request. I'll let you know if I need anything more from you but I should be able to take it from here. Thanks for your contribution!"
