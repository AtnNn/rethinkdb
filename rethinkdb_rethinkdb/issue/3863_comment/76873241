      "So we believe that this only happens if another server disconnects in a very narrow time frame after establishing the connection. The error should not happen once the cluster is up and running.\r\n\r\nI'm going to backport https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/3814 to our v1.16.x branch. However unless it turns out that this happens more often than we believe, we will probably wait for the next release (2.0) to ship the fix. The release should be out ~2 weeks from now.\r\n\r\n@jilen if this is critical for you, I can also send you a custom binary with the fix."
