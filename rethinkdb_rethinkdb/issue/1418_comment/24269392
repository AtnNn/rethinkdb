      "We'd be happy to merge it into the README, but we can do a lot more -- add a section under \"deploying\" in http://rethinkdb.com/docs/, promote the service to our audience, etc. Giving our users a good set of deployment options is a high priority for us, so if the service offers production-quality options, we'd love to promote it since it's a huge value add for our users."
