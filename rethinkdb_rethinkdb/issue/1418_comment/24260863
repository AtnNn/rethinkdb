      "Wow, this is really cool. I just played a little and it's really exciting (well, ok, I only really ran `r.expr(1)` in the data explorer, but I know Rethink well enough to guess what it's going to do :))\r\n\r\nIf you're thinking of doing a production-ready version (which would be great, and we'd be happy to help any way we can), considering looking through how we did it for AWS (http://rethinkdb.com/docs/aws/) as that should give you some pointers on security (in case some stuff isn't clear). A couple of tricks we do:\r\n\r\n* Put a reverse proxy in front of the web UI so it isn't publicly accessible\r\n* Let people set an auth key for client drivers\r\n\r\nMulti-instance stuff gets a bit harder, so I'd be happy to brainstorm that as well.\r\n\r\nAwesome work -- thanks for letting us know about it!"
