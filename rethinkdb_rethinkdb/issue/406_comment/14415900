      "This appears to be two servers with different version strings attempting to connect to each other.  Since the version strings are different (i.e. different platforms), it's refusing to connect.  This is actually something that we've changed for 1.4, which should be out soon.  In the new version, we only check the base version, e.g. 1.4.0, as well as arch bitsize - 32bit or 64bit,  and debug vs release builds."
