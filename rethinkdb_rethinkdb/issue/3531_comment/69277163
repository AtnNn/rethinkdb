      "@mlucy The only remaining command I'm aware of that can generate illegal UTF-8 is `split`. Can you think of others?\r\nI think once we are sufficiently sure that there's no way to generate any new illegal UTF-8 string, we are good for the time being and also disallowing existing non-UTF-8 data has a lower priority.\r\n\r\n@gchpaco has a fix for `split` which is just waiting on figuring out some library/linking questions. It will ship with 1.16 or 2.0. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2518"
