      "NoBrainer does its own reconnecting, which is not thread safe judging by the comment in there:\r\nhttps://github.com/nviennot/nobrainer/blob/master/lib/no_brainer/query_runner/reconnect.rb#L15\r\n\r\nI can put a big fat lock whenever the user is going in the NoBrainer query runner pipeline. This is an acceptable solution until you guys figure out the connection pool design (if I understand correctly, the connection pool will implemented in the future?)\r\n\r\nBut I can't have a lock when the user is iterating on `.each`."
