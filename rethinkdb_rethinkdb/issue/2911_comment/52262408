      "I certainly wasn't thinking about thread-safety when I wrote the code for `each`.\r\n\r\nIf you have two cursors on the same connection, and you iterate over cursor A on thread A and cursor B on thread B, and they both go to fetch a new batch at the same time, then I **think** that should be safe in CRuby, but I haven't tested it and wouldn't trust it.  If we want to support that, we should be very explicit about acquiring a lock on the connection and only releasing it while blocking on `send` and `recv`.\r\n\r\nIn any case, iterating over two cursors from the same connection on different threads certainly shouldn't result in the user getting \"SE\" instead of \"SUCCESS\".  (But that should only happen when opening a connection or reconnecting, anyway.)\r\n\r\nI know that calling `reconnect` on the same connection in two different threads can cause errors.\r\n\r\nActually, another question: does nobrainer use `auto_reconnect`?"
