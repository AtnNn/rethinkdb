      "@fuwaneko I'm getting some interesting results while trying to reproduce this problem.\r\n\r\nI copied your code into a file called `test.coffee` and compiled it to `test.js` with `coffee -c test.coffee`. I'm running node v0.10.15 and coffee v1.6.3.\r\n\r\n`$ cat test.coffee | coffee` results in your error\r\n`$ coffee test.coffee` no error\r\n`$ cat test.js | node` no error\r\n`$ node test.js` no error\r\n\r\nThis suggests to me that this problem relates to how coffeescript is parsing and translating your code. If you manually translate your code to JS do you still get the error? Can you provide the code that produces this error from your application?"
