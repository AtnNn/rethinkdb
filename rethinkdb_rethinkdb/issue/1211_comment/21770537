      "I think I've isolated problem. It's related to how CoffeeScript CLI and my code runs. Both CLI and my application are using Node.js VM module to run code. I use it to run plugins in a separated isolated context to minimize risks of crashing or security problems. CoffeeScript uses VM to run commands in interactive mode (and in normal mode it compiles code and spawns Node.js process to run it, which is why it works). However, current VM implementation has some problems, which is why in this code\r\n```\r\nif (perhapsOptDict && ((!(perhapsOptDict instanceof Object)) || (perhapsOptDict instanceof TermBase))) {\r\n  perhapsOptDict = null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```instanceof Object``` will return false regardless. ```typeof perhapsOptDict == \"object\"``` however works correctly."
