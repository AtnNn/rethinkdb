      "V3 is faster, has sound cancellation semantics and a bunch of small improvements. It has warnings (which warn against pitfalls) and other nice things. In all honesty V2 is fine for what you're doing and we intend to keep fixing bugs in it. \r\n\r\nI just wanted to make sure there is nothing stopping you from our side of the API.\r\n\r\nCheers and thanks for Rethink, having a lot of fun with it!"
