        "At least in Python, it seems that the only way for finding out if a given connection object is still open is by trying to run a query through it.\r\nI suggest we add an `is_open()` / `isOpen()` method to the connection types of our drivers.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not to *guarantee* that a subsequent query will go through. On the other hand it should always return `false` if `conn.close()` has been called on the connection before."
