      "I have come to the conclusion that the `SIGKILL` issue is deeply enough embedded into the `./run`/`test_framework.py` code as to be fatal. I have already made `./test-runner` run in parallel without having a similar problem (or complexities) in #2672.\r\n\r\nStarting with that as a building-block I will be making `./test-runner` into an eventual replacement for `./run`. With that in mind I am closing this issue as **wontfix**"
