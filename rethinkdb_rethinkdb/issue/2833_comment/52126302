      "I think I have figured out the main issue here (there are still a few): in `test_framework.py::TestProcess.run()` we swallow `SIGINT`s. This means that the only way our tests can actually be killed is with something stronger (i.e.: `SIGKILL`), that in turns means that none of our cleanup machinery gets to go to work. And since (for good reason) we split off things like the server processes into their own process-groups they never get the signal to quit.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't see a clean/quick solution to this. It is going to require quite a bit of re-working of `test/run`/`test/common/test_framerwork.py`."
