        "When the drivers moved from being totally external Makefiles to being integrated with the main system the `test/build.mk` did not get changed and still uses `make -C` to build those folders. This does not create any large issues, but does mean three things:\r\n1. The two drives a built again every time, even if there is nothing to do\r\n2. Because they are called externally the output does not fit into the rest of the flow we have\r\n3. If there were any MAKE options that affected the building the drivers they would not be brought along (not currently an issue)."
