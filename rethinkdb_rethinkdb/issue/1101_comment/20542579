      "After the fix in #1105, `r.js` became twice as fast, and doesn't slow down anymore on large datasets (which was the original performance culprit). @jdoliner -- would you mind if I close this issue since it no longer seems relevant? We can reopen if `r.js` performance rears its head again. (Moving to backlog for now)."
