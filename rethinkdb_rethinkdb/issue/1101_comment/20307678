      "Also, the fact that `r.js` integrates nicely into every command is a point we can advertise, and when I showed it to people they were blown away by this capability. There are also other reasons for running JS on the server (server-side triggers, for example). Even if people never need to use it, other solutions have it, and people will ask about it (may be for the wrong reasons, but they'll still ask).\r\n\r\nI think we should keep it and make it fast. It's a really neat (and useful) command."
