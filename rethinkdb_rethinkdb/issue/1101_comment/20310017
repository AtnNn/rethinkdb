      "Maybe one thing to think about while doing something with it, is putting a note in the docs that says it's slow and really shouldn't be used inside a filter and it's best used in xyz points in the query. If I saw that the first time around, I probably would have ended up on the google groups much earlier then I did. (I probably spent a good couple hours building the query that I built)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my defense, I did realize that something was up and it shouldn't be that slow. At that point, I came to the google groups where, with help, I actually realized I had bigger problems involving my initial data entry."
