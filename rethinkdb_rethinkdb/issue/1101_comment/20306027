      "People using `r.js` inside of things like `filter` and `map` is generally a bad idea because the time required for the process to process communication is going to be slow enough that it makes the query slow. Slow enough that it's basically unusable. This can leave some users with a bad first impression. In many cases these will be users who in a lot of cases don't actually need to be using `r.js` it's just that coming from a mongo background javascript seems like the go to way to do a lot of things.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of what I'm talking about: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rethinkdb/H3qUhOCRX9g if he hadn't come to google groups he might have just assumed RethinkDB is too slow for his needs.\r\n\r\nWe could maybe make it so you need to pass a flag to iterative commands (`filter`, `map` etc.) to use `r.js` this could be annoying but I actually think that `r.js` is so slow that it's very rare that someone actually wants to use it in those functions."
