      "> What if the flag went to `run` but we only required it if `r.js` were used in a iterative environment?\r\n\r\nThat sounds good to me (there is an argument to be made in favor of consistency, but I think if the error message is clear enough this wouldn't be a problem).\r\n\r\n> The flag sounds like a bad idea to me. We should just write better docs.\r\n\r\nThat sounds like a good option too. :)"
