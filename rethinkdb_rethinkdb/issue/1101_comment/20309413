      "I *believe* that right now `r.js` passes the evaluation context to v8 and gets the value back row-by-row instead of batch-by-batch. This is a *huge* inefficiency. I'm not sure how easy it is to fix, but I can easily see the fix offer an order of magnitude performance improvement (or more).\r\n\r\nI think passing a flag `enable_js` to `run` and printing a \"slow\" error if the user doesn't provide the flag is a good interim solution. I'm opposed to introducing this flag on a per-command basis though, I think if we do it, we should just make it part of `run`."
