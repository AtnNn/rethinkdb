      "I feel like passing a flag to enable `r.js` doesn't really contradict the value of being able to pass it everywhere. And unless we can make `r.js` a lot faster (which I kind of doubt) I really think the cost of bad first impressions and lost interest is a lot higher than the cost of people getting an error message that says: \"This may be slow pass a flag if you want to continue or go to this url to learn about alternatives to r.js\" and then having to pass a flag. It really seems like a very simple thing that could save us a ton of bad first impressions."
