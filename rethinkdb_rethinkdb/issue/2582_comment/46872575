      "Found the bug. I did remove the buffer for Feeds, but then I refactor Cursors and Feeds together, and add back the buffer of one row again.\r\nAnd it looks like all the changes were caught in the tests because I was dropping the table at the end.\r\n\r\nFix in branch michel_2582_hasnext_buffer\r\nReview 1686 assigned to @Tryneus "
