      "These were on `next` (153a96a).  The test framework was recently reworked a bit, and it appears the version in `v2.1.x` deadlocks with this version of the table fuzzer.  Still, I ran the test against `v2.1.x` and could not reproduce the crash.  I'll keep trying, as I've run into other problems."
