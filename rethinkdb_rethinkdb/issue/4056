        "We currently have a non-default destructor in datum_t which makes it non-movable. The destructor is empty, so it looks like we could safely remove it.\r\n\r\nHowever we should audit code that might move datums and make sure that we're not introducing any new bugs by doing so. As a second step we should see if we can move datums more often to avoid some of the atomic reference counting calls that occur when copying a datum."
