        "I am trying to implement a soft-create mechanism. When it comes to index, I wonder how to compare two index definitions to decide whether or not to override. I noticed `indexStatus` returns query and function, but they don't match `[any query].toString()`. I wonder if there is a more direct way to tell if two queries do the same thing."
