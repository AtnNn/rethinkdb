      "Yes it is reliably reproducible on my machine... and grr... not reproducible on `gantz`. So this is probably a timing/race condition issue. Either that, or something is borked on my machine with Ruby2.2 and only shows up in this test.\r\n\r\nI am going to see if a machine that previously repeated timing issues that I saw will also do the same."
