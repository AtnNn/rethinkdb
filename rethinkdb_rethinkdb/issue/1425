        "In issue #1422, user @nu11gravity ran out of memory because his system had a 10 MB default stack size and 256MB of memory, resulting in hitting a resource allocation limit in a pthread_create call since the default I/O pool size is 32.\n\nA workaround is to use `--io-threads` to specify a smaller I/O pool size.\n\nOur blocker pool threads do not need much stack space.  They don't recurse, the deepest we go is when printing a backtrace when a guarantee fails.\n\nThe default stack size on the system I'm using right now is 2 MB.  There's no need for use to spend 64 MB of memory on these I/O pool threads.  We could set a pthread attribute to make their stacks much smaller.  128 KB would be fine, that's what our coroutine stack size is.\n\nedit: working on this in branch sam_1425 off v1.9.x.\n"
