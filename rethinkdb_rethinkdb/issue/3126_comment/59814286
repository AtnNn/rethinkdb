      "@onuradsay just to explain this: `filter` is the same as `getAll`, in the sense that it will simply return an empty stream when there is no match. As a consequence, `update` doesn't get any document and hence it also doesn't skip anything. `get` is different because it doesn't return a stream, but rather emits an explicit `null` if the key doesn't match. That's what makes `update` generate the `skipped: 1`."
