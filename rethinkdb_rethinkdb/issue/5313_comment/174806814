      "> it looks like this might be because this particular server was running a QA test on a usb stick\r\n\r\nThat sounds like the likely cause. Some devices, in particular certain USB drives, might tell the operating system that some data has been written even though it hasn't actually been fully persisted.\r\nIn the case of RethinkDB, this can sometimes lead to data file corruption, like in this case.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this. But if anything like this happens again on a \"proper\" disk, please let us know."
