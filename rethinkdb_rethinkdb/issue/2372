        "Right now, if I build up a query, and then log its value, it's almost but not quite something I can put into the data explorer (or somewhere else in my code, etc.).\r\n\r\nEx: This works fine.\r\n```\r\nfibrous-coffee> q= r.db(\"test\").table(\"sometable\").get('xyz') `\r\nfibrous-coffee> q.toString()\r\n'r.db(\"test\").table(\"sometable\").get(\"xyz\")'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut here is an example that is a little bit off.\r\n```\r\nfibrous-coffee> r.expr({'-x-y-z':2}).toString()\r\n'{-x-y-z: 2}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if it's toString were:\r\n`r.expr({\"1\": \"2\")` or something like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n`r.expr` is the main thing I've noticed that doesn't match up.\r\n(1) The `r.expr()` wrapping gets dropped\r\n(2) the quoting of keys in objects gets lost\r\n\r\nThere may be other places where this doesn't work that I haven't noticed yet. It would be super nice for a number of reasons if the .toString() was always guaranteed to be a valid query. I think it should be possible to do so.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is a dupe -- I couldn't find an easy way to search through old issues."
