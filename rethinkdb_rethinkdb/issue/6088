        "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI'm having an issue with AWS Lambda who got timeout without explicit reason when trying to connect to an EC2 RethinkDB instance. \r\n\r\nI don't know if someone else get the error or having the same case. I didn't find something about it. \r\n\r\n`{ [ReqlTimeoutError: Could not connect to MY-ELASTIC-IP:28015, operation timed out.] name: 'ReqlTimeoutError', msg: 'Could not connect to MY-ELASTIC-IP:28015, operation timed out.', frames: undefined, message: 'Could not connect to MY-ELASTIC-IP:28015, operation timed out.' }`\r\n\r\nThe only way to fix this problem during a random duration is to re-upload the lambda function who failed until the next timeout... \r\n\r\nI hope to find a solution for this \128516 "
