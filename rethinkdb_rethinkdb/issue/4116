        "I inserted 20k documents into the database. When we return a huge document, we turn off DOM formatting (collapsible fields, etc.) to speed up rendering. However I noticed two problems.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the left brace `{` (or in case of arrays the left bracket `[`) is indented when it shouldn't be. Here are two example screenshots:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2015-04-24 at 10 19 19 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/48436/7324521/fa6f5662-ea6b-11e4-9a0d-98b9855cfde7.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2015-04-24 at 10 20 12 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/48436/7324525/01065dea-ea6c-11e4-81a3-6a2b3bb28069.png)\r\n\r\nSecondly, we used to show an infobox on top saying that we've turned off formatting because the document is big and we want to speed up browser rendering. This message no longer appears, but should.\r\n\r\n/cc @deontologician "
