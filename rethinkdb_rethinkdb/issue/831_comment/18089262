      "This bug looks straightforward to fix.  `table_t::batch_replace` is locally responsible for the empty vector that it passes to the `batched_replaces_t` constructor.  This happened when running the defunct Ruby test because it produced a bunch of invalid queries somehow.\r\n\r\nI'm going to check every place we call the `batch_replaces_t` constructor to make sure that we can't pass to it an empty vector in any of those places.\r\n\r\nI will also run the defunct Ruby tests to see if they can flush out any other bugs.\r\n\r\nWe also need a regression test for this bug."
