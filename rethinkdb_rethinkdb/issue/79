        "`reql-api.json` already contains almost everything necessary to generate unit tests (other than initialization fixtures and expected output). It shouldn't be too difficult to automatically generate unit tests from it to augment existing driver unit tests. This isn't a high priority now, but is a nice fun project when we get the chance to do it."
