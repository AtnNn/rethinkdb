        "Often I copy rethinkdb binaries to other locations and get an error complaining that the directory rethinkdb_web_assets doesn't exist when I run rethinkdb.\r\n\r\nNaturally, I then say, \"oh well, I don't want to use the web interface anyway, I'll just pass --no-http-admin\" but I still get the error! Funnily enough, I can defeat this check just by creating an empty directory called rethinkdb_web_assets which works even when I don't pass --no-http-admin! This is silly. We should just disable to check when the flag is passed."
