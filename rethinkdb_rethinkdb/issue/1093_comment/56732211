      "The `xxd` tool may be useful:\r\n```\r\n$ echo \"Hello, World!\" > hello\r\n$ xxd -i hello\r\nunsigned char hello[] = {\r\n  0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x2c, 0x20, 0x57, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x6c, 0x64,\r\n  0x21, 0x0a\r\n};\r\nunsigned int hello_len = 14;\r\n```\r\nBut it seems like an incomplete solution. At the very least we would also need to construct a file lookup table."
