      "After upgrading from 1.11 to 1.12, users may encounter this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRqlClientError: MALFORMED PROTOBUF (missing field `type`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens when the running 1.11 server starts serving the web assets for the 1.12 server. The solution is to stop the 1.11 instance and then start the 1.12 instance (after migrating the data).\r\n\r\nPutting the web assets into the binary would also solve this issue. The gzipped web assets weigh under 2 MiB."
