      "Yes that is very likely the case, though this happened in the middle of aggressive testing for another issue we're working out (non-rethink related) - it took a while to realize that rethink had gone down on this machine so the details around what caused the crash are fuzzy. I'm installing the debug symbols on the three machines to try to get you a more useful backtrace if it happens again."
