      "@danielmewes isn't the solution here to use the raft id rather than the peer id with the `raft_directory` [here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/table_manager/table_manager.cc#L225)? raft id should change on each restart, whereas if you depend on the `peer_id_t` that will be the same (unless I misunderstand)"
