      "@mbroadst Ah, when it talks about \"joining the Raft cluster\" it actually means something different from connecting to other RethinkDB instances. A server joins the Raft cluster for a given table when it is made a replica for some of the shards of the table, and leaves it when you change the table configuration so that it's no longer a replica."
