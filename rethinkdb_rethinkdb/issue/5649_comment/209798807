      "Hi Brian,\r\n\r\ngreat writeup. I did not fully realise that Connection is designed to be long-lived and used by multiple threads. \r\n\r\nI took a look at your C# driver and it's ConnectionPool implementation - I think it's the proper way to implement connection pool.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this PR and will consider implementing a Connection pool in line with the C# one.
