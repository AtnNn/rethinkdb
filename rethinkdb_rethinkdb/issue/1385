        "Im inserting docs from a realtime stream that is about 2k docs/minute with each doc between 0.4k and 1k in size  ... after growing to about 30M docs, performance tanks. it swings between ~40 docs/sec and ~800 docs/sec for about 5 minutes each. I've got 4 clients performing one insert at a time, each pulling off of a queue and pushing into rethinkdb. While the machine is typically constantly loaded it has no problem with other things, for instance we're also testing mongo on the same box under the same workload and it keeps up just fine.\n\ni did have zone_recliam_mode set to 0 (it is a NUMA box). i've since turned that to 1 because of the way rethinkdb works - I thought running out of space in a zone could have been causing trouble. this didn't fix the problem.\n\nmongo was able to maintain a steady rate of about 2k docs per sec under the same load while running on the same box. turning off the mongo testing didn't seem to help either (not resource contention).\n\nthere are no indexes on the table other than primary key (which is generated on insert) and my clients are python.\n"
