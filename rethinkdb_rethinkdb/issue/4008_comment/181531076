      "Thanks for the writeup @tatsujin1 .\r\nOne thing where I'm not sure if I understand it correctly:\r\n\r\nIn the second case, \"document-specific expiration\", the `field` of the secondary index is assumed to contain a datetime value, and eviction is triggered when that value reaches `r.now()`, correct?\r\n\r\nNow what does the field mean in the first case, \"Shared/general expiration time\"? You say you can set it to anything, and that will start/reset the expiration timeout. But does it matter at all which `field` I create the index on? If I insert a document that doesn't have `field`, would that document still expire? Similarly if I update a document in the table, but don't update `field`, would the expiration timeout be reset for that document?"
