      "Thank you for the proposal @elifarley!\r\n\r\nI think instead of `r.pipe(src, dest)` we should support `insert` on a stream opened through `openStream` so that you can always write `dest.insert(src)` instead.\r\n\r\nGenerally I prefer leaving interacting with files to a client though. For some reason it feels more natural there.\r\n(your other proposals https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3838 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3832 would also make that more powerful)"
