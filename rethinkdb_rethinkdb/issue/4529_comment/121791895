      "@llambda Apart from the query size limitation (the limit is 64 MB in BASE64 encoding + some overhead), storing very large documents can use a lot of memory during backfills and when running certain queries that have to load data into memory. If you have a chunky server with a lot of RAM that might not be a problem, but it's one of the reasons for why we recommend not storing files of more than a few MB directly in a table at the moment."
