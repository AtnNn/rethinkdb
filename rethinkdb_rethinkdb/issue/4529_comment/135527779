      "I think having some limit here is useful, because very large queries could have a lot of performance side effects on the server that we aren't testing for.\r\n\r\nNow that storing binary data has become more common, I think 128 MB would be a more reasonable limit. That way you can transmit a 64 MB document + overhead in a query."
