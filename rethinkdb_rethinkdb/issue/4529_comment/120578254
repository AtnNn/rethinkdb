      "Hi @llambda --\r\n\r\nThanks for the report.  It looks like you're hitting the query size limit.  `r.binary` was designed to hold smallish chunks of binary data, not large files, so in general the way to solve this is to split your files into chunks.\r\n\r\nWe could certainly make the default query size limit higher though; moving this into 2.2 and tagging as `ReQL_proposal` to discuss whether or not we should do that."
