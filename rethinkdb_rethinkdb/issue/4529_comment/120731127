      "Ah, makes sense. I'm not yet sure how much binary data my app needs to store, maybe I am better off putting in files and storing references in the DB. I'd be quite interested in any info that becomes available as far as query limit size / effects / recommendation of storing lots of binary data in rethinkdb, or any thing of that sort. Thanks for the reply!"
