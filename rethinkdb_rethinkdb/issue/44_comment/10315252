      "It seems the problem is with the \"/tmp/pip-build/protobuf/setup.py\" that is downloaded when using the \"sudo pip install rethinkdb\" command. It contains several print statements that uses % to replace arguments in the string. Commenting those print statements (two of them in my version) makes the setup works. \r\n\r\nThis solution works python2, I haven't tested for python 3 yet. This is a protobuf issue then."
