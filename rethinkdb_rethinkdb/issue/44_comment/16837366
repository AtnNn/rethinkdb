      "@malthe -- do you have any idea if the kind folks at google would be willing to accept your protobuf library Python 3 patch? We'd love to get python 3 support for the driver, the only thing that's keeping us is the fact that we'd have to bundle the protobuf library with the driver, which is, for a number of reasons, very undesirable. (We *could* use upb, but that would require pretty significant testing effort)."
