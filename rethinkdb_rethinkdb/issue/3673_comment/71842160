      "I'm using Putty Release 0.60 (original post updated to reflect that).\r\nI've updated to Release 0.63, but it looks like the problem persists...\r\n\r\nI then tried the BitVise SSH client (downloaded from http://www.putty.org/), and it seems to solve the problem for a while... Then I got an error saying \"Failed to reconnect. Trying again ..\" that never goes away...\r\n\r\nLooking at BitVise's log, there IS traffic going on."
