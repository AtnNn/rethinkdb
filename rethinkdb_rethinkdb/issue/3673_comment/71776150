      "Actually I just updated Putty on my machine and now I cannot reproduce the issue anymore (was using a version that was a couple years old before, which matches what @gchpaco said).\r\n\r\n@elifarley if you're not already running the latest version, that's probably worth a try. If the problem persists, please let us know so we can investigate if anything else is wrong."
