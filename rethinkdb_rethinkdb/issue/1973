        "Even though ReQL is amazing beyond words there are times where sometimes you wanna drive into a scripting lanauge. I know rethinkdb includes r.js and nothing that i dont like about js. but there are a lot of functions that are bunded in other scritping lanauges that make some tasks a lot easier. And i know there slower and blah blah blah. But sometiems when prototypeing something something is slower. \r\n\r\nI know i have a ticket i just made for some encoding stuff. This would not be hard to do in most scripting lanauges since they have some built in functions for these things. The other thing about most of these is they make great use for prototyping new features for ReQL  I know this is far fetched and wont be able to be worked on for a while. but just putting it out there."
