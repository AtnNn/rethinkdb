      "This occurred in <=2.2 when the `r.args` expanded to zero arguments. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2588 fixes it in 2.3.\r\n\r\nThere's a workaround in that issue's first comment that you might be able to use if you're not ready to upgrade to 2.3: `r.getAll(r.args(dynamicThing.append('prevent-empty-error')), {index: ...})`\r\n\r\nClosing because I think that solves it. If you have any further questions, feel free to continue to comment here."
