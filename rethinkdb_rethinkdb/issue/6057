        "With #2598 there is now basic testing for `dump`/`restore` and friends. However the testing completed in that push is only the most basic positive testing, there is no testing at all for bad cases, or for any of the options beyond `--force`. Those test are going to look a little different, and so will be done in a separate push.\r\n\r\nA few things that I think should be included:\r\n- rebuilding outdated indexes\r\n- handling bad data\r\n- as many command line options as are practical, at a minimum `fields` and `custom-header`\r\n\r\nThis is going to require cleaning up this portion of the driver, as despite some work I did in the last push, the interface code is still wound tight into the process, so that will contribute to the effort required."
