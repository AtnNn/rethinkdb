      "The problem is that `[]` desugars to either `nth` or `get_field` depending on the type of its argument, and if you use a ReQL argument then we don't know what type to use.  The fix for this is to add a new term `bracket` on the server that does the overloading at runtime, but for the moment the only fix is to use either `nth` or `get_field` explicitly depending on which one you want."
