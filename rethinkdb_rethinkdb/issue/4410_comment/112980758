      "Completely agree and to be clear I'm not a fan of the name `no_conflict`. It would also be difficult to discover this functionality because you wouldn't really expect it to be part of `insert`.\r\n\r\nWe could maybe special-case an array argument to `table.update()`, but that's also a little unclear and I could see people running into it on accident. I'm interested to hear what others suggest."
