        "For a \"quick search\" function in a web application I needed to see if the given id (primary key) existed and retrieve just a couple of attributes.  I thought the natural approach would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table('xyzzy').get(id).pluck('id', 'a', 'b')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `id` is not valid, I was expecting the entire query to return `null`.  Instead I get this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRqlRuntimeError: Cannot perform pluck on a non-object non-sequence `null` in ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIntuitively I would expect that there would be no rows for pluck to even operate on.  Granted I'm coming from years of SQL where the select clause has no effect if there are no rows, but this does seem a very natural query.\r\n\r\nSome questions:\r\n* What is the best way to accomplish this with the current code base?\r\n* Would it be possible to have pluck detect that there are actually no rows and not throw?\r\n* Should something be added to the pluck API docs and Cookibook for this?\r\n"
