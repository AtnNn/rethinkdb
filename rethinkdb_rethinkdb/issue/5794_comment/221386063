      "@monkeyboy64 If you apply `count()` directly on a table there's an optimization that skips loading the full documents. However if you apply it after another operation (including indexed ones), RethinkDB actually loads every document.\r\n\r\nEspecially if your data is on a rotational disk or slow network storage and doesn't fully fit into cache, this can take a long time.\r\n\r\nWe have plans to make `count` be an essentially constant-time operation in the future https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3949 , but currently it's just a reduction like any other (with the mentioned optimization in case you apply it to the whole table).\r\n\r\nI think this is currently expected behavior. You might want to follow https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3949 for future improvements to `count`."
