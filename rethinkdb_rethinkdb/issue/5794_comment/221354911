      "@monkeyboy64 Which version of RethinkDB are you using? Are you running the query in the Data Explorer or with a client?\r\n\r\nIf it's in the Data Explorer, I suspect that the query might time out. Older versions of RethinkDB had an issue that caused timeouts to be reported as \"interrupted for an unknown reason\". The timeout does not apply to other clients. Could you try running the query in a node.js script or in Python? If you have the latest version of the Python driver installed (`sudo pip install --upgrade rethinkdb`), you can run the query as follows:\r\n```py\r\n$ python -m rethinkdb repl\r\nThe RethinkDB driver has been imported as `r`.\r\n==========\r\n>>> r.db(\"numetric\").table(\"prostar__2cef1ff5_9a7e_4ddf_a405_04a2d0a26757\").get_all(True, index=\"indexed\").count().run()\r\n```"
