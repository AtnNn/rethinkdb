      "I am using rethinkdb 2.2.4 on ubuntu.\r\n\r\nWhen I run the query in python it takes a long time. After several minutes it still hasn't come back. While the query is running if I look at activity on the table it seems like it is reading through the entire table 7000 records at a time. I have an index, so it seems like it should just come back.\r\n\r\nIf I run r.db(\"numetric\").table(\"prostar__2cef1ff5_9a7e_4ddf_a405_04a2d0a26757\").count().run() instead the count will come back in 2 minutes."
