        "I have three servers each running RethinkDB latest `2.1.4` in a cluster. I was surprised to see so much intra-cluster network activity when I ran `nload` on the primary server *(no reads or writes happening)*.\r\n\r\nIs it expected to burst up to `2.6 Mbit/s` with just cluster health and pings? Perhaps there is room for optimization here? Mainly just curious if this is considered normal.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2015-09-18 at 6 45 14 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/523312/9974072/eaa24bb6-5e35-11e5-83cd-2d117fe12e3a.png)\r\n"
