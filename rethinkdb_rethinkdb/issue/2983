        "The purpose of this issue is to discuss the format of the `rethinkdb.table_status` system table. In the current prototype, the structure is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_status').run()\r\n[ { u'name': u'test.foo',\r\n    u'shards': [ { u'batgirl_local_h4v': { u'role': u'director',\r\n                                           u'state': u'ready'},\r\n                   u'batgirl_local_q47': { u'role': u'replica',\r\n                                           u'state': u'ready'}}],\r\n    u'uuid': u'4e8c0328-44f9-40c7-b5b7-51e987c9bcf6'}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn #2957 we decided that this format was bad. There were several proposals to replace it:\r\n\r\n* @coffeemug suggested\r\n    ```\r\n    shards: [ { replicas: [{ batgirl_local_h4v: 'ready' },\r\n                           { batgirl_local_q47: 'ready' }],\r\n                master: 'batgirl_local_h4v' }]\r\n    ```\r\n    He emphasizes that the format of `table_status` should mirror the format of `table_config`.\r\n\r\n* @mlucy suggested that we change the format of the `replicas` field in Slava's suggestion to `{ready: ['batgirl_local_h4v', 'batgirl_local_g47'], down: []}` or `{batgirl_local_h4v: 'ready', batgirl_local_g47: 'ready'}`.\r\n\r\n* @neumino suggested `shards: [{ 'name': <server_name>, 'role': <role>, 'state': <state> }, ...]`. He also requested a simple way to get the overall status of the table, such as a toplevel field with values `\"ready\"`, `\"read_only\"`, and `\"down\"`.\r\n\r\nI have a couple of other comments about these:\r\n\r\n* We eventually want to expose backfill information and the number of documents per shard via `table_status`. The format should accommodate that. (My original plan was that we would have an additional `backfill_progress` field alongside `role` and `state`.)\r\n\r\n* Do we want to show the user per-shard status information, or is overall status information enough? @neumino's suggestion doesn't seem to include per-shard status information."
