Obviously, I'm pushing it too hard, but even if I try to limit it to 100,000 or filter it with index then delete those, it still chokes up. I also tried restarting RethinkDB Server and clean up cache.\n\n```\nr.db(\"database\").table(\"sampletable\").delete()\n\ne: Query terminated by an unknown cause in:\nr.db(\"database\").table(\"sampletable\").delete()\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n```\n"
