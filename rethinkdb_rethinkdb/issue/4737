        "When using a high availability cluster setup _(version 2.1.1)_ with 3 nodes, did the syntax for connecting in the Javascript client change? Currently I am just specifying the primary nodes ip `10.240.102.7` like:\n\n``` javascript\nr.connect({\n    host: '10.240.102.7',\n    port: 28015,\n    db: 'macd',\n    table: 'playground',\n    timeout: 10\n}, function(error, connection) {\n    ...\n});\n```\n\nDo I now have to provide all of the nodes in the clusters config host? If not, how does this work if `10.240.102.7` is down?\n"
