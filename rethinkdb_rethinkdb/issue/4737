        "When using a high availability cluster setup *(version 2.1.1)* with 3 nodes, did the syntax for connecting in the Javascript client change? Currently I am just specifying the primary nodes ip `10.240.102.7` like:\r\n\r\n````javascript\r\nr.connect({\r\n    host: '10.240.102.7',\r\n    port: 28015,\r\n    db: 'macd',\r\n    table: 'playground',\r\n    timeout: 10\r\n}, function(error, connection) {\r\n    ...\r\n});\r\n`````\r\n\r\nDo I now have to provide all of the nodes in the clusters config host? If not, how does this work if `10.240.102.7` is down?"
