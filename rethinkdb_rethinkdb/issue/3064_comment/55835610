      "* The `resources` sub-document in `server_status` seems odd to me. In particular, `cache_size_mb` feels like it doesn't fit with the others. I suggest that `cache_size_mb` should be an immutable field on `server_config`. I also think `resources` should be renamed. Without `cache_size_mb`, it's really more like a set of identifiers.\r\n\r\n* The `host` field currently reports the hostname of the first canonical address, and the `port` field reports the local port that the server is listening on. But CR 2091 will rename the `host` field to `hostname` and make it report the return value of `gethostname()`. I think we should use the CR 2091 behavior but add a `canonical_addresses` field with a list of the canonical addresses.\r\n\r\n* I don't feel strongly about what `reconfigure()` should do with no arguments.\r\n\r\n* By \"reshard lexicographically\" do you mean \"generate shard boundaries such that if the user uses UUIDs their data will be evenly distributed\"? That's what I think we should do.\r\n\r\n* Where in `server_status` should `version` go?"
