      "@coffeemug:\r\n* We need a final proposal for what to do about the `resources` sub-document of `server_status`.\r\n* Can you clarify how we should pick shard boundaries if the user tries to shard an empty table? In particular, do you have any objections to sharding as though the primary keys will be UUIDs?\r\n* We need a final proposal for how to expose host and port information. This might be related to #3179.\r\n* Where in `server_status` should the `version` field go?"
