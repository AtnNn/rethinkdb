      "> * We need a final proposal for what to do about the `resources` sub-document of `server_status`.\r\n* We need a final proposal for how to expose host and port information. This might be related to #3179.\r\n* Where in `server_status` should the `version` field go?\r\n\r\nI'd like to leave this up to you, having thought about it more I don't think I have any brilliant insights. (I'll watch this issue, so if red flags come up on whatever proposal we end up on, I'll comment)\r\n\r\n> * Can you clarify how we should pick shard boundaries if the user tries to shard an empty table? In particular, do you have any objections to sharding as though the primary keys will be UUIDs?\r\n\r\nIf the table is empty I have no objects to sharding lexicographically in the UUID space. I think that would be great."
