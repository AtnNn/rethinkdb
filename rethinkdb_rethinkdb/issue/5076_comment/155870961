      "The suggested representation only works when there is a constant rough average between two intervals. Which isn't the case when data comes in in intervals greater than one second and the representation ends up in peaks. But also if data was having significant outliers the current representation fails.\r\n\r\nI absolutely don't want to bike shed here, enough more pressing interfacing issues around. But I consider fixing the correct aggregation or fix the presentation of point values a trivial task a frontend open source developer could solve."
