      "Hi @skinkie, thanks for opening an issue about this.\r\n\r\nThe line graph is meant to provide a rough overview about how much is going on in the cluster, not a statistically exact visualization. I think it works much better for this visually than a bar chart.\r\nSo I don't think we're going to change this.\r\n\r\nMay I ask why you think that it suggests more activity than actually takes place though? I think it is largely unbiased. The area under the line should correspond to the number of queries that have been run during a given time frame.\r\nWe do perform linear interpolation between data points, but that should average out (i.e. equally often over-estimate and under-estimate the actual throughput), assuming your load doesn't vary in a certain pattern that is tightly synchronized with the times at which the server's performance counters reset."
