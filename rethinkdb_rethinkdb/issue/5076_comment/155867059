      "Note that the reads/s and writes/s are counted on the server within a 1 second interval. The data that the web UI receives is always the number from the most recent complete 1 second interval (in practice we have multiple such counters for different parts of the data that we sum over. Their 1-second windows can be slightly misaligned, which makes the value more similar to a moving average with a 1 second window size, though not exactly the same)."
