      "> So a record with a primary key of 4 will always go to the same server\r\n\r\nThanks @larkost. Makes sense.\r\n\r\nNow, [this SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35006761/rethinkdb-replace-with-getall/35006881#35006881) suggests that one way to guarantee uniqueness is to create another table  but I just realized that you end up with data split across shards. i.e. user data is in one shard but the user's email might be in a different one (different PKs)\r\n\r\nIs there a best practice to this problem or is this just an inherent problem of distributed DBs which must be handled at the application layer?"
