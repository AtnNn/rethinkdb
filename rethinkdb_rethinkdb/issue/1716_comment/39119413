      "@tchoulihan -- Thanks for the feedback. It was closed because in sharded/distributed environment, such feature is usually not provided.\r\nBut I'm not an expert in all SQL databases, so I may have missed some. Do you have a SQL system in mind that have unique indexes on a sharded table?\r\n\r\nI tried to look on Google, but from what I've found, the unique indexes can only be defined per table (if not partitioned), or per partition (in which case you cannot enforce a unique index on your whole table).\r\n"
