      "I'm kind of opposed. I think we should just have this issue be about having functional primary keys, which isn't too hard and I think actually lets users basically do what they want to do here. Users don't actually want to be able to have secondary indexes be unique they want to be able to have multiple fields in their documents be unique which is a feature we can actually give them."
