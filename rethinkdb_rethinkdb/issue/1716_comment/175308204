      "Well, in this case you'd just create a primary key with `email` and drop the `id` entirely. But in a more general case where you can't drop the second field, it would have to be a field you already know (or can query). Then you insert both fields, and if they fail you know the row already exists. (Again, not ideal, but a reasonable workaround in many cases)"
