      "@tchoulihan -- to add to @neumino's comment, it turns out that unique indexes are nearly impossible to implement in a distributed system while still maintaining performance. If you look at other NoSQL systems, this functionality is rarely if ever implemented, and practically never used for this reason. So we decided not to implement it in RethinkDB because the laws of physics prevent us from doing it effectively.\r\n\r\n(I agree it's inconvenient; we'll continue thinking about possible options to see if we can do better)"
