      "@neumino Maybe this is new in Mongo 3.0 or 3.2, but I just discovered that it's not entirely true that you can't have unique secondary indexes in sharded Mongo collections.  [If the shard key is a prefix of the index, Mongo *can* guarantee uniqueness](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharding-shard-key/#unique-indexes), because guaranteeing uniqueness within an individual chunk is easy, and the chunks are guaranteed to be disjoint."
