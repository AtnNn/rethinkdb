      "This is an inherent problem in distributed DBs (can't have a unique secondary index without dramatically slowing everything down). The best way to get around it is to use compound primary keys and make one of the components the bit of data you'd normally store in a secondary index. This is fairly counterintuitive to a lot of people, so a long term solution might be to allow unique secondary indexes and making them a part of a primary key under the hood, but this solution has a bunch of problems. We'll try to look into it and come up with something viable in 2016."
