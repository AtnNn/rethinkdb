      "Ok, so it looks like first order of business is to make the following two fixes:\r\n\r\n1. Turn off extproc \"end-of-file received\" messages because they always only muddle the issue\r\n2. Fix the 'crash after crash' issue\r\n\r\nOnce we do that, we can be much better about not confusing people and getting to the real issues behind bug reports. Assigning to @Tryneus."
