        "There are currently three ways to configure the cluster:\r\n\r\n* The Web UI\r\n* `rethinkdb admin`\r\n* The very undocumented and user unfriendly RESTful API (this is a stretch)\r\n\r\nI had dozens of people ask for a way to programmatically configure the cluster. I don't know what the solution is, but here are a couple of options I can think of:\r\n\r\n* Make the documentation for `rethinkdb admin` much more prominent\r\n* Add a porcelain RESTful API for cluster configuration and document it really well\r\n* Add the meta functionality to the drivers\r\n* Some combination of the above\r\n\r\nWrote this up so we keep track of it. Putting in backlog."
