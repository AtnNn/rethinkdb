        "There are currently three ways to configure the cluster:\n- The Web UI\n- `rethinkdb admin`\n- The very undocumented and user unfriendly RESTful API (this is a stretch)\n\nI had dozens of people ask for a way to programmatically configure the cluster. I don't know what the solution is, but here are a couple of options I can think of:\n- Make the documentation for `rethinkdb admin` much more prominent\n- Add a porcelain RESTful API for cluster configuration and document it really well\n- Add the meta functionality to the drivers\n- Some combination of the above\n\nWrote this up so we keep track of it. Putting in backlog.\n"
