      "I think in contrast to #3978 this should simply shut down the server as if CTRL+C was pressed, interrupting any running queries.\r\n\r\nA slightly awkward thing about the interface is that this is sort of a mixture between configuration and status. It's not part of the permanent server configuration like the other things that we currently have in the `server_config` system table. We already have similar fields in `server_status`, including a `status` field that is either `\"connected\"` or `\"disconnected\"`, as well as a `\"process\"` sub document.\r\nI think it would feel natural to have a `shutting_down` field in the `process` document that could be set to `true`. However `server_status` is currently read-only."
