        "Since i need this database to work to being able to use SageMathCloud on my home server, i started to see if i was able to port this server to FreeBSD. \nI was thinking to not being enough capable of doing this, instead i\8217ve already achieved to being able to fully compile it and even to run tests for a good half of it. I've worked on this for the last two days, especially because i had a lot of problem with V8.\nLogs:\n\n[configure_logs.txt](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/files/372165/configure_logs.txt)\n[test_logs.txt](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/files/372168/test_logs.txt)\n\nNow it seems that two problem remains:\nSome error about deleting folders, that makes starting the main executable impossible, for now.\n\n```\nerror: Error in thread 1 in src/utils.cc at line 540:\nerror: Guarantee failed: [res == 0]  (errno 2 - No such file or directory) Fatal error: failed to delete '/tmp/rdb_unittest.QUYBCw/tmp'.\n\n```\n\nSeems to be some directory filesystem problem, but i've still to track it down.\n\nThe other seems to be a lot of failures on src/unittest/rpc stuff, same stuff above, need to understand from where are coming.\n\nAnd lastly, some crash happens after a while with this error, while executing the tests:\n\n```\nerror: Error in thread 1 in src/errors.cc at line 175:\nerror: std::terminate() called without any exception.\n```\n\nThe backtrace is available on the logs.\n"
