      "Hi @pzol -- we've been debating this for a while. The benefit of keeping the drivers in the same repo as the main project is that it's very easy (operationally) to do language changes that touch both the driver and the server. We're doing lots of these now, so while the annealing temperature is high, we'd like to keep these together. The ReQL API will stabilize in about a month or two, and at that point we'll reconsider moving the drivers out.\r\n\r\nI'm moving this issue to backlog for the moment, let's revisit when ReQL is a bit more stable."
