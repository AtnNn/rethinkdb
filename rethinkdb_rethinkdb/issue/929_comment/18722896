      "@pzol -- I realize that it's sort of a pain to pull the whole repo, but there are some advantages:\r\n* It integrates with our testing system, which has to spin up an instance of RethinkDB -- this makes it easy to test whether you've made a breaking change to the driver.\r\n* The driver and server are always in sync, which is important right now because as @coffeemug notes we're adding a lot of new RQL terms.\r\n* We have some tools that depend on the drivers -- we used to have a fuzzer that used the Ruby client, we have a stress client that uses the Python client, and the data explorer uses the JavaScript client.  Submodules are sort of a pain in git, so it's really convenient to have the clients in the same source tree.\r\n\r\nI agree with @coffeemug that we should re-visit this when the RQL API stabilizes.\r\n\r\n(Also, @pzol, if you have time it would be really nice to get your perspective on what parts of the client are confusing for rubyists!)"
