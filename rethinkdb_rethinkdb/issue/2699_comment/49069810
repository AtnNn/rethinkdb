      "I think that if at all possible, we should support null chars in the middle of strings. People often have data with null chars interspersed, and asking them to sanitize it results in a bad experience. I'm not sure how to deal with json spec conflicts, but if we could find a reasonable way of doing it, I think it would help a lot to be permissive about it.\r\n\r\n(Failing that, we should make the error message better, but I think it's not an ideal solution)\r\n\r\nMoving to 1.14-polish."
