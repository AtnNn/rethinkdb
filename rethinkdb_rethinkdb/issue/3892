        "Currently in the polyglot \"drivers\" for JavaScript and Python the `bag` method can not take anything other than: numbers, strings, arrays, None/undefined, and dicts. So for instance we can't make a `bag` of `bag`s.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this is unfortunately a bit of a pain: recode the central part of each driver that does the comparison of tests to provide [less than, equal, more than] rather than the true/false that it reports now, and then use that to do the sorting. In JavaScript case this is going to be especially nasty as almost everything uses functions to evaluate equity.\r\n\r\nThis is not required at the moment, but this is a placeholder for when we do need it."
