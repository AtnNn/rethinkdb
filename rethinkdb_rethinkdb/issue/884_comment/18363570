      "By my reading of the proposal\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.expr({ 'a': null })('a').eq(null).default(5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill evaluate to `true` (and @coffeemug owes me lunch if that's the case). However I still like the idea of implementing this with different error types rather than with this handler business because I think it has some other weird behaviors and seems like more work to implement. However I'm still not sure I fully understand the proposal so I'm going to wait until I can ask @mlucy some questions before outlining a multiple error types proposal."
