      "I'm totally cool with `rescue` handling both nulls and errors. But I'd like a way to *not* do that in case I accidentally catch errors I didn't intend on catching, so I need a way to just provide a default for just non-existence.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the use case of handling errors but *not* handling non-existence (`catch`) seems purely theoretical to me, and I'd only add such command for completion."
