      "This latest iteration of the default proposal makes the most sense to me. The fundamental problem that we have been wrestling with has been both a desire to treat `null` as a kind of error and a desire to let most other kinds of errors pass through. It sounds obvious now in retrospect but to make this work we ultimately need to support different types of errors.\r\n\r\nIn this too are the seeds of a more robust error handling system. Eventually it will make sense to let users define error types and catch specific error types with a more general catch command. For the time being though, this limited `default` proposal has the advantage of limited scope while exactly covering most the use cases this issue was originally designed to address.\r\n\r\nIn short, I'm actually happy accepting this as is."
