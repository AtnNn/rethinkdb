      "So one objection I have with this is I think it's really weird to have the same command for handling `null` and handling errors. `default` makes a lot of intuitive sense as something that provides a value when one isn't present which is what `null` represents but an `error` isn't just a simple as the absence of a value so I don't think it makes the same intuitive sense. It also I think this is also potentially dangerous because it makes it very easy for an error to go unnoticed because people put a `default` in to handle `null` and then it handles `error` without them realizing it.\r\n\r\nWould people be opposed to having `default` handle `null` and `catch` handle `error`s. I think `catch is a term that everyone's pretty familiar with and this would more or less match the meaning of it that have in their heads."
