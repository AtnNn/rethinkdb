      "I think the kind of default just described by @mlucy is perfect for its purpose (that is what I think its purpose should be ;-) ). I also like rescue (or alternatively recover) as a name for the second function. Following @mlucy 's proposal to have its argument either being null or the error seems to cover all use cases that I can think of."
