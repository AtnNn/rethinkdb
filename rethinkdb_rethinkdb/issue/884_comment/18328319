      "@mlucy: Would there be a problem with having accessing a null value throw the same error as accessing a non-existent field? default would catch exactly that one error, while catch would catch either all, or all except for that one. The multiplication example would work with default exactly as you suggested.\r\n\r\nThis behavior could still be changed by setting a flag on a per-query or per-command level, in which case null should probably trigger neither default nor any error."
