      "I agree that having three commands has a bit of a cognitive burden, but it still doesn't seem like a bad idea to me. One specifically bad thing in the proposal is the name `catch_all` (and duality with `catch`). Suppose you rename it such that you can say `x.default(y)` for non-existence, `x.on_error(y)` for errors (instead of `catch`), and `x.rescue(y)` instead of `x.default(y).on_error(y)`.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't seem terrible to me because you don't have to start with explaining everything to people. You tell them to use `rescue` and then if they need more control, you explain `default` and `on_error`. That seems ok to me."
