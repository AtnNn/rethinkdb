      "There are a few things we'll do:\r\n\r\n1. Document the relevant new and changed API functions in the API docs\r\n2. When one of the nonexistence error messages actually gets thrown to the user, include a URL to an FAQ in the error message.\r\n3. Write up an FAQ entry and describe how this works.\r\n\r\nSince `filter` will now not throw on non-existence by default, most people likely won't run into any of this stuff anyway."
