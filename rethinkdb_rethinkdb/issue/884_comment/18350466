      "By \"roughtly\" I mean that I think `rescue` should accept either a value or a function. If it's a value, it just gets returned. If it's a function, it gets evaluated with the text of error message or nil as argument and its return value gets returned. This way they'll just be able to say `.rescue(5)` (which I think is very important).\r\n\r\nAlso, for now, I wouldn't expose the condition API to users. We can do that later, but for now I think it should internal."
