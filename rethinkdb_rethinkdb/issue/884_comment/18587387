      "I'm not sure that \"simple\" is the right word to describe this proposal but \"simpler\" relative to some of the other ideas contained herein is certainly appropriate. I'm reasonably happy with where this ended up though, of course, I have to repeat my usual concern that any \"helpful\" special casing based on what we assume to be the common pattern will come back to bite us in the rear.\r\n\r\nFor now, I only ask, how do you think the documentation for this is going to look? This is still complicated enough (defining what distinguishes a non-existance error, highlighting contexts with an implicit `default`) that it might be really hard for users to pick up and use correctly."
