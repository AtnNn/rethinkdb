      "Just a quick note: If catch will be implemented, please don't forget to also implement rethrow(). Calling r.error(...) with the error message is not equivalent, as it loses the backtrace.\r\n\r\nAlso +1 to @jdoliner's concerns regarding catching both null and all errors with default. I don't know how difficult this is on the side of implementation, but from a user's perspective it makes total sense for default to catch null and absent fields, but not any other error. The fact that the absence of fields currently triggers an error which - except for its message - is indistinguishable from other errors is just an implementation detail."
