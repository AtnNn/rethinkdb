      "I think it's really important that people be able to write something like:\r\n```ruby\r\ntable.update{|row| {:score => row[:score].default(0) + 1}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd have it work regardless of whether `score` is NULL or non-existent.  I think in general we want to move toward NULL and non-existence being more similar.\r\n\r\nWe've been using NULL as a user value, but a lot of people seem to be using it to mean non-existence in their data sets (probably becaues of SQL's influence).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think having separate commands to handle NULL and errors is probably a bad idea, because I think people will end up having to write things like `row[:score].default(0).catch{|e| 0}` a lot.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI don't feel terribly certain about the name `default` vs. `catch`.  I think I like `default` slightly more because I think that 99% of the time people are going to be using this term while thinking \"I want to provide a default value for this expression.\".  Also, if we do keep one term that handles both NULL and errors (which I think we should) then `catch` would be a very confusing name because people wouldn't expect those semantics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@coffeemug -- could you weigh in on this?  I'm curious what you think, both about how confusing the two (three?) options are and what you think users actually want to do with this term."
