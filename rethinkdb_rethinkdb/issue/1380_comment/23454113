      "This doesn't look like an OOM error. Most likely it's a bug in Rethink.\r\n\r\nOne thing to be aware of is that our 32-bit build is a lot less tested than the 64-bit build, since the overwhelming majority of our users run on 64-bit systems. This bug might be present in the 64-bit system too, but I think it's quite likely it's exclusively a 32-bit issue.\r\n\r\nWe'll work on fixing this ASAP. Thank you for reporting it."
