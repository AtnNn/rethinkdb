      "I just wanted to let you know that (at least from my point of view) this is **not** an urgent issue (well apart from being a bit disappointed that I cannot ignore _not production-ready_ label just yet), \r\n\r\nThere are no production systems involved, I can patiently wait and evaluate 1.9.x and 1.10.x and 2.0.0+ once they are released. \r\n\r\nAlso to balance the 'negative' crash reports: \r\n - if I configure the cluster like a normal person would (change config once, let it propagate, and leave! it! alone!) it seems pretty solid. I haven't seen any problems during CRUD operations OR simulated failover\r\n - no documents were ever lost! none! zip! zero! what I put in, I was able to get out!\r\n - unfortunately cluster instability is a show-stopper at work for now, but RQL is SO INSANELY SWEET I'll continue to use rethinkdb for my hobby projects :-)\r\n"
