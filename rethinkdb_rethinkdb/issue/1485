        "I was benchmarking meta data operations but noticed that the results were not consistent. The operations got slower each time I ran the benchmark.\n\nThe operation in question is a dbCreate followed by a dbDrop.\n\nI assume that this is because we keep the old metadata IDs around in the semi-lattice to mark them as deleted. Does that make sense?\n\nThis is unlikely to be an issue in practice right now, but we should eventually figure out a way to garbage collect the metadata.\nI imagine that we could safely purge a deleted metadata entry as soon as all nodes have persisted the delete?\n"
