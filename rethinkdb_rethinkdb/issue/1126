        "Hi all,\nI installed Rethinkdb on CentOS (RethinkDB 1.6.1-121-gf4b1de-dirty) and I would like to launch 2 instances on the same machine, I dropped in /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d/ 2 config files (foo1.conf and foo2.conf)(editing the default one shipped with Rethinkdb).\n\nI customized \"bind=\" (to bind both on server's public ip address), I customized in foo2.conf also the \"join=\" to make it to join the server started with foo1.conf.\n\nOn start Rethinkdb warns me about foo2.conf instance because it uses default ports already used by foo1.conf but reading on default config file it seems it should auto-increment \"port-offset\" if it's not differently specified in config file.\n\nSo I tryed to customize in foo2.conf the \"port-offset=10\" with no luck, the same warning appeared.\n\nTo make them work I had to manually specify all ports in foo2.conf\n\nMaybe I didn't understand correctly or maybe there are some bugs in config management.\n"
