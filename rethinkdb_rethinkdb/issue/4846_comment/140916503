      "Thanks @marshall007 !\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we want to do this for all aggregation terms, though I don't have any particular objection to it, and I can see the added consistency in that.\r\n\r\nWe usually try to do all discussion of ReQL related proposals in a certain time frame early during the release planning, and it's now a bit too late for squeezing that into 2.2.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's any controversy about the terms you currently changed in this PR, so I would be happy to merge those into 2.2 and leave the discussion of the wider change that includes `reduce`, `count`, `group` etc. for 2.3.\r\n\r\nWould it be ok if we did both together for 2.3, or would you prefer to have us merge what you've done so far into 2.2, and then have a second discussion for 2.3?"
