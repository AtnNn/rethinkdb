      "Since we're not overloading, I'm tempted to go ahead and support this for the remaining aggregation terms (`reduce`, `count`, `contains`, even `group`?). Thoughts?\r\n\r\nThere's no obvious reason why you'd ever want to use the infix `r.count([ ... ])`, but I think it's slightly better that you *could* if you wanted to rather than us making arbitrary distinctions based on what we think people might actually use."
