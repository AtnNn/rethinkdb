      "@danielmewes totally up to you guys. Merging everything at once for 2.3 sounds good to me. I just happened to run into this yesterday; it's not something I encounter very often.\r\n\r\nOr if, before the 2.2 release, someone comes up with good reasons to never include `reduce`, `count`, and `group` then we could go ahead and merge this as-is."
