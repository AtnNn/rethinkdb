      "@mlucy Can you think of a more general criteria for distinguishing allowed from disallowed terms? If we make `pluck` work, we should also make a bunch of other terms work. Anything that can be reduced to a `map` is probably ok, but `concatMap` and similar ones are not, right?\r\n\r\nI think I'd prefer to disallow all of them for consistency, rather than white-listing a few particular transformations.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should also change add a note to the error message that suggests moving the transformation(s) to before the `limit` to make it more helpful."
