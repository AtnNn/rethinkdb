Is this expected behavior? How do I restore into an \"empty\" rethinkdb instance, since those tables are created automatically? I know I can `--force` like the message says, but that is kind of scary to do on rethinkdb internal tables.\r\n\r\nLog output from the server:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInitializing directory /Users/chrismcc/workspace/ti-node/rethinkdb_data\r\nRunning rethinkdb 1.16.0-1 (CLANG 4.2 (clang-425.0.28))...\r\nRunning on Darwin 14.1.0 x86_64\r\nLoading data from directory /Users/chrismcc/workspace/ti-node/rethinkdb_data\r\nListening for intracluster connections on port 29015\r\nListening for client driver connections on port 28015\r\nListening for administrative HTTP connections on port 8080\r\nListening on addresses: 127.0.0.1, ::1\r\nTo fully expose RethinkDB on the network, bind to all addresses by running rethinkdb with the `--bind all` command line option.\r\nServer ready, \"goldie_local_yck\" fc44f620-0dda-4a48-9ca9-fb8c1882eeb0\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy to send the dump along, just let me know."
