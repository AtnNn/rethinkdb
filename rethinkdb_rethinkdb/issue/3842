        "This is new with the 1.16 release.\n\nWith a fresh rethinkdb instance (e.g. `rm -r rethinkdb_data` then starting up rethinkdb with just `rethinkdb`), running `rethinkdb restore rethinkdb_dump_2015-02-26T05\\:17\\:02.tar.gz` gives me this:\n\n```\nUnzipping archive file...\n  Done (1 seconds)\nImporting from directory...\nError: The following tables already exist, run with --force to import into the existing tables:\n  rethinkdb.cluster_config\n  rethinkdb.current_issues\n  rethinkdb.db_config\n  rethinkdb.jobs\n  rethinkdb.logs\n  rethinkdb.server_config\n  rethinkdb.server_status\n  rethinkdb.stats\n  rethinkdb.table_config\n  rethinkdb.table_status\nError: rethinkdb-import failed\n```\n\nThe server was dumped with `rethinkdb dump` on the same version of rethinkdb. Is this expected behavior? How do I restore into an \"empty\" rethinkdb instance, since those tables are created automatically? I know I can `--force` like the message says, but that is kind of scary to do on rethinkdb internal tables.\n\nLog output from the server:\n\n```\nInitializing directory /Users/chrismcc/workspace/ti-node/rethinkdb_data\nRunning rethinkdb 1.16.0-1 (CLANG 4.2 (clang-425.0.28))...\nRunning on Darwin 14.1.0 x86_64\nLoading data from directory /Users/chrismcc/workspace/ti-node/rethinkdb_data\nListening for intracluster connections on port 29015\nListening for client driver connections on port 28015\nListening for administrative HTTP connections on port 8080\nListening on addresses: 127.0.0.1, ::1\nTo fully expose RethinkDB on the network, bind to all addresses by running rethinkdb with the `--bind all` command line option.\nServer ready, \"goldie_local_yck\" fc44f620-0dda-4a48-9ca9-fb8c1882eeb0\n```\n\nHappy to send the dump along, just let me know.\n"
