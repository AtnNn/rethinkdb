      "The good news is that it's extremely unlikely that all of your databases just disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe \"Connected to Uknown\" suggests though that the web UI has issues retrieving information from the database server, which is probably also why it doesn't list any databases or tables (since it's still trying to retrieve the database list). Are you able to run any queries in the Data Explorer or with a client driver?\r\nDoes `r.dbList()` give you a list of databases?\r\n\r\nWhat are the last few lines of the RethinkDB log_file (in the data directory)?"
