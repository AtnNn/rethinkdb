        "This adds a heartbeat service on top of the clustering layer which will shut down an inter-machine connection after ~10 seconds of inactivity (this should probably be tweaked or configurable in the future).  This replaces TCP_KEEPALIVE and TCP_USER_TIMEOUT, which will give us some more compatibility with other platforms and older kernels."
