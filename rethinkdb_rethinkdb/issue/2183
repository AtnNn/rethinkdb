        "Here are a few issues I noticed when building 1.12.0 that I want to fix, ideally before 1.12.1:\n- [x] `pkg.sh` should unset DESTDIR, otherwise `make install` breaks\n- [x] v8 fails to build on some versions of GCC. The `-fno-function-sections` and `-fno-inline-functions` flags fix this.\n- [x] `build-rpm.sh` refers to `support.mk` which doesn't exist anymore\n- [x] building libunwind sometimes requires the `--build=` flag\n- ~~the list of dependencies in `build-rpm.sh` are wrong~~\n- [x] `fpm` is not called with the correct `--architecture` flag (#2176)\n- [x] Some other issues with `build-rpm.sh` (#1491)\n- [ ] the stress client sometimes fails to build. Remove `-Werror`\n"
