      "Same error on another ubuntu instance, running them with init scripts.  I just removed the ```rethinkdb_data``` dir, also re-wrote the instance.conf file. Removing the data dir somehow fixed it! \r\n\r\nPreviously no activities were being written on the ```log_file```, and the web-console would generate the error. Must have been wrong permissions on the ```log_file``` with the rethinkdb ```user-group```. Changed it to root."
