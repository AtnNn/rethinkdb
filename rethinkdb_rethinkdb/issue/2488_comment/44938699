      "I was logging out of the bash console so I redirected ```stderr``` to a file with ```rethinkdb --bind all >> log_all 2>&1 &``` I have a lot of RAM. But why the need for a console? Can't it simply redirect ```stdout``` and ```stderr``` to a file. \r\n\r\nOn the rethinkDB admin console ```8080``` I get a zombie server warning, after removing the test DB upon a promp even after Killing the server."
