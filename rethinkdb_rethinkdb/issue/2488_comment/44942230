      "Here is how the zombie issue can arise:\r\n\r\n- You create a cluster of two machines (A and B)\r\n- Shut down machine B\r\n- Log into the console on machine A and permanently remove machine B\r\n- Start up machine B again (with the `-j` flag to join machine A). It will now appear as a zombie\r\n\r\nTo fix this, simply remove the `rethinkdb_data` directory from machine B. You can now join it to machine A and it will work fine.\r\n\r\nAs far as the logging issue, what are the permissions for `log_all`? Does the user starting RethinkDB have full access to it?"
