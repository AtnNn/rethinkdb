      "@ianjuma -- thanks for reporting this and sticking with it until we get to the bottom of what's going on!\r\n\r\nI have a few follow-up questions:\r\n\r\n- What's the output of `ls -l /var/lib/rethinkdb/default/tmp` and `ls -l /var/lib/rethinkdb/default`?\r\n- Did you create the data directory before running `service rethinkdb start`? If so, what commands did you use to create it?\r\n- If you `rm -r /var/lib/rethinkdb/default` and run `service rethinkdb start`, what happens?"
