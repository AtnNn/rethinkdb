      "@ekanna if you don't mind me suggesting, I think posting these questions on StackOverflow and tagging them with rethinkdb would benefit more people than opening them as issues on Github. We'll answer them but on StackOverflow there will be more people that will be able to find them, while here once closed they'll be lost with other hundreds and hundreds of other code related issues we are continuously closing.\r\n\r\nActually, we'd really appreciate if you could migrate to StackOverflow the last couple of questions you've asked so we preserve them for other users. Thanks a lot"
