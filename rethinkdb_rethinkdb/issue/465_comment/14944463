      "Thanks guys for educating me on this. This is lack of awareness on my side where to post and what. Sorry for the trouble. In fact, i checked your wiki home page for this project to know where to post and what. But there is nothing mentioned in your wiki home page. And i did not further check on your site home page where you have mentioned google groups.\r\n\r\nMay be you can update your wiki home page also, some thing like below, so that new comers like me won't commit this type of mistakes again.\r\n\r\nFor discussions: googlegroups/rethinkdb\r\nFor Q & A : stackoverflow  with tag rethinkdb\r\nFor Issues : github/rethinkdb/issues\r\nand whatever other channels you have..\r\n\r\nsorry for the trouble once again."
