      "@ekanna we're very happy to answer your questions but @al3xandru is right. This isn't the ideal formum for \"how do I do this\" questions. Anything posted as a github issue should be an issue to which the fix is code being committed to the repo.\r\n\r\nI'd also just like to make it clear in this issue that copying from one table to another will be a slow operation proportional to the size of the table. There's no copy on write type optimizations happening in the background."
