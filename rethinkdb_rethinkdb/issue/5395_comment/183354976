      "I now think this is intended behavior, because multiple documents could be affected, some with errors others successful. It still confuses me though, because in one case `r.error` results in an error in the other it only kind of does. But I guess it's a philosophical question if the error parameter should be filled if some documents where successful and others weren't. Can someone point to discussion if there was some? Or info on error handling in general?"
