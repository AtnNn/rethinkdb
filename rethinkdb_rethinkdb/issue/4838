        "This was reported in the Addimation channel.  They're getting the `Unable to retrieve the start stamps.  Did you just reshard?` error message long after resharding is done.  There are multiple possible causes for this, but the most likely right now seems to be a mistake in our error handling if your first changefeed subscription to a table happens just as the table reshards.  There are probably three things to do here:\r\n* Improve the error reporting in this case.  There are multiple code paths which produce the same error which could instead produce different ones.\r\n* Visually inspect the logic I mentioned above to see if it's wrong.\r\n* Try to reproduce the bug."
