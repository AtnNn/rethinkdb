      "I just bumped into this.\r\n\r\nUse case: Transform the results of a join.\r\n\r\nI want to do a join, and do something like\r\n```\r\nresultJoin.map( function(result) {\r\n    return result(\"left\").merge({\r\n        fieldName: result(\"right\")\r\n    }).default( result(\"left\") )\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe thing is I want the users to be able to use whatever name for fieldName (so it's a variable). The only way now to do it is to coerce from array to object.\r\n\r\nWhile it works, it makes things quite ugly."
