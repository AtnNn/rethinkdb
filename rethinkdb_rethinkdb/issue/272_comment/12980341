      "@coffeemug in the use case I mentioned, I want to filter on the client side (instead of firing a second query, so it has nothing to do with the array operations).\r\nI want to filter on the client to keep the app fast and responsive.\r\n\r\n@mlucy's solution works for me, even if it's not really nice (not sure if the proposed`r.obj()` is better though).\r\n\r\nReopening because I think @coffeemug didn't really understand the use case, and because I would find really irritating not to be able to do it (more than not being able to do operations on arrays/string)"
