      "Some time ago we made a conscious decision not to put effort into supporting these types of use cases (dynamic attribute shenanigans) because it complicates the language, has dubious benefits, and potentially significantly complicates performance analysis later on. In this case, instead of an object `tags: { tag1: true, tag2: true, ...}`, it would be much much better to structure it like this: `tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', ...]`. You can then query arrays using array operations (which we're working on).\r\n\r\nClosing, due to lack of compellingness.\r\n\r\nShakespearean tl;dr:\r\n\r\nCompelling use case here I do not see,\r\nI therefore this bug will promptly close,\r\nDynamic attributes in general are,\r\nAbusive and uncalled for I should think."
