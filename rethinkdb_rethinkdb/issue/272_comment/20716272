      "The original proposal to fix this issue was `r.object([\"key1\", \"value1\"], [\"key2\", \"value2\"] )`. Is this much better than `r.expr([\"key1\", \"value1\"], [\"key2\", \"value2\"]).coerceTo('object')`? Considering that the syntaxes are nearly identical, I don't think this is very important right now (unless there is a better proposal for this)."
