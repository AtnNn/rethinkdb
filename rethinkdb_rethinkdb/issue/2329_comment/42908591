      "The fix for the \"running out of memory after restart\" problem is in CR 1489 by @srh.\r\nThose changes get rid of `rdb_erase_major_range()`.\r\n\r\nWith these changes I can start up the cluster again. However dropping a secondary index still makes it run out of memory, so the original issue remains and will be resolved in a separate change."
