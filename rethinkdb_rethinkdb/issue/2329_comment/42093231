      "@srh: Only the `reactor_be_nothing` role does that. We want that data to be deleted.\r\n\r\nI've started working on getting rid of `rdb_erase_major_range()` completely. Instead we will erase the region in small chunks through `rdb_erase_small_range()`.\r\n\r\nWe can do the same (split up the erase into a couple of smaller ones) for dropping secondary indexes. Though I will update that after #2251 (if it doesn't become part of #2251 anyway)."
