      "@srh: reactor_be_nothing calls reset_data() on the store subview. This is meant to free up space, in case the node has previously been a secondary or primary for a range that intersects with the range that it's now nothing for. It's not really necessary to do that at every startup, if it has been done before (though that's not the core of the problem).\r\n\r\nThe erase itself is implemented through `rdb_erase_major_range()`. It first traverses all secondary indexes, erasing the entries that have a primary key in the range. It doesn't rebuild them, just traverses them (it being a write transaction, those accesses count as touching the blocks though). It then traverses only the relevant range in the primary btree and erases the values in there as well."
