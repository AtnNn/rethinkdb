      "> Everytime one starts a RethinkDB node with a sharded table, it runs an erase operation over all secondary indexes to make sure that no data exists that shouldn't be there (that is part of the reactor_be_nothing initialization).\r\n\r\nDo you know why we do this?  I don't get why we would do this.  So we rebuild the indices every time we start up?"
