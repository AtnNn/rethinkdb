      "We could instead call `rdb_erase_minor_range()` with some limit on the number of elements each call erases, and then call it repeatedly until everything has been erased.\r\n`rdb_erase_minor_range()` in contrast to `rdb_erase_major_range()` traverses the primary key first, collecting the secondary index keys of the documents it deletes on the way. It then removes only those entries from the secondary index, avoiding a full traversal of the secondary index."
