      "Testing on a 16-core, 32-thread machine, with one rethinkdb instance:\r\n\r\nWith 0 tables, a rethinkdb process apparently has 0-1% CPU usage.\r\nWith 1 table, a rethinkdb process has 1% CPU usage and is now usually ahead of the other processes, except Chrome.\r\nWith 2 tables, a rethinkdb process has about 6-7% CPU usage.\r\nI then added 14 more tables and it stayed at 5-7%.\r\n\r\nIf I make `rebalance_check_interval_ms` be 60, rethinkdb hovers around 2% CPU.  If I make it be 5, rethinkdb hovers around 22-24% CPU.\r\n\r\nThe makes the cache rebalancing theory seem correct.\r\n"
