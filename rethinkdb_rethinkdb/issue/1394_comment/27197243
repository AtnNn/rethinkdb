      "@underrun -- we'll take a look at zeromq and make this work if we can. However, in our tests the cpp backend doesn't necessarily make that much difference in performance. We've put a lot of effort into improving performance by automatically using json instead of protobufs on insert, and will do the same for data coming back from the server. We'll look at other optimizations too -- unfortunately the cpp backend isn't a panacea for python driver performance problems. (We'll still make the install easy if we can, but not at the expense of confusing new users)"
