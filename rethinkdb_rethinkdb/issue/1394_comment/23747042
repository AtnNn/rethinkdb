      "oh! okay ... the ubuntu apt package for python-protobuf has the cpp extension built. when i'm trying to install into a virtual environement, the pypi version of protobuf fails to build the cpp extension. and i get this:\r\n\r\n    *** WARNING: The installed protobuf library does not seem to include the C++ extension\r\n    *** WARNING: The RethinkDB driver will fallback to using the pure python implementation\r\n\r\nI've also tried building building and installing the protobuf python extension from the protobuf source but to no avail.\r\n\r\non the bright side i can use the cpp protobuf extension on my ubuntu desktop but, alas, still not from my gentoo server."
