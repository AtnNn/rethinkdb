      "In RethinkDB 1.11, the python driver will not build the C++ extension by default. It will only build the extension if the PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION environment variable is set to cpp, which is what the upstream protobuf library does.\r\n\r\nDetailed documentation for building the C++ implementation of the python protobuf library is being written: https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/74\r\n\r\nThe current python driver can only build the C++ extension for protobuf 2.4. The new driver will also work with protobuf 2.5\r\n\r\nThe `r.protobuf_implementation` variable will keep the same meaning."
