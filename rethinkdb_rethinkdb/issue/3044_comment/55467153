      "I don't think this is a GCC bug; I think it just can't find the implementation of `render_as_json` for the variant for some reason.  Maybe if we moved the implementation at json_adapter.tcc:374 up, or moved the declaration and implementation out of the `boost` namespace?  (Why are they in the boost namespace to begin with?)"
