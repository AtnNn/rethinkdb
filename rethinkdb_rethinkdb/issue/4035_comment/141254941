      "The description of this issue is pretty outdated. `get_all` has parallelized lookups for a while, and we're making it more performant in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1526 .\r\n\r\nThe way those changes are implemented, I think memory consumption will be about what one would expect, i.e. all keys obviously have to fit in memory, but the results itself will be streamed.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this, since I don't think there's much left to do here."
