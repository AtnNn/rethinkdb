      "I have reassigned this to myself.\r\n\r\nAnother issue with db_term_t is that it uses `const_rethreading_metadata_accessor_t` to lookup the database's UUID, given its name.  The `cluster_env_t` type already has a `databases_semilattice_metadata` field which uses a cross-thread watchable to see changes.  I think the thread switch is worth avoiding.\r\n\r\nThis will probably result in avoiding copying the other fields too."
