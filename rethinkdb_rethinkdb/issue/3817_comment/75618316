      "Thanks for the suggestion.\r\nUnfortunately that is not easily possible because attributes in ReQL generally don't have a defined order (though in practice they're always alphabetically ordered).\r\n\r\nThis is related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3194 . I just added a ReQL proposal to that issue, so we can implement that at some point (but it will probably take a bit until we get there)."
