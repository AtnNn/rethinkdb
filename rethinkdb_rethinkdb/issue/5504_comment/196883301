      "I just ran further tests.\r\nI can create a cluster if the table is empty and nothing inserts any record at the time of reconfiguration. \r\nWriting data to the table after reconfiguration works as expected. the only issue is the connection loss between the servers.\r\n\r\nHope this helps to narrow down the issue a bit."
