      "We can't use Python's `with` to manage a connection stack. In Python `with` means something very specific -- it's shorthand to help people avoid the `try..catch..finally` clauses, and we need to use it for that and respect the convention (basically, what @timmaxw said). That's the scope of this issue.\r\n\r\nAs far as how to do connection management in the REPL, let's move that discussion to #256."
