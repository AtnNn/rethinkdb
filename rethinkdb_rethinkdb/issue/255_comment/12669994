      "I don't remember that conversation. I can't think of any reason why it would be bad to support python's `with` statement.\r\n\r\nOn a somewhat unrelated note, the error message for calling `run()` on a connection after calling `close()` should be nicer. (Currently it's something along the lines of \"cannot call `sendall()` method of `None`\"). Also, `close()` should unset `last_connection` if appropriate.\r\n\r\nAlso, the syntax is actually:\r\n```python\r\nwith r.connect(...) as c:\r\n    c.run(...)\r\n```"
