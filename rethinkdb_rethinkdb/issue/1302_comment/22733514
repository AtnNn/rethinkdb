      "Existing drivers are a good point of reference. The .proto file itself has some inlined documentation. There's also a google group where driver developers hang out and we post announcements about API changes located here. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rethinkdb-dev.\r\n\r\nI'm really excited to see a clojure driver made. I started tinkering with one myself but didn't follow through. If you're okay with it I'd love to help out with development. I don't know a lot of clojure so you might have to put up with my noobness.\r\n\r\nDespite how awesome this is I'm also going to close this issue since we normally reserve the issue tracker for things that could be fixed by committing code to the repo. Feel free to email me at jdoliner@gmail.com if you have any additional questions. And when you get a repo setup let me know. I'd be really eager to work on it."
