      "@neumino, your first point is not really an issue if the user needs to enable the 'silent errors' explicitly. As for the second point, I agree with @jdoliner; it's best if some error value (e.g. 'bottom') would propagate through the whole expression, such that x(\"foo\").gt(1).not() returns 'bottom' if x(\"foo\") evaluates to 'bottom'.
