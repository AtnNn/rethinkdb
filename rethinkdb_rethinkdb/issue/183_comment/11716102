      "Why not default to 'undefined' instead? In JS, null !== undefined (I'm not sure how that maps to other languages), and   any expression where either side equals undefined will evaluate to false (except perhaps for undefined===undefined?).  That means that x(\"foo\").gt(5) will evaluate to false when the attribute 'foo' is missing. For numbers, undefined is similar (but not equal to!) NaN. "
