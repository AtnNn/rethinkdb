      ">I'd like a bit of clarification on what this means. In particular skipping as far as I understand it means skipping the row in question this has a concrete meaning with a filter. That if evaluating the predicate creates such an error this row is dropped. However what does it mean in other cases? In particular what does the following return?\r\n\r\n>```javascript\r\n>r.expr({})[\"foo\"].run()\r\n>```\r\n\r\n`r.expr({})[\"foo\"].run()` should return undefined/nil per the JS (and Ruby) implementation of hash even though Python throws a KeyError. I'm assuming here that JS is the core language for RethinkDB.\r\n"
