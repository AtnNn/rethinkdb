      "@coffeemug I really like your proposal of making this a connection level setting that makes perfect sense and your approach of keeping the API as simple as possible (from the users's perspective) until there is demand from users for other features/options. \r\n\r\nWith respect to throwing an error (returning bottom) I actually think that if you attract a large swatch of the mongodb crowd, which I think you have a very good chance of doing, I have a strong hunch you won't see many requests for this."
