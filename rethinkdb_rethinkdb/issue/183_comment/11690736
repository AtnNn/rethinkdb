      "Could we please consolidate this in to one issue with #27 by adding whatever this has that #27 doesn't to #27 and closing this one. Having 2 copies of basically the same issue is just adding mental overhead. I don't quite understand what this one has #27 doesn't @coffeemug could you clarify and I'll migrate it over?"
