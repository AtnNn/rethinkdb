      "I like the idea of using bottom, but not nesting it or returning it to clients, and having filter skip rows that return bottom.  The documentation for filter can say \"selects all rows where the predicate returns true, ignoring any errors\".  I think in general functions that do a bunch of things should be resilient against one of them failing -- batched updates and inserts already keep going when they encounter an error, for example."
