      "Strictness setting wouldn't affect the behavior of `get`. It would however affect the behavior of `map` and thus of `eq_join`. I'm operating under the assumption that users will be surprised of `eq_join` fails when the table doesn't have a matching value. I think that's the typical definition and the purpose of things like outer and inner join is to handle this situation, errorring will be unexpected though in my opinion. It's keeping this behavior simple that requires the granularity on the backend.\r\n\r\n> I don't know how much of a burden a per-op setting on protocol-buffers is, but if it's a pain, I don't think it's worth bothering with it for now.\r\n\r\nIt's very simple.\r\nEdit: At least I think it is."
