      "#27 proposes specific commands to make dealing with this behavior more comfortable. I think we should reconsider the behavior of the evaluator, consider evaluating missing keys to null, and leaving enforcing to constraints that we might implement later. That's distinctly different from #27, though it does make a `defaults` command less important."
