      "I would prefer having defaults (#27) rather than having this new primitive. Also, I strongly suggest not calling it bottom.\r\n\r\nThe real meaning of bottom in type theory is very different from what you are calling bottom. It is a type that has no value. It is not a value that can be returned, and in a strict language it can not be passed as an argument. Haskell itself, even if it is a non-strict language, does not have bottom.\r\n\r\nA nicer way to name this new primitive with concepts from functional programming is to call it Nothing. It could also just be called undefined and have different semantics than in javascript."
