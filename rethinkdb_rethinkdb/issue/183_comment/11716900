      "A simple solution would be to return false for any comparisons as soon as something is undefined.\r\n\r\nDrawbacks are\r\n- You cannot do filter(x[\"foo\"] == undefined) -- But in thie case they should use .contains(\"foo\")\r\n- The false will propagate, so filter( x[\"foo\").gt(1).not() ) is going to returns results where foo is not defined which might be unexpected"
