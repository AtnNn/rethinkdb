      "We had many, many discussions on this and the prevailing idea was to offer as much convenience as possible without sacrificing safety. We thought that treating missing attributes as nulls could get the user into very inconvenient situations, so we decided to be explicit instead. The current proposed improvement is in #27, which will add more operators that will make dealing with missing attributes more convenient.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do think the current behavior is very annoying and the improvements in #27 may not sufficiently offset that annoyance. We've essentially built a very flexible document model, but designed the query language in a way that makes taking advantage of this model inconvenient. This part of the product seems rather unpleasant as a result. I'm moving this to post-protobuf-improvements so we can revisit how to make this better."
