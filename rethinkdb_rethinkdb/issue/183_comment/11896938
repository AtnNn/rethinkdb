      "Actually having thought about it more I think desugarring to branch is a better idea. A strong argument is that missing attrs can come from different places. In the case of eq_join you can get it if an element of the stream is missing the attribute. This is a case where with strictness turned on you'd expect it to error but if we desugar to an error dropping map then it won't. So it seems like it is a bad abstraction."
