      "> I'd much rather put the database into a \"strictness state\" by passing a flag on the connection\r\n\r\n\r\nI may be misunderstanding this but I think having a strictness state for the database is a bad idea because we'd need to store it somewhere and distribute it to different machines which gets in to all sorts of corner cases. Plus it has the potential to seriously screw you over because someone using the database for an entirely different purpose could change this flag.\r\n\r\nStrictness makes a lot more sense to me on a connection basis (which might have been what you meant I'm not sure).\r\n\r\nWe also should probably return a summary which mentions how many rows were dropped due to errors. Maybe even which steps they were dropped on. This would play in nicely with what we're doing in #194."
