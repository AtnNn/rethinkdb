      "Per my comments in #197 rethinkdb shouldn't throw an error if an attribute is missing. Given that rethinkdb is schemaless and there are no restrictions on the structure of the data that is inserted then querying should assume that missing attributes are not done in error and skip them. With a schemaless db these type of integrity constraints are the responsibility of the application by definition otherwise the DB should require support of a schema to ensure integrity at the write not the read."
