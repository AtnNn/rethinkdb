      "@wojons: On the 1 GB node, you could try manually forcing a bigger cache size. RethinkDB defaults to 100MB on such a system, which might not be enough. You can try something in the range 256-512 MB.\r\n\r\nRegardless I'll try to do more testing later. @wojons: What size do the documents in the affected table have?"
