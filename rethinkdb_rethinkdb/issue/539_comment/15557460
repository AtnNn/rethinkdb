      "This is sort of a complicated topic because `ASC` and `DESC` are special cases that don't really fit into our type system.  I agree that we should somehow document the fact that they're used in `ORDERBY`, though; that's a fairly major oversite.  We should probably add comments above `ASC` and `DESC` themselves as well.\r\n\r\n@wmrowan -- you care the most about the type annotations in the protobuf; what do you think we should do?"
