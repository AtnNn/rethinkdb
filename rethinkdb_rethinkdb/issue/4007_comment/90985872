      "@v3ss0n That's definitely plausible. With hard durability, write performance is bound primarily by disk seek times on rotational disks. Each commit to disk can require an average of 2 disk seeks in that case. Since rotational disks are multiple orders of magnitude slower in this than SSDs, you see these stark differences with hard durability.\r\nWith soft durability, disk seeks are avoided for most of the writes, hence the difference should be much smaller."
