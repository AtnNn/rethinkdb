      "Hi @gjuchault The overhead of a changefeed is going to be very small. The exception is that if you have a high rate of write operations, it will generate a significant amount of additional network load because it needs to send out the change events to the client.\r\n\r\nIn the other extreme, if you don't do any writes, the performance impact of having the changefeed is basically zero."
