      "Ok, this has been approved and merged into next in commits 57c32c3 and 4deb9c2.  Also included some better handling for link-local IPv6 addresses, which were not working correctly before.  With this in mind, I also merged these to v1.11.x in commits 41d7d78 and 69316c3, so they can be in the 1.11.2 release in case anyone is trying to use link-local addresses."
