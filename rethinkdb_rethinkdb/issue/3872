        "Hi all,\r\n\r\nSo, if you open any modal in the web UI (e.g. \"Delete Database\", \"Delete Selected Tables\", etc.), and close the modal by hitting ESC (_instead_ of clicking the little **x**), the page becomes unresponsive -- you cannot click or hover on anything and have to refresh the page. This is because the `modal-dialog` retains a class of `visible` even though its content is emptied correctly.\r\n\r\nHere's a GIF demonstrating the issue:\r\n\r\n![rethinkdb-bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/44855/6476009/99bc1e00-c1c5-11e4-939f-653df7d5ecbc.gif)\r\n\r\nReproduced on latest RethinkDB."
