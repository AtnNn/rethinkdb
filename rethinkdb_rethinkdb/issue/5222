        "`r.minval` and `r.maxval` can currently become a secondary index key, if you return them from a secondary index function.\r\n\r\nWe think that this might break some code and should probably disallow those values to be stored as secondary index keys.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus I think you were using this to emulate \"dense\" indexes right? Did you just need a way to store something equivalent to `null` in an index? Or also a special value to represent \"field missing\"?"
