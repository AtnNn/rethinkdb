      "I was trying to recommend tagging this as won't fix. The code that is throwing an error is the core Python library. Documenting that all string responses should be wrapped in the following block is all the solution I can find:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry:\r\n    s = str(expected_str)\r\nexcept UnicodeEncodeError:\r\n    try:\r\n        s = unicode(expected_str)\r\n    except UnicodeEncodeError as e:\r\n        print(\"This is a malformed string. Data has been lost at {}\".format(e.pos))\r\n        s = unicode(expected_str, errors=\"ignore\")\r\n# use expected_str only after this point through the alias s\r\n```\r\n"
