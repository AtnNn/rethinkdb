      "So I think this is probably not a bug but just a memory issue.\r\nIn a very quick test using the variant without `limit(5000)` definitely used more memory, but I'm not 100% sure if that was actually what was causing the `r.js` worker to terminate / be terminated.\r\n\r\nSince it went away for you @elifarley after upgrading memory, I would like to close this issue unless the issue shows up again.\r\nI'm going to open a separate issue to discuss what we can do to limit `r.js` memory requirements."
