      "@elifarley the `limit(5000)` causes the `r.js` processing to be limited to one CPU core, while without the limit it's being parallelized over all cores. That might have affected memory consumption.\r\n\r\nIn general I do not recommend putting a `limit` into every query, because it will also slow some queries down."
