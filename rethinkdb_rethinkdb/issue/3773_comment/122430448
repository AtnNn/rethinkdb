      "We don't generally have to keep the uninstall script up-to-date. Using `pkgutil` generally gets us around that. The only place where this would be an issue is in things like #4507 where we might have script-installed files (symlinks).\r\n\r\nThe reason that it tries (always unsuccessfully) to delete the given folder is that we actually have `/usr`, `/usr/local`, and `/usr/local/bin` in our package. In most cases we don't create them, but they do remain in our pkg receipt. This is fairly easy to correct by using `pkgbuild --install-location`, and I will be submitting a change for that.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have to make the uninstall script work with existing installed packages, and doing so without trying to remove those folders is going to be a little trickier. We should still use an AppleScript, as that makes authentication really easy, but it will probably involve adding a Python script that that calls to do the heavier lifting."
