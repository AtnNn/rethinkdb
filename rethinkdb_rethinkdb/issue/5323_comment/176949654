      "There are certain ways of making this work by having a special single replica that receives all the data. \r\n\r\nIt is important that that replica is shut down before taking the `rethinkdb_data` folder backup (or that some sort of atomic filesystem-level snapshot is taken).\r\n\r\nAdditional care must be taken when restoring from such a backup for the reasons @encryptio mentioned, specifically a server started from a backup must *never* be allowed to join with other servers in the cluster that still have their data directories. Otherwise the cluster can get in an into a bad state which can lead to crashes and/or data loss.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't generally recommend this strategy, unless there are special reasons that rule out `rethinkdb dump` as an option."
