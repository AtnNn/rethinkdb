        "With larger deployments it might be a good option to provide for \"hot spare\" servers, that is servers that are not assigned shards but are ready to step in and take over for a shard-holding server that goes missing. For instance:\n- in a larger cluster there are 3 servers holding a specific shard on a table\n- there is a fourth server designated as a hot spare for that table\n- one of the three goes down (becomes unreachable)\n- the fourth server automatically steps in and starts backfilling\n\nThis would allow admins more time to deal with a couple of machines that might fall over, and will become more important the larger clusters we support.\n"
