      "Ok, this is up in review 641.  The Web UI doesn't really like the auth_key issue because it expects a UUID for an object, even though we don't have one (I put in a nil uuid in the spot).  It would be useful to have the web ui support resolving auth_key, but I don't think it's necessary for this issue.  I'll open another for that."
