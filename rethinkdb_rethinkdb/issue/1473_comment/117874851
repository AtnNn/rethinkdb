      "As described by @timmaxw above, you could do:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker exec rethinkdb-container rethinkdb proxy --join localhost --join <ip of master server>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately you also need to then kill the proxy with `^C`, or if you are scripting the process, add something like `& sleep 10; kill $!`\r\n\r\nI agree it would be nice to have a more straightforward and less error-prone way of doing this."
