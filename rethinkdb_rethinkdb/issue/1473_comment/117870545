      "@danielmewes The simplest explanation is this line from my docker file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCMD [ \"rethinkdb\", \"--bind\", \"all\" ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't want to have to add a --join there pointing to some static ip such that a) I have a bootstrapping problem or b) I have to change my dockerfile if (when) my primary db server changes.\r\n\r\nIdeally I could spin up a rethinkdb container and then do:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker exec rethinkdb-container rethinkdb join <ip of master server>\r\n```"
