      "@andyburke We're just finishing up the \"Raft release\" (RethinkDB 2.1), which changes how servers are managed internally. We wanted to wait for this to not duplicate work.\r\n\r\nGenerally there doesn't seem to be as much demand for this as for some of the other features, since it's already fairly easy to join a cluster through the `--join` command line / configuration option.\r\n\r\nWould you mind specifying your scenario a bit more by the way? You mentioned in the other issue that this would be useful for your Docker deployment. Is there anything in particular that makes it difficult to alter the configuration file?"
