      "There is a workaround for joining two existing servers together. If you start a third server and instruct it to join both of the existing ones, it will introduce them to each other. You can then shut down the third server since it's no longer needed. If you start the third server in `rethinkdb proxy` mode, then it won't even create any data files."
