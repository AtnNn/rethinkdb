        "Currently `MAX_CONCURRENT_IO_REQUESTS` is configurable at compile time. Due to the fact that it significantly affects `/proc/loadavg` and the fact that `/proc/loadavg` is often monitored by VPS tools (and the VM with a high load is sometimes killed), we need to make `MAX_CONCURRENT_IO_REQUESTS` be configurable for each rethinkdb process as a config arg to `rethinkdb serve`.\n\nAlso:\n- the `config/args.hpp` file still has `TARGET_IO_QUEUE_DEPTH` which is no longer used \n- the comment for `MAX_CONCURRENT_IO_REQUESTS` in `config/args.hpp` says that it is configured on a per-event queue basis, which I believe is no longer true. We should fix the comment.\n\nAssigning to @srh.\n\nEDIT: we should also verify the hypothesis (a strong one, but a hypothesis nevertheless) that lowering this value actually decreases peak loadavg.\n"
