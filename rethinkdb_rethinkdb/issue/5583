        "`./test/run interface.system_changefeeds` (`test/interface/system_changefeeds.py`) uses threads to monitor a number of changefeeds. This tests has been a bit flaky when run with other tests, especially when run while the system is under load, and I suspect it is thread starvation with the Python GIL that is contributing to this. I don't see much value in running these on their own threads, so we should probably switch them back to being run in the main thread to make this test more reliable."
