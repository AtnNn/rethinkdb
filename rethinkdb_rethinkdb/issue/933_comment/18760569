      "Well with the special term you can decide on some rows to multi index and on other rows not to based on the row. Whereas the flag changes the meaning of returning an array from your index function so you could never index on an array and multi index within the same index. That's probably a bit of an esoteric use case but it still seems weird to me to have a flag change how the return value of the index function is interpreted rather than being able to return something different from the function to indicate you want a different behavior. I really like the simplicity of having an index defined entirely by a single function. Also that makes the implementation a lot simpler."
