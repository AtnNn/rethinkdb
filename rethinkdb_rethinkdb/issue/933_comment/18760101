      "Note for people who wish this issue was fixed right now. A pretty good work around for this is to denormalize the data. That is, rather than storing it in an array in an attribute put it in a second table that you join to the first one so your data would look like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable(\"fruit_stands\"):\r\n    {id : 'palo_alto_farmers_market'}\r\n    {id : 'mountain_view_farmers_market'}\r\n\r\ntable(\"fruits_contained\"):\r\n    {fruit_contained : 'apple', fruit_stand : 'palo_alto_farmers_market'}\r\n    {fruit_contained : 'orange', fruit_stand : 'mountain_view_farmers_market'} \r\n```\r\n\r\nThen to get the type of indexing you want you would run:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nr.table(\"fruits_contained\").index_create('fruit_contained')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you could get all the fruit stands that sell apples by saying:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nr.table(\"fruits_contained\").get_all('apple', index = \"fruit_contained\").eq_join('fruit_stands', r.table(\"fruit_stands\"))\r\n```"
