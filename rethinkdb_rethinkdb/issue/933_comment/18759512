In the mean time, I'm going to do what Joe\r\nsuggested, which is more denormalization..\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Fri, May 31, 2013 at 1:31 PM, Joe Doliner <notifications@github.com>wrote:\r\n\r\n> @linuxdynasty <https://github.com/linuxdynasty> requested on IRC being\r\n> able to index in such a way that each document can have multiple secondary\r\n> keys in the same secondary index.
