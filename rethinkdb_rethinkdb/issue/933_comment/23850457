      "How did you choose the word \"tag\" to represent this? It doesn't connect to anything in my brain (i.e. when I think of a \"multi index\" I might get some vague idea of what that means, but I have no idea what a \"tagged index\" means). I think `multi=True` or `type='multi'` is better.\r\n\r\nI don't like the term \"multi\" so much either as it only gives a vague idea of what the thing does, so may be there is a better name, though.\r\n\r\nAlso, what happens if you mark an index as multi-index but on a given record the index doesn't return an array?"
