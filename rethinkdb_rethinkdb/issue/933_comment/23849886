      "I have a working prototype of this up in CR 899 which means we should probably nail down what we want the API to look like. This is a pretty minimal changed right now when you want a tagged index you say:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ntable.index_create(\"foo\", tags=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe could bike shed over what we want the optarg to be called a bit. I like \"tagged\" just about as much as \"tags\". I'm not crazy about just \"tag\" because it reads like a verb rather than an adjective to me. Anyone else have thoughts?"
