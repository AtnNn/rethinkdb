      "To me `multi = True` also seems better than `type = 'multi'`.\r\n\r\nI agree with @neumino that automatically converting non-array values to single-element arrays sounds friendlier, but I would point that it would create an inconsistency with `concat_map`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.expr([1, 2, 3]).concatMap(function (foo) { return 1; })\r\n=> Cannot convert NUMBER to SEQUENCE\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tend to think that for consistency's sake we should change `concat_map` to accept single elements too, unless there are reasons not to that I'm not thinking of."
