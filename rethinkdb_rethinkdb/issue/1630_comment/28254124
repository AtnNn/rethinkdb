      "This is really weird -- I've never seen this before (myself, or reported by anyone) and it's hard to think of a plausible mechanism for how this might happen. Could you describe what sort of workload you're running on the server?\r\n\r\nOne possibility is that you have a process running that tracks resources (memory, disk IO, etc.) and sends a SIGINT if the usage crosses some threshold. Could you check for this?\r\n\r\nHere is something we can do -- the signal handler typically gets a process ID of the process that sent the signal. We can print this ID as part of the message to ease debugging of this issue.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus -- would you mind taking a look at that? Moving to subsequent."
