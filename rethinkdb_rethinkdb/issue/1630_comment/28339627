      "Cool, thank you!\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is relevant or not, but I'll include anyway:\r\n\r\nI noticed something off when I went to update packages in this server. I kept seeing core dump on \r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to revert my status and clear out packages list, still getting same problem. Probably irrelevant.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, in my diagnostics, I did run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd lo and behold, saw the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\r\nSetting up rethinkdb (1.10.1-0ubuntu1~saucy) ...\r\n System start/stop links for /etc/init.d/rethinkdb already exist.\r\nrethinkdb: instance1: The instance has already started\r\n```\r\n\r\nThink maybe this whole issue has to do with a crashed install? Or a not successfully completed install?"
