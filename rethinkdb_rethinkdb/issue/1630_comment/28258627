      "I think it might be likely that Digital Ocean installs a piece of software that monitors resources and sends a SIGINT under some conditions.\r\n\r\nOnce we print the process ID that sends a sigint it will be really easy to diagnose this issue. We're on it. One way to diagnose the issue before we release the patch is to wrap rethink in a script that traps sigints and prints the offending process ID. If you have the time to do it, might be worth a try."
