      "Unary is unfortunately not overloadable in python. I'm not sure about in ruby either. I'm a little bit dubious that `r.sub(1)` should return `-1`. I think it's a lot more likely that `r.sub(1)` is a typo than an attempt to negate a number and I'd like to leave the option open to have `r.sub(1)` be shorthand for `lambda x: 1 - x` in the future."
