      "@wmrowan It appears you can overload `__neg__` I'm not sure why we didn't do that.\r\n\r\nHaving `r.sub(1)` be shorthand for is probably unintuitive by itself but if we had currying in other places in the language it could wind up being really awesome. You could writing things like:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ntable.map({\"foo\" : r.sub(1), \"bar\" : r.add(1)})\r\n```\r\n\r\nanyways, this is outside of the scope of this discussion.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug definitely close this. It's a nitty gritty issue that no real users have run in to and I see no reason to believe it's actually going to make things appreciably better."
