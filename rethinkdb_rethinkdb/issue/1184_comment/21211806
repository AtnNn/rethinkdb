      "@jdoliner I do believe you can overload `__neg__(self)` in Python to implement this. Additionally, having `r.sub(1)` be shorthand for `function(x) { return 1 - x}` seems quite unintuitive to me. Still, I don't necessarily think we should support unary `r.sub`. The usefulness of this seems quite limited."
