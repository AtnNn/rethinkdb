      "It's not my favourite solution, but it's a reasonable proposal and I won't argue against it. I have two comments however:\r\n\r\nWould the new behaviour of `or`, `and`, `branch` and `not` work everywhere and not just inside `filter`? If so, it might be useful to add the `default` optarg to them too. However `or` and `and` are variadic and can't take optargs in JavaScript. #3199 might also make `branch` variadic.\r\n\r\nTo be consistent, it would also make sense to treat non-existence as falsy in other commands that take a predicate, such as `contains`, `offsets_of`, `inner_join` and `outer_join`."
