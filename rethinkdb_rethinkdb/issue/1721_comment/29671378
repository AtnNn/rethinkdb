      "@jdoliner -- for the sake of the discussion here (and my poor memory of the topic), could you remind us what the primary objections are to making errors falsey?\r\n\r\n@coffeemug -- If option 3 doesn't pan out, I think option 2 is our best bet.  We previously added the automatic default to filter because it made a particular class of common query \"just work\", and there was no other easy way to make those queries work without a bunch of `r.branch`ing.  Now, two things have changed: it's become apparent that a bunch of other less-common queries have **extremely** confusing behavior when you add an automatic default, and we now have a relatively easy way (`default`) to make the original common class of queries just work.  In other words, while the original problem would be re-introduced, it would be less of a problem (because the query language has a good way to deal with it now), and several new **really really bad** problems that we didn't foresee would go away.\r\n\r\nEven if people frequently just add `default:false` back to their `filter` optargs, things will still be better because the default will be explicit, they'll be able to see it when they look at their query and form a hypothesis as to why the result of their filter is mysteriously empty."
