      "I am extremely opposed to option 2. Forcing people to add `default:false` in almost every filter they write would make absolutely no sense to novice users, and would still be irritating to advanced users of the system. It only makes conceptual sense for people who understand the system really, really well, and we can't increase the size of this audience without satisfying the other two audiences first. I realize the problems of the flipside case (the irritation when rows get dropped incorrectly) and also realize that changing the semantics would be easier to combat now than it would have been when we first made this decision. I still think that the cost of removing an automatic default in commands like `filter` is prohibitive.\r\n\r\nIf option 3 doesn't pan out (and even if it does), we should consider adding automatic `default` to `any`. It's a hack and isn't perfect, but it's simple and it would take care of most issues people encounter so far."
