      "As a heavy user of RethinkDB, I had to develop a DSL for metrics and funnel API pretty advanced and I must say that the current default was great for it, because in a analytics world, people will send whatever they think it is useful and there is no compromise on schema integrity. The current default never bit me back so I would like to see a real world example that could surprise the user.\r\nOh, and +1 for handling undefined like JS does. Although RethinkDB is not constrained to the JS world, this truthy/falsy thing is something that many developers from other languages are used to since JS, like it or not, is the lingua franca of the web."
