      "> I don't think a system where some of these throw the error and others don't is a good solution.\r\n\r\nI tend to agree, but I'm not entirely sure which types of queries @AtnNn had in mind.\r\n\r\n> Using `default = r.error` by default would be more consistent though.\r\n\r\nSorry, we can't do that. If I had to pick just one thing I learned from the whole RethinkDB experience, it's that `t.filter(r.row['age'] > 5)` *cannot* throw by default if `age` is missing.\r\n\r\n"
