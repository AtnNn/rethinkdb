      ">  Everyone loves the current behavior.\r\n\r\nThat's certainly not true.\r\n\r\n@AtnNn for example mentioned\r\n> Many users have introduced bugs in there code and been very confused because `.filter(foo) == .filter(~foo)` when foo generates a non-existance error.\r\n\r\nI agree that we should make the common case easy.\r\nBut - assuming you actually have missing fields - being asked to add an optarg `{default: false}` to your query that makes you consider for a second whether default `false` is what you actually want doesn't sound too bad to me."
