      "Having r.error be falsey was something we discussed a lot last time around\r\nand dismissed for a number of reasons. I don't see any mention of these\r\nproblems in your proposal @mlucy. Do you have any proposals for how to fix\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nI also think it's crazy for us not to at least think about reconsidering\r\nthe idea of not dropping rows that error. This is one of the few things\r\nthat I've seen people  really pissed off at us about. Its incredibly\r\nannoying to burn several hours trying to figure out why your map/reduce job\r\nis empty only to find out its because you made a typo in a field name.\r\nOn Nov 28, 2013 3:53 AM, \"coffeemug\" <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Thanks for writing up a detailed description of the issue so we can\r\n> finally discuss it!
