      "> @AtnNn which solution would you prefer?\r\n\r\nI don't like any of the proposed solutions. I think there might be a good solution hinging around adding a dynamic evaluation flag that turns non-existence exceptions into null as soon as they get thrown. This would have a lot of implications and caveats that I haven't thought out yet."
