      "Thanks for writing up a detailed description of the issue so we can finally discuss it! I agree that the edge cases of the current `filter` are a significant problem and should be fixed. Here are my immediate thoughts on the specific proposals.\r\n\r\nI think we should take option 1 as the last resort, if we can't find a better solution.\r\n\r\nI don't like option 2. I don't think it solves anything and I think it makes things worse. Most of the time people will enable the default (because that's really what they want in `filter`). Then they'll be back to square one with `any`, except they had to have typed more stuff. I understand your arguments, but I'm still very strongly opposed to turning off default by default (heh) in `filter`. Having `filter` error on missing attributes makes it next to useless.\r\n\r\nI *really* like option 3. It might have some weird implications -- @jdoliner probably remembers it better, so we should wait for him to chime in. Assuming we can get around those, this seems like the ideal option. We definitely discussed this before at length, but decided to go with exceptions. We should go back to those discussions and figure out why to refresh our memory.\r\n\r\nI don't think this should go into 1.12. This is a pretty big change to settle on. We already have another big one in 1.12 (`group.map.reduce`), and we don't have much time before the holidays. I think we should wait until we start planning 1.13 to do this. Moving to subsequent, please yell at me if you disagree."
