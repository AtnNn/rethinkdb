      "I feel like even if we made out `undefined` act more like SQL's `null`, it would still be confusing because we also have a `null` that doesn't act like SQL's `null`, but if we made `undefined` act more like JS's `undefined` we'd be pretty close to JS's semantics on both `undefined` and `null`."
