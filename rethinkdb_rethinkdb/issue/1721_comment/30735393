      "Wouldn't adding a type `undefined` here solve the problem?\r\n\r\nThe argument I heard against adding a `undefined` type is that it's not JSON. I would tend to think that it's fine as long as we don't return it.\r\nIn the worse case, we can just create a pseudo type `undefined`?\r\n\r\nOr maybe that creates some other undesired edge cases? "
