      "> I also think it's crazy for us not to at least think about reconsidering the idea of not dropping rows that error. This is one of the few things that I've seen people  really pissed off at us about. Its incredibly annoying to burn several hours trying to figure out why your map/reduce job is empty only to find out its because you made a typo in a field name.\r\n\r\nI agree that this can be extremely annoying and that we should consider proposals for fixing this annoyance. One way to do it is to have a mechanism that returns a warning about the skipped rows (e.g. `Skipping document with id blah because field foo doesn't exist`). If we could find a way to do it, it would be really nice. We should also allow the user to easily error on missing rows in every command where we drop them by default. There may be other solutions too. However, I still maintain that erroring on rows with missing attributes by default is the wrong way to go -- I think it will significantly increase the frequency of annoyance, and there are better solutions to the problem you're referring to."
