      "(To clarify, despite ambivalence about the exact behavior, I'm still 100% on board with the general idea of just patching `any` to keep going when it encounters non-existence errors to see if it can find a true value.  I think that removes 90% of the confusion and requires basically no work.  If we could manage to settle this for 1.16 that would be wonderful, but I realize it probably won't make it in.)"
