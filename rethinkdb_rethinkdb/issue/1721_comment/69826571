      "> I wonder if we should take this as a chance to simplify any/all behavior in this respect, and make them always return either true or false. I'll open a separate thread to discuss that.\r\n\r\nI would be strongly opposed to that.  The reason we don't do that is that it's common to write code like `val_or_null || backup_val_or_null || default_val` in Ruby (and I would guess a lot of other dynamic languages).  The idea is that if `val_or_null` returns a val, you return that, and otherwise you return `default_val`.  Supporting that use case is about a third of why we adopted the idea of truthy values in the first place.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about this a little more, and I think we should adopt the following rules (which mimic Ruby's behavior pretty closely):\r\n* `or` returns the first truthy value it encounters or, if it encounters no truthy values, the last value it encounters.  If the last value is a non-existence error, it rethrows it (`false` and `null` are returned).\r\n* `and` returns the first falsey value it encounters or, if it encounters no falsey values, the last value it encounters.  If the first falsey value is a non-existence error, it rethrows it (`false` and `null` are returned).\r\n\r\n"
