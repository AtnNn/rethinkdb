      "> If the user does encounter a subtle bug, finding it is as simple as typing `{default: r.error}`.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't sound right to me.\r\na) the user first has to become aware of the fact that it's a problem with filter swallowing non-existence.\r\nb) Some of the user's filters might rely on the `false` default. So just setting `{default: r.error}` globally would make other queries stop working, stopping the user from finding the actual problem.\r\nNow the user has to go through every `filter` in their code and find out which ones exactly need the `{default: false}` and which should really have `{default: r.error}`. But the code might have been written a long time ago, possibly by other people.\r\nIf we defaulted to `r.error` that would make sure that users make that decision at the time they write the query. That is the time where they probably know exactly what they want and don't have to spend much time on the decision.\r\n\r\nI also think many users will appreciate a database that cares about correctness and making sure you don't shoot yourself in the foot once you start scaling up.\r\nIt seems similar to our default to hard durability.\r\n\r\nThe important question seems to be *how* frustrating it is exactly to have the `r.error` default, and how common this case is during early testing.\r\nI don't really know. Though you might have some evidence that it's common?"
