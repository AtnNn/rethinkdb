      "I think that for the first stage, we would keep the exception-throwing behavior (because it would be a pain to change) and just make `branch`, `and`, `or` and `not` catch non-existence errors and treat them like JS treats undefined.  That would solve 90% of currently-existing confusing cases with almost no work.  In the future we could look into making `undefined` an actual value in our type system that can be compared to things."
