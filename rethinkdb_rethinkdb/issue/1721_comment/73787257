      "> Would the new behaviour of or, and, branch and not work everywhere and not just inside filter? \r\n\r\nYes.  You bring up a good point about not being able to add `default` in JS.  I think 95% of what people use `default` for is to make non-existence errors actually error right now (especially while debugging), so maybe it would be a good idea to just introduce a global `non_existence_errors_are_fatal` optarg for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n> To be consistent, it would also make sense to treat non-existence as falsy in other commands that take a predicate, such as contains, offsets_of, inner_join and outer_join.\r\n\r\nI agree."
