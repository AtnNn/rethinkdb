      "Also, as a side note, our automatic default for `filter` is one of the few places where we've picked ease-of-use for a special case over safety and generality, which is a smell.  (Admittedly, it's a pretty common special case.)\r\n\r\nAlso also, I think the semantics of filter's shortcut syntax should stay the same.  `r([{a:1}]).filter({a:1, b:2})` should still return `[]`.  So many new users won't be inconvenienced at all by this."
