      "@coffeemug \r\n>  Sorry, we can't do that. If I had to pick just one thing I learned from the whole RethinkDB experience, it's that `t.filter(r.row['age'] > 5)` cannot throw by default if `age` is missing.\r\n\r\nWhat if we had a special error message for `filter`:\r\n\"Cannot find the field `age` in the filter. To drop elements with missing fields, you can supply the {default: false} optarg to the `filter` term.\""
