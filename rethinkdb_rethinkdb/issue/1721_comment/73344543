      "> our users probably have the most exposure to JS's undefined edge cases, so those edge cases will be less confusing to them.\r\n\r\nI would hazard a guess that most JavaScript users don't have a good model of how undefined works in all cases. If there are simple rules to understand it, I think that should trump matching another language's semantics. Especially since JavaScript's semantics are widely regarded as [nuts](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)."
