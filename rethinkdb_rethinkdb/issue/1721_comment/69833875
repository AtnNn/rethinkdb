      "Since JS is by far the largest language to implement something like `undefined` (and also a language that a lot of our users are familiar with), I would lean toward mimicking its behavior for `undefined` even if there was another one that was obviously better.\r\n\r\nIn this case, though, it isn't at all obvious to me that `undefined || false` should be `undefined` or that `!undefined` should be `undefined`.  (In particular, `!x == x` seems unintuitive to me.)\r\n\r\nIs that behavior just what you intuitively feel should happen, or is there another language with that behavior that you're using as a reference point?"
