      "@neumino -- that's essentially @mlucy's proposal number three above. I'm also provisionally in favor of it. The complication is that it creates ternary (instead of boolean) logic, since every logical operation now has to deal with `false`, `true` *and* `undefined/unknown`. This is how SQL does it, though, and I think this issue won't go away until we do it that way too."
