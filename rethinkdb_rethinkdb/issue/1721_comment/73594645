      "Ok, making `branch`, `and`, `or` handle missing field exceptions like JavaScript sounds pretty reasonable. Though I'd still wish for a way to turn it off.\r\n\r\nI would be much more concerned about trying to apply JavaScript `undefined` semantics globally.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I still don't particularly like these semantics and would like to think about it a little bit more."
