      "@mlucy Note that your proposal is quite different from mine. It treats non-existence as falsey, while mine assumed that it was undefined.\r\n\r\nIn that case I might prefer @AtnNn's suggestion of having a flag to treat non-existence as `null`. It probably needs some more thought, but looks more consistent to me."
