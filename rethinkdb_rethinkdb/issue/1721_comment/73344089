      "I still think JavaScript's semantics for `undefined` are pretty odd.\r\n\r\nWhile you do get `.filter(r.not(foo))` being the opposite of `.filter(foo)`, you also get a lot of weirdness such as `r.not(foo < 0)` not generally being the same as `foo >= 0`.\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of JavaScript is a pretty compelling argument in favor of adopting their semantics, but I would still prefer a more consistent system."
