      "> I feel *extremely* strongly that `filter` should not throw on non-existence errors by default.\r\n\r\nI don't believe we can have a composable and consistent ReQL if `filter` gobbles **all** non-existence errors. Non-existence errors in a non-boolean context are almost always ambiguous when, further up the call stack, they get turned into a falsy value.\r\n\r\n> let's not reopen this discussion\r\n\r\nIt is the core of this issue for me. If we don't address the current behaviour of `filter` all we can do is pile on heuristics to try and fix it."
