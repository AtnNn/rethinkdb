      "@brandon-beacher, have you checked the version of your RethinkDB Python driver with pip freeze?\r\n\r\nThe import/export and dump/restore scripts rely on the Python driver installed. If you're running an older version of the driver (< 1.16.0-2), you should upgrade the driver:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo pip install -U rethinkdb\r\n```\r\n\r\n@Tryneus, is there anything else that could be causing this error?"
