        "It is currently difficult to obtain a list of keys defined on objects inside a table. This operation can however be quite helpful for administrative tools. Implementing such an operation is probably relatively easy; I propose adding a 'keys' operation (json.keys() -> json) that returns an array of keys defined on the object. E.g.:\n\n``` javascript\nr.expr({x:1, y:2}).keys().run() ==> ['x', 'y']\n```\n\nUsing this, it should be possible to enumerate all keys used in a table:\n\n``` javascript\ngiven the following table: [{id:1, x:2, y:3}, {id:2, x:4, y:5}, {id:3, z:6}]\n\nr.db().table().concatMap(function(row) { return row.keys(); }).distinct().run();  ==> ['id','x','y','z']\n```\n"
