      "It's less that people are just expecting RethinkDB to support Java 7, and more that often it's beyond their control to change versions. In the Java thread, it's mentioned that Google app engine supports Java 7 only and doesn't seem to have any plans to upgrade. A lot of enterprise users also have restrictions on how/when they can upgrade that they aren't in control of, but would still like to use RethinkDB.\r\n\r\nAs I said, it's not my top priority, but I would like to support Java 7 eventually. There is every reason in the world for users to upgrade to Java 8 if they want to, so I'm assuming it's not a matter of will, rather circumstances preventing the upgrade."
