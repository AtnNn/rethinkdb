      "Just curious, what are the expected benefits of Netty over regular Java NIO? Since both ends of the network connection are well-understood (since they're open-source and written by the same people), it seems like there wouldn't be many edge-cases to account for. On the other hand, Netty is another source of complexity and performance overhead. "
