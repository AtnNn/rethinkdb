      "Traditional blocking IO with one thread per connection may also be a reasonable choice, assuming there will only be a few dozen connections and they are not opened and closed frequently, though pooling would help with the latter part. This could make the driver less complex and easier to reason about. \r\n\r\nEDIT: 1 MiB per thread for the default stack size might be a little steep"
