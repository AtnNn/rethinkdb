      "I totally get that some people have chosen to stay on Java 7 past it's EOL date, but I don't think it's reasonable to *expect* RethinkDB to write their driver for it. If it's not a lot of work then perhaps it could be worth it, but I think they'll need to make that call.\r\n\r\nGoing for Java 8 will mean that you could support the new Java Time API which would be nice."
