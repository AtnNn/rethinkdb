      "@foliot The first post lists the motivation for using Netty. That being said we have not at all decided on Netty.\r\n\r\nOur current plan is to support Reactive Streams in our API, which I think should work with our current I/O model and doesn't require Netty. See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5345 .\r\nIf we can get away with fewer library dependencies and less complexity that's certainly preferable."
