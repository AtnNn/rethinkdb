      "@mlucy very much in favor of your proposal. As I was working on this in the JS driver, it certainly occurred to me that doing this on the server would make a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I think we should consider generating more driver code from JSON ASTs the way @deontologician recently did for the Java driver. That way tackling and maintaining cross-cutting concerns (that can't or shouldn't be handled on the server) can still be done at a higher level. This might come into play again for something like #1190."
