        "Currently the auto_reconnect instance used to reconnect lost nodes is hardcoded to give up reconnecting after 24 hours. This is not ideal in some scenarios where a user may want to remove a node from a cluster, without having to reset all other participating nodes in the cluster. This patch allows the user to change that value.\r\n"
