      "This conflicts with https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3224, but I think the best solution (ignoring alternative to persist the reconfigure arguments explicitly) is to not even \"guess\" replica and shard counts from the current configuration. So `reconfigure` would always require a full set of parameters.\r\n\r\nNot filling in replica and shard counts has two advantages:\r\n* It doesn't confuse users by sometimes maintaining previous configurations, and other times not. `reconfigure` always generates a completely new configuration period.\r\n* Guessing replica and shard counts from the current configuration clashes with my proposal here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2873#issuecomment-60172654"
