      "I think `rebalance` should:\r\n\r\n- Not fill replica and shard values automatically and require the user to specify these values explicitly. (I know I was of the opposite opinion before, but I changed my mind on this after seeing all the ways in which this can go wrong)\r\n- Still require named parameters (to avoid ordering confusion)\r\n\r\nI think we might want to prefill these values in the web ui, but that gives us a lot more options for UX wizardry that makes it a lot less confusing."
