      "Agreed, I mentioned this over in [#3771 (comment)](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3771#issuecomment-74205974). Another \"pro\" not mentioned here is that this would open up the possibility of making the data explorer language-agnostic in the future. In addition to what @danielmewes said, if `rethinkdbdash` becomes the official driver that would also be a good opportunity for a re-write."
