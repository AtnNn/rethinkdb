      "I think the difficulty with making the dataexplorer language agnostic is\nthat we'd need to create a python/ruby parser and serializer in js. Though\nthere may be simple parsers out there already. I do think it'd be killer if\nwe could do that eventually though\n\nOn Mon, Mar 2, 2015 at 5:03 PM, Marshall Cottrell <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Agreed, I mentioned this over in #3771 (comment)\n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3771#issuecomment-74205974>.\n> Another \"pro\" not mentioned here is that this would open up the possibility\n> of making the data explorer language-agnostic in the future.
