      "I don't believe that we have Python runtime dependency in the server. We do have that dependency for building some components, and for testing (even aside from testing the Python driver). So making it in Python would be a new dependency.\r\n\r\nIf we go down this route I would vote to build it in C/C++ with the V8 engine and whatever embeddable  http server library we want (there are lots of them). This probably would not be that difficult a task."
