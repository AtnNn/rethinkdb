      "> Could hack around having to parse js on the frontend for the data explorer by being a passthrough to the backend js driver.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't quite work since most of the time you have an incomplete query, and therefore can't really call `eval` on it to get the last term.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think it's a good thing to eventually take out with web ui from the server for the reasons mentioned before."
