      "I will probably limit the feature of adding a secondary index to attributes (ie no lambda function, and no compound index) since it's easier to do and it covers 90% of what people want.\r\n\r\nIf someone really wants it for 1.5, I can try to add lambda function and compound index now.\r\nIf not, I'll just open an issue and put it in another milestone."
