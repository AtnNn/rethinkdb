      "Even without secondary indexes, if you create a datacenter and try to set replicas/acks per datacenter, the replica box will be taller than the shards one, pushing the servers assignments down.\r\n\r\nI could match the heights of shards to the two others boxes, but I just tried and it will weird.\r\nRemoving the server assignments would be one solution -- but not that good I guess -- or we could move it in another view, but that would be some work.\r\n\r\nI don't really have a good solution for this behavior. I'll try to think about it."
