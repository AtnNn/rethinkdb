      "The reasons why we want this feature is\r\n- indexCreate/indexDrop/indexList are not methods that people will often use and therefore not really know about, so just clicking on a button and writing and attribute is easier and more user-friendly.\r\n- People using MySQL don't really write commands to build a secondary index, most of them just use a tool like phpmyadmin/mysql-admin/etc. to do it (at least that was the case for me)\r\n- Since secondary indexes are a big/nice feature, it's better to be able to present it with just a screenshot than with a rql query"
