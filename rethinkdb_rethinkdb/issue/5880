        "I known RethinkDB server is using Raft protocol for clustering, but it seems \r\nthe client driver (at least Java Client Driver) is not ready for Raft failover scenario, e.x:\r\n\r\n(1).when primary node crashes, the client does not connect to other node randomly to retry.\r\n(2). when primary node returns error about replica node, the client does not retry.\r\n\r\nSo, i suggest add following functionality to client driver:\r\n\r\n(1). Allow connect to multiple host.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconnect( host1:port1, host2:port2, host3:port3 )\r\n``` \r\n\r\n(2). Allow retry when network error or node error.\r\n"
