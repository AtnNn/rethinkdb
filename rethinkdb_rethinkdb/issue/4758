If it was an attempt to modify, the \"\r\n    \"modification did not take place.\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe source of this is a `failed_table_op_exc_t`, but contrary to the error text, the cluster was fully available during this time, and no disconnections were seen in the logs.  A `ReqlInternalError` should not be returned to users during normal operation, so either the error needs to be changed or we need more error handling somewhere.  This exception can be thrown from 5 places:\r\n\r\n`clustering/administration/tables/generate_config.cc:290` - `table_generate_config(...)` when generating a config for a table that shows as disconnected through the `table_meta_client_t`.\r\n\r\n`clustering/administration/tables/split_points.cc:109` - `fetch_distribution(...)` when the `distribution_read_t` throws a `cannot_perform_query_exc_t`, but the `table_meta_client_t` does not indicate that the table has been deleted.\r\n\r\n`clustering/table_manager/table_meta_client.cc:561` - `create_or_emergency_repair(...)` when no business cards could be found for any of the servers involved with the new config for the table\r\n\r\n`clustering/table_manager/table_meta_client.cc:772` - `retry(...)` just rethrows `failed_table_op_exc_t` after all attempts failed, ignore this one.\r\n\r\n`clustering/table_manager/table_meta_client.cc:789` - `throw_appropriate_exception(...)`, which is used in several places to throw a `failed_table_op_exc_t` if the table is known to exist, and a `no_such_table_exc_t` otherwise.  Mostly after a `get_status` call fails, and once in `set_config` if no leader can be found for the table being changed."
