      "For posterity, here is a more detailed explanation of what happens with the name:\r\n\r\n* A server is started\r\n* The server checks if it needs to initialize its data directory\r\n  * If the data directory doesn't exist:\r\n    * The server creates a default data directory\r\n    * The server constructs its metadata, using parameters passed at startup, including `--server-name`\r\n    * If no `--server-name` was specified, a random string based on the hostname is used\r\n    * The server writes this metadata to its `metadata` file\r\n  * If the data directory does exist, its `metadata` file is loaded, this overrides what was passed in `--server-name`\r\n* The server may or may not connect to other servers in the cluster\r\n* Metadata is exchanged with other servers, and will be merged using timestamps to resolve conflicts\r\n* Now, we delete the server\r\n* The server is erased from the metadata on all servers in the cluster, this includes its server name\r\n* Even if removed from the cluster, the server will recognize itself as a ghost, but it does not know its true name\r\n* I cry every time."
