      "The data isn't persisted now, we would have to add handling for that.  But we could recognize `identifier_format` and show `__deleted_server__`, which is what we show in other parts of code referring to the name of a deleted server (mostly just issues and log statements regarding intra-cluster connections).  That wouldn't be much use to users, though."
