      "Thanks @nelsonic, we indeed forgot to update that link when our listing changed (this was necessary when AWS switched to HVM virtualization instead of para-virtualized instances).\r\n\r\nThis particular page is in our \"docs\" repository. I just fixed the link here https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/commit/d793ce97037c0c1a18212c786cde063f18147b7a . It will be pushed online with the next deploy of our website."
