      "@neumino I tend to think of an `Observable` as a `Promise` that can be fulfilled multiple times. Promise-based APIs have always struggled with the limitation that you can only resolve a single value and I think solving that problem is the main idea behind observables.\r\n\r\nIf you think about it that way, they totally makes sense as a generic cursor replacement. I haven't seen anyone using them in Node yet either, though."
