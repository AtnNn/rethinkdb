      "There's also one drawback of Observable \8211 the current most popular implementation (RxJS) doesn't provide any backpressure mechanism ([although there is a spec for that](https://github.com/jhusain/asyncgenerator#the-asynchronous-observable)). It's basically only great for subscribing to changes. You wouldn't be able to query whole table and consume the results at your own pace.\r\n\r\nOther alternative worth looking at would be [ECMAScript Streams](https://github.com/whatwg/streams)\r\n"
