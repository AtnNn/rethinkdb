      "@deontologician already standarized with [Reactive-Streams](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.0/README.md#specification) and RxJava 2 is already compliant. \r\nbut as @coffeemug said, getting an observable is trivial:\r\n`var observable = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(query.run(conn), 'data');`\r\nI would totally go with this approach for changefeeds. Looking forward to play with this awesome db."
