      "@lrn2prgrm `Observable.fromEvent` won't automatically close the cursor on unsubscribe and won't repeat the query after a resubscribe. It only adds/removes the event listener.\r\n\r\nFor example the `.retry(N)` and other operators whose job is to automate resubscribing wouldn't work as the programmer probably expects.\r\n\r\nTo truly benefit from the change it would make the most sense to get rid of `.run(db)` completely. It's the Observable's job to start/stop/restart the query at the right times."
