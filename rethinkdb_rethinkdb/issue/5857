        "I was talking @danielmewes and apparently implementing #4629 could make this easier to do. The motivation is to be able to determine if a document changed without having to store a version field in the document explicitly (**cough cough** `$hz_v$`). Since the timestamps (may? always do?) change during resharding, this would be a conservative method to check for changes, but that's probably fine.\n\nThe strawman api would be a `.version()` term, accepting no arguments. It would raise an error on anything that isn't a `selection<object>`\n\nI don't know what the timestamp format is, or whether it has any natural representation, but I assume in the worst case we could map it to a uuid or base64 blob or something.\n"
