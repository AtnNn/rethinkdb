        "Our Ruby YAML test \"driver\" (grrr) tries to use a `binding` to help contain the testing and make debugging easier [1], however the `binding` in this case points to the main namespace making it a bit worthless [2].\n\nThe fix for this is to do the `binding` inside an instance of a class setup for this ([see the Ruby docs on this](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Binding.html)). However, that is going to require some playing around to get everything needed inside that space linked in properly.\n\n[1] The other \"driver\"s (grrr) do similar things to good effect.\n[2] See the following code:\n\n``` ruby\nbob = 'alpha'\nsmith = binding()\neval(\"bob = 'umbra'\", smith)\nputs(eval(\"bob\", smith))\nputs(bob)\nbob = 'beta'\nputs(eval(\"bob\", smith))\nputs(bob)\n```\n"
