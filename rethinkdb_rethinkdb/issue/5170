        "_typeOf_ is great but it requires a round trip, I would love to be able to pass a ReQL expression to a function which can return if the query will result in an _Object_ or _Sequence_ without the need for a round trip. \r\n\r\nI have a series of utility functions throughout my application and I find myself having to write two versions of each function based on if the query will return an _Object_ or a _Sequence_. \r\n\r\n"
