      "Quick question @thelinuxlich :\r\n> Now that I noticed the huge performance difference between querying by primary key and by secondary index\r\n\r\nI think that's only the case if there's a `.count()` behind the `between` right? Or could you see the same effect in other queries as well?\r\n`count()` is special because it doesn't require loading the actual document data if the `between` is based on the primary key. We could optimize this for secondary indexes as well. It shouldn't require any deeper architectural change I think."
