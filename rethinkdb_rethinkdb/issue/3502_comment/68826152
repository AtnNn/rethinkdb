      "@kofalt, he's talking about using the primary key to ensure some other data is unique other than the actual key. So say you want the first_name and last_name fields to be unique, you could put it into the primary key with an array:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table(...).insert({id: [first_name, last_name]})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would work, and you can ensure that no two users have the same first and last name since RethinkDB provides uniqueness guarantees on primary keys, but you can't update either one of these values in a document"
