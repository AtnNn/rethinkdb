      "@vivekp --\r\n* What's your cluster setup??  How many nodes, how many shards, how many replicas, how many write acks?\r\n* Are you using hard or soft durability?\r\n* Are you issuing point writes or batch writes?\r\n* How big are the documents you're inserting?\r\n* What's your total write throughput when CPU utilization is at 100%?\r\n* I don't know much about EC2; is there an SSD underneath RethinkDB, or a rotational drive?\r\n* Are you opening one connection per write, or doing them all over the same connection?  If the former, are you closing old connections?\r\n* Are you running RethinkDB and the clients on separate machines?  If not, what's the CPU usage of the clients?\r\n* What's the exact query the clients are running?  An insert, an update, a replace?\r\n\r\nSorry for the barrage of questions, but this will make it much easier for us to track down the problem."
