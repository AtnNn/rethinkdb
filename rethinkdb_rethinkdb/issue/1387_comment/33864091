      "I'm having difficulties reproducing this. I'm not getting more than 20-30 % CPU utilization on a 2 or 4 core machine when inserting documents of about 200 KB to 1 MB (soft durability, noreply).\r\nI haven't tried it on an EC2 node yet.\r\n\r\nThe throughput I'm seeing is about 50-60 inserts/s with RethinkDB 1.8\r\n\r\n@vivekp could you provide us with an example document?  Do your documents have nested objects and/or arrays? Also, how much data did you have in the table when you observed the high CPU utilization? Was the table empty or did it already contain a lot of data?\r\n\r\nIn general, 100 % CPU utilization should be expected when running queries with soft durability and noreply. There is nothing wrong with that. However the query throughput seems to be a little low to warrant that much CPU usage. Also @vivekp  mentioned that the throughput was lower at the times where the CPU utilization was high."
