      "@neumino Thanks for letting me know about the fixed bug with python rethinkdb package. I will try to install the driver with protobuf library that uses C++ backend. However, in my case the clients are running on a different machine from the server. Is the cpu utilization issue on the rethinkdb server still related in anyway to that? Do I need to install protobuf with optimized C++ backend on server too?"
