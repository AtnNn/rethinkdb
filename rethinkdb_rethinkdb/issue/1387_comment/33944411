      "@danielmewes I moved away from @rethinkdb 4 months back. We rewrote our infrastructure that was using it and moved to a relational database. The issues were multiple, including high CPU utilization while inserting documents and rethinkdb server being killed under high load. I don't have much pointers now but I will try to answer few of your questions.\r\n\r\nThe documents had nested objects. The table size was about 5 GB. I was using soft durability with noreply mode. The query throughput was low when large number of documents were being inserted. More troublesome issue was rethinkdb server crashing under high load."
