      "> Since the insert/update is in the noreply mode, how can I check the write throughput on rethinkdb server? Also, whenever the CPU utilization is at 100%, the read operation (filter/get/get_all, etc.) from rethinkdb gets extremely slow.\r\n\r\nYou can see throughput for the whole cluster by looking at the web UI on port 8080.  (I would guess throughput is very low here.)\r\n\r\nAm I right that you only get the spikes in CPU usage when you have multiple workers connected?  If so, this may be another incarnation of #1350.  Does the performance change if you reduce the number of shards?\r\n\r\nThe spikes might also have something to do with the soft durability + the rotational drive -- maybe we're building up a backlog of writes, and then pegging the CPU somehow while we flush them all to disk?  Knowing the write throughput when the CPU is low vs. when it's high would help prove or disprove this hypothesis.  Would you mind checking that in the web UI for us?\r\n\r\nThanks for being so patient while we try to debug this.  Hopefully this (and similar performance problems) will be a thing of the past in a few more versions.  (Also, just a heads-up, there's an issue -- #1388 -- open about noreply writes used in conjunction with the \"one connection per write\" workload.  Separately from this issue, you might want to check that your writes are actually getting through.)"
