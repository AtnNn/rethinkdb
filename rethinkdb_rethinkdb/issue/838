        "It seems that there currently is no easy way to do pivot/unpivot operations in ReQL. These operations are really useful when working with data sets such as network data (to convert back and forth between adjacency matrixes and tie lists). \r\n\r\nAn unpivot operation creates id-key-value pairs from objects, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n[{id:1, x:2, y:3}, {id:10, x:20, y:30}, {id:100, x:200, y:300}] \r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```javascript\r\n[{id:1, k:\"x\", v:2}, {id:1, k:\"y\", v:3} ....]\r\n```\r\nA pivot operation is exactly the opposite (e.g. it groups key-value pairs to create larger objects). It is different from a grouped reduce operation, as it uses an attribute's value to determine the resulting column name (e.g. the 'k' attribute determines where the value from 'v' should be placed). Syntax could be something like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('foo').unpivot('id', 'k', 'v')\r\nr.table('foo').pivot('id', 'k', 'v')\r\n```"
