        "@neumino's rethinkdbdash has a lot of interesting features that our official JS driver doesn't currently provide.\nAmong them:\n- Support for node streams (readable and writeable), would solve https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3600 \n- Written in pure JavaScript, making it easier for many developers to understand and contribute to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/766\n- A connection pool\n\nThere are a few things that we would need to change to be consistent with our other drivers:\n- not automatically coerce streams to arrays\n- think about whether we want to keep the connection pool (in its current form). See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/281 (Probably we should just keep it. Even if our other drivers won't have one at first, it seems to be extremely useful in a node.js environment)\n- add a HTTP connection for the Data Explorer (_edit_)\n- rename the module\n\nSo we would probably have to fork it, but should make a serious attempt at diverging as little as possible to allow future patches to be shared between the projects.\n\n(There might be some other differences to our official driver that I'm not aware of / forgot to mention.)\n"
