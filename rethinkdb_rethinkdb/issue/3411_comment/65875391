      "Hi Daniel,\r\n\r\nI haven't tried again, but I certainly can, possibly with some\r\ndifferent parameters (durability)?\r\n\r\nThere is a certain amount of constant load (primarily inserts) \r\non the server, which usually amounts to 0-5% CPU. The 50%\r\nCPU usage was definitely correlated with the `delete`. \r\n\r\nAll of the other writes are hard durability, and they're hitting\r\nthe table being deleted as well as other tables in the db. It's\r\nall of these writes that ended up timing out for us. Things \r\nwent back to normal when I killed the process that had the\r\nconnection that was running the `delete`. "
