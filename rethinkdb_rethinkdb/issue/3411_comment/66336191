      "@sctb thank you for the experiment! The result is somewhat surprising, but maybe the cache wasn't warmed up do the same degree or there were other fluctuations (according to Amazon r3.xlarge and m3.xlarge should have the same CPU power). In any case it seems like the specific node is not the issue here.\r\n\r\nJust to make sure: The `limit(5000).delete()` results you posted have a query profile attached. Are you sure it was disabled for the full table delete?"
