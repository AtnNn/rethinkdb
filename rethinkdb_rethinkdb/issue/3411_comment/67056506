      "I ended up using the batch approach throttled to the \r\nmaximum tolerable slowdown to the production writes, \r\nwhich I ran over a couple of days. Inserting data back \r\ninto the table that I had deleted from did not seem to \r\nshow the same effect (i.e. I was able to re-import the \r\ndata that I had deleted much quicker and without \r\nslowing down the production writes).
