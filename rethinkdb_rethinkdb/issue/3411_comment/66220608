      "Do you know if the node kept having 40-50% CPU over the whole period the `delete()` was running? I'm asking because the 45 minute runtime for the delete is pretty suspicious to start with, so I wonder if it itself got stalled at some point.\r\n\r\nI tried the experiment with five secondary indexes, but still couldn't reproduce it unfortunately.\r\n\r\nYou mention that the writes in question usually take 0.5-1s. That sounds pretty long. Are those just plain inserts of individual documents are something bigger / more complex?\r\n\r\nWe also thought that you could just have ended up on a slow EC2 node. We've had cases ourselves a few times where a freshly allocated EC2 node would occasionally not work properly or be underperforming. I realize it might be quite a hassle to set up, but do you have a chance to try this out on a second instance?\r\n\r\nAre you on Pioneer? I'd be happy to come over some time this week so we could investigate the issue together."
