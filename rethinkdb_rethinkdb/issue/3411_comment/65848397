      "Thanks, I could get a ~70s stall with query profiling enabled (in fact the whole server would freeze). This is because of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3218 , which makes the generated profile gigantic.\r\n\r\nI cannot reproduce the problem locally without profiling. Will try on EC2 next, maybe there's something special about our interaction with their storage.\r\n"
