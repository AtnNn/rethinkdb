      "Thank you for the report @sctb. That sounds pretty bad.\r\n\r\nA couple of questions:\r\n\r\nWere you running the other requests on separate connections?\r\nWere any timeouts triggered when you tried to run the additional requests, or did they simply never finish?\r\nDid you try accessing the web UI during this time? Was ist still responding?\r\nWhich server and operating system did this happen on?\r\nIs it possible that RethinkDB went into swap?"
