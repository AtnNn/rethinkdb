      "CPU increased immediately and stayed consistently high\r\nthroughout the delete, but it's the RethinkDB process, not \r\nNode. \r\n\r\nI have a slow process running right now that deletes 1000\r\nrows at a time, then sleeps for a few seconds before \r\nrepeating the process. I've found that if I don't sleep at all\r\nthings end up getting backed up. I've had this experience\r\nwith inserting bulk data from disk as well, I wonder if it's a\r\nsign that the EC2 and EBS environment isn't up-to-snuff. \r\n\r\nI meant to say that the round-trip request to the web service\r\nusually takes 0.5-1s, not the write to the DB. A single query\r\nwill usually insert tens to hundreds of rows (sometimes \r\nthousands), and most of our tables have at least 2-3 \r\nsecondary indexes. \r\n\r\nI can certainly experiment with another EC2 instance \8211\160I'll\r\ngive it a shot. \r\n\r\n@danielmewes I'm in our SF office normally, but I can let\r\nyou know the next time I'm in MV \8211\160thanks for the help so\r\nfar!"
