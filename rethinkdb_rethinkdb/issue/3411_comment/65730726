      "- Yes, the table was being deleted from a separate connection from production requests\r\n- I'm not sure whether they were timeouts or didn't finish\r\n- We're not running the web UI on this instance\r\n- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on EC2 r3.xlarge and the RethinkDB 1.15.2~0trusty package\r\n- I don't have swap enabled on that machine, so the process would've been OOM killed if that were the case, I think\r\n\r\nI ended up killing the connection that made the deletion \r\nrequest in order to restore things back to normal.
