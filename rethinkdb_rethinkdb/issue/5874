        "My understanding is that it's currently equivalent to a filter on the entire jobs table (this is second-hand info related to me by @Tryneus from @VeXocide, so correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nThere were a few places in the webui I was tempted to create a changefeed on a job id, and we also had that temptation yesterday in horizon as well. The use case is around detecting if other clients have died, and it'd be nice to get pushed a notification that their job has left the table.\n"
