      "`.between.changes` can be implemented efficiently without that much more work (a lot of the infrastructure is in the existing CR).  The big difference between `between` and `filter` is that `between` only has to get sent to a subset of the shards if your range is on the primary key.\r\n\r\nThe main reason to implement `.between.changes` and `.filter.changes` efficiently is that it lets us implement `.between.orderby.limit.changes` and `.orderby.filter.limit.changes`.  (We can't do those with post-filtering on the server handling the query because the shards need to know how many rows to send us and whether to read more rows off disk.)"
