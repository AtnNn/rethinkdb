      "`.between().changes()` can be orders of magnitude faster if we specialize it. And I think this could be very useful for certain applications. For example, suppose that I have primary keys of the form `[blog_id, post_id]` and I want to find out about all changes to any posts in a specific blog. With specialized `.between().changes()`, I can do this efficiently; but `.changes().filter(...)` will stream all the changes, not just the ones related to that `blog_id`."
