      "On further thought, this logic can also apply to `.filter().changes()`. If the filter sits at the B-tree and watches each change as it happens, then only sends the changes that pass the filter across the network, this could be much more performant than streaming all the changes and filtering them afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut maybe the performance benefits aren't large enough to justify the extra code path. I don't know."
