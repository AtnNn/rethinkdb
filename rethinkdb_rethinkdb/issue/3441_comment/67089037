      "I run `/test/run` interactively on a daily basis. Some of the proposed changes would be inconvenient for me. In particular:\r\n* I like the fact that `/test/run` currently puts the test output in `/test/results` by default, so it doesn't pollute my working directory. I propose we keep that behavior.\r\n* If I run the tests several times, I need a quick way to see which output directory corresponds to the latest run. Right now I can do this by clearing the output directory before running the test, or by looking at the timestamp in the filename. Ideally, I'd actually want the test driver to symlink `/test/results/latest` to the newly-created directory.\r\n* I like the fact that each test's stdout/stderr is in its own file in its own directory. It saves me from having to wade through irrelevant output from non-failing tests to find the output from a test that failed. I propose that we keep this behavior.\r\n* Often I debug something by adding print statements and then re-running the test. If the test framework discards server stdout/stderr, I wouldn't be able to see the output of my debug statements. I propose that we add a `--minimize-artifacts` flag to the test runner, and keep stdout/stderr unless `--minimize-artifacts` is explicitly specified."
