      "When I run the tests I also frequently delete the contents of the `results` directory. The main reason for me is the fact that I cannot tab-complete straight into the latest test results if there are multiple ones in there.\r\nIf there's a `latest` symlink, I would probably not bother deleting old results anymore. I probably wouldn't mind if it only kept the last run by default either."
