      "@larkost:\r\n\r\n* `./testresults/<autogenerated name>` would work for me.\r\n\r\n* I misunderstood what you meant by combining stderr/stdout. I thought you were going to combine all the tests' stderrs and stdouts together into a single file. I'm perfectly fine with each test combining its stderr with its stdout,\r\n\r\n* By \"the usual cases for running the tests\", you mean the nightly builds, right? The reason I suggested that the default should be keep is that it's easier to add a flag once to the script that runs the nightly build than it is to type the flag every time I run the tests interactively.\r\n\r\nNow that I think about it, I could always just alias `run_tests` to `../test/run --keep-artifacts --output-dir=../test/results` or something in my `.bash_profile`, so it's not super important what the defaults are as long as they're configurable."
