      "@timmaxw:\r\n* I do want to have the results be relative to `pwd`. Would a compromise of './reuslts' (or something like `./testresults`) being the base directory work for you? That would keep the disruption to a minimum.\r\n* A maintained symlink is a great idea.\r\n* Separating stderr/stdout means that it is at best difficult to see the order that they came in, or how they interleave. I have (elsewhere) seen lots of places where this becomes an important problem.\r\n* I forgot to add another line about having a switch the opposite of what you are proposing. The default should be to discard, as the usual cases for running the tests don't need those (they are redundant to the log), and only specialized cases do need them. Eventually we are going to be keeping lots of results, and the less duplication the better, and the log files are clearly superior for many things."
