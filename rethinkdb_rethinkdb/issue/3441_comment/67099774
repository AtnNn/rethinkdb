      "We have a separate issue for cleaning out results directories: #674. @danielmewes @timmaxw, if you have strong opinions on that please comment. I expect that to be somewhere later.\r\n\r\nBut the one place where that crosses over here: if we are going to have auto-management then we could go with something like numbered directories, so you would have (almost) explicit ordering. That would not be too hard/expensive to implement.\r\n\r\nThe only down-side is that I would have to default to a fixed number of digits for sorting purposes. So either 2 or 3, and put leading 0's on them."
