      "Oh. I usually run the tests with `rm -rf ../test/results/* && ../test/run my_test`, so I don't especially care if the artifacts take a few gigabytes of disk space. For some reason I was assuming that everyone else did something similar, so I thought that the output size only mattered for the automated tests. What if we make `./run` destroy all but the latest (or latest few) test output directories by default, unless an explicit flag is specified, and then make the tests produce lots of artifacts by default? It seems like that's ideal for the interactive use case. But I don't really understand the motivation for keeping multiple output directories in the first place, so maybe I'm missing something."
