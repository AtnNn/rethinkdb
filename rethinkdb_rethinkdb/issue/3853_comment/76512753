      "So with thinky I let people do batch inserts:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nModel.save([doc1, doc2, doc3]).run()\r\n// ~= r.table('data').insert(doc1, doc2, doc3, {returnChanges: true})\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the query comes back, I create instances of the model using what is in `changes`. Since it doesn't come back in the same order, I may return `[doc2, doc3, doc1]` which is not super friendly.\r\n\r\nThe current field `generated_keys` enforce an order if I'm not mistaken so maybe the server could use that? While it would be nice for thinky, no one complained so far (or no complains reached me ^_^) so I guess it's not that important.\r\n\r\nAlso Slightly related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3074.\r\n"
