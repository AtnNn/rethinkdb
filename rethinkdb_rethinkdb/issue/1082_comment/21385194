      "@wmrowan -- that example doesn't work because you're trying to store the database in a variable, which we don't allow right now.  Our general rule is that you can only pass datums to a function, but that you can return anything from a function.  We could let people store databases in variables without too much trouble, but if we let them store tables or functions it would require some major changes to our evaluation model."
