      "Ok -- as far as I can tell, `tableCreate` uses the same connection as `insert` (the zeroth connection) and is chaining the callbacks properly, which suggests to me a server bug. Again, not 100% sure, but likely in @mlucy's court (are we polling for table creation correctly before returning a result for `tableCreate`?)"
