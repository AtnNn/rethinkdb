      "I can't tell from the backtrace, but looks like it's @mlucy's court.\r\n\r\nAs for the script crashing when you start, what's the error message? You sometimes violate some assumptions (i.e. when you switch connections, there is no guarantee you'll see your last write) and that may be the culprit. It would really help to see the error message here.\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks for writing this test, it's wonderful!"
