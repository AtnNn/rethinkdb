      "Hey @neumino, thanks for chiming in. I don't think this is a problem with the specific query (the updated web interface is great btw!).\r\n\r\nTo clarify a bit what I meant by \"intermittent\": Without having changed any configuration in the cluster for minutes, I can run the query let's say 10 times successfully. The 11th time fails as described. The next time works again and so on. \r\n\r\nI saw the same message another time with a different query (I think it was just an `r.table()`, definitely something simple). @timmaxw mentioned that he had also seen this error once before."
