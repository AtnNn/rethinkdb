      "The query that fails is the \"main\" query for the table view. I believe this happen when we try to retrieve all the indexes. \r\n\r\nThe query checks that all the master are available, but that appear not to be enough? See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3018 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2904\r\n\r\nThere are two possible fix:\r\n- Make sure that `indexStatus` never fails\r\n- Split the query in two (one for the table, one for the indexes) which would be similar to the web admin in `next`. The two calls are currently grouped in `reql_admin` just to avoid doing too many HTTP queries."
