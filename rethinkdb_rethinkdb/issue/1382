        "When performing an upsert on an array of documents there is no way to determine how the documents were added to the table. For example when upserting 3 documents I could get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{'skipped': 0, 'deleted': 0, 'unchanged': 1, 'errors': 0, 'replaced': 2, 'inserted': 0}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can I determine which of my documents were replaced/unchanged?\r\n\r\nA potential solution would be to add an optional argument to insert such as return_keys which would return the document keys instead of number of documents changed. For example when return_keys is set to True insert would return:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{'skipped': [], 'deleted': [], 'unchanged': ['8ee774a4-1dc0-4ba3-82d4-4767f429856d'], 'errors': [], 'replaced': ['c05199ba-674e-4388-828b-4bcc91deb057', '3f90a271-f95b-4646-9139-c5739ff016ee'], 'inserted': []}\r\n```"
