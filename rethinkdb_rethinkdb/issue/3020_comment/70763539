      "The fix for `interpolate_key()` is up in review 2506.  @timmaxw, your analysis was correct, and that fixed the crash.  I also added behavior to strip trailing null-bytes from the key (before clamping), to avoid situations like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkey_rebalance('a', 'b', 0.0) => 'a\\x00\\x00\\x00'\r\n```\r\n"
