      "@mlucy, should the error only be raised on the second time `list(cursor)` is called?  What if the user calls `cursor.next()` once, then `list(cursor)` on a cursor with only one element; does `list(cursor)` return an empty list, or error?  What if the user called `cursor.next()` twice (getting a `StopIteration` exception the second time)?\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure this is doable, but I'm worried about the corner cases."
