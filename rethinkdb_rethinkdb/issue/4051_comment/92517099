      "My humble opinion on this:\r\n\r\n@Tryneus \r\n> should the error only be raised on the second time `list(cursor)` is called? What if the user calls `cursor.next()` once, then `list(cursor)` on a cursor with only one element;  does `list(cursor)` return an empty list, or error?\r\n\r\nThe `list(cursor)` should fail I think. Basically I think `list` should only work if it's called on a completely fresh cursor. Whenever any element has been consumed from the cursor, it should fail.\r\n\r\nIf we can detect this reliably and without hacks like inspecting the call stack, I think that would be preferable."
