      "I don't know Python conventions very well, so I'll take your word on it if you think it's better, but it seems bad to me.  I can easily imagine someone accidentally calling `list(cursor)` twice and spending an hour trying to find out why some other function way far away is getting an empty list (in fact this happened to me), but I find it hard to imagine someone saying \"God dammit, I called 'list(cursor)` twice and got an error instead of an empty list!  That's so inconvenient!\"."
