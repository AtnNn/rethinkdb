      "Actually, homebrew was complaining pretty loud about some problems, and I wound up dumping all of homebrew and reinstalling it from scratch.  Thanks to the complaints of `brew doctor`, I also updated my XCode command line tools to the latest XCode's version.  It could be a change of compiler that solved the build problem, not a change of library."
