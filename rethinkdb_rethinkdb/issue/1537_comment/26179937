      "`copathetic` makes it sound like we're pathetic.\r\n\r\nOne proposed etymology of copacetic is the phrase `coupe-s\233tique` from early-20th-century Louisiana French.  I propose we add unicode support for term names and adopt that, so as to be more globally inclusive while hewing to the American roots of the phrase."
