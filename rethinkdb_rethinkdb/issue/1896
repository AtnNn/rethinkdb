        "This is very strange, some of Sinatra's magic is messing with your ruby drivers magic according to @atnnn in IRC.\r\n\r\nA simple sinatra ``post`` works fine, but, when that post is ran from a test all hell breaks loose and I get the following error.  Also, the object in this error ```Rack::MockResponse``` is actually being returned by the table().get() method.  Very strange. \r\n\r\n```NoMethodError: undefined method `update' for #<Rack::MockResponse:0x00000002034d08>```\r\n\r\n I created this project which isolates this so you can use it to repo and test yourself and hopefully fix.  This bug is a show stopper for a datalayer gem I built that I need to use extensively.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Nogbit/rethink_sinatra_mockbug"
