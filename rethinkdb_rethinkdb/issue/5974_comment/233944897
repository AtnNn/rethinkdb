      "I'm literally clueless. It always fails deleting a folder named tmp folder inside the data folder that is correctly created. Inside the data folder the log file is present with the crash. So it seems to not being able to create folder recursively on the filesystem? Creating that by hand will throw correctly an exception signaling that the database file is not present, but the folder tmp created by hand remains. Don't know why, though. If anyone can have a look at it, i would be grateful."
