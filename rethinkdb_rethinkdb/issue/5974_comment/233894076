      "After two hours of reading, i still don't get where the problem lies, about filesystem traversal. The function nftw(3) from BSD claim to do exactly the same of the Linux counterpart, but it seems that it doesen't, because it claims always to fail with errno 2 - No such file or directory. The headers are identical, which is to be expected since it's a POSIX call. Tried to fix even the segfault changing the memory allocator to system, but it seems it's not random at all, fails always on ClusteringContractExecutor.SimpleTests, might be derived from all the other failures, especially on RDP. \r\n\r\nI think i've bite off more than i can chew, don't know if i can do this alone. I will try if i can understand where the problem lies, hoping for the best."
