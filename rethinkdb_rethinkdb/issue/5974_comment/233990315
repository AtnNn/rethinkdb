      "I relied on the easiest solution, and installed a Debian jail over the FreeBSD kernel, allowing to run the software without having to port it manually. Tried to build my change sets over a OS X machine, fails over fetching protobuf, even if i've changed just the make flag. I would love to have it natively on the system, but i'm not skilled enough to be able to do this by myself. Hope that someone will do it. You can close the pull request, if you desire so."
