      "Of course, but the improperly crash called segfault by me, has been always thrown by the test system executable, the server itself is not able to startup at all for the filesystem bug I was talking earlier. Anyway, the full log including the crash is present at the end of the test log posted above, right at the end where it says core dumped. I've took a look with gdb and printout the stack trace of the crash, but it was literally a bunch of anonymous subfunction call, 30+ functions all with a ?? as name. I think, from what I've seen, some threading/fibers glitch, but as said I'm not skilled enough to say anything conclusive.\r\n\r\nInitially it seems that was happened randomly while testing, for that reason I thought that was some RAM corruption issue, and that's why I called improperly a segfault. Lately however it is being thrown always while doing the test on the log above.\r\n\r\nSorry for the misunderstanding."
