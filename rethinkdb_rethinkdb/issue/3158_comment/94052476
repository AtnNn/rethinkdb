      "@joaojeronimo sorry for the late response:\r\n> Also, what's keeping you guys from making rethinkdb serve it's API over TLS connections ?\r\n\r\nWe'd actually really like to do that. There are different options for this, and we discussed some of them in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3151#issuecomment-58932433 . While that thread is about intra-cluster connections, we'll probably provide the same thing for client connections as well."
