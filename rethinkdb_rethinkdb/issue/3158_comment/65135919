      "+1 for built-in encryption. So far I'm using the following snippet on my node.js clients:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar net = require('net');\r\nvar tls = require('tls');\r\nnet.createServer(function (socket) {\r\n  socket.pipe(tls.connect(38015)).pipe(socket);\r\n}).listen(28015);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the client connects to `tcp://localhost:28015`, which in turn proxies it to the secure TLS connection on `38015`.\r\n\r\nAn SSH tunnel is something else to manage, monitor and make sure its running.\r\n\r\nAlso, what's keeping you guys from making rethinkdb serve it's API over TLS connections ?"
