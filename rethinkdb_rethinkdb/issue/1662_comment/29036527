      "Some more information:\r\n\r\nActually this does not only affect the \"Tables\" page. The Dashboard also sometimes becomes very slow.\r\n\r\nFor me, the web interface already becomes very sluggish when creating a single table with 32 shards (edit: + 2 replicas) on a 32 node cluster. If I open the \"Table overview\" page for the table my browser uses 100% of one CPU core and page redraws become very slow.\r\nThis happens with both Chromium and Firefox."
