      "So the methods `DataUtils.get_directory_activities` and `DataUtils.get_directory_activities_by_namespaces` are used to format the directory in a more friendly data structure.\r\n\r\nNow we have a cache in DataUtils so we recompute a friendly directory at most once every 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nWIth 2 nodes, 10 tables with 32 shards each, the experience was smooth.\r\nWith 32 nodes and 100 tables with 1 shard each, you could still feel a little chunky, but that's because of the `apply_diff` method that has to merge huge objects (the content of `/ajax` is about 1.5MB in this case).\r\n\r\n\r\nCode review by 1055 @mglukhovsky "
