      "So I went a little through the code.\r\n\r\nDataUtils.get_namespace_status create a field backfil_progress that we don't use and that can be expensive to compute.\r\n\r\nJust removing that make the browsing fine. You can still feel something chunky, but nothing close as freezing the interface.\r\nThe result of get_directory_activities, get_directory_activities_by_namespaces could be cache, which would make things slightly better, but for now the most expensive task is related to some DOM manipulation.\r\n\r\nI'll keep digging tomorrow, and see with @danielmewes if he still has his problem with his cluster (I just ran a cluster of 4 machines with 50 tables, and a few tables with 32 shards)."
