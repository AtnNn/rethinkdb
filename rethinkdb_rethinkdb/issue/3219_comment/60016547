      "The problem seems to be that the system include files (specifically `/usr/include/sys/_endian.h`) now define those two macros while previous versions didn't.\r\n\r\nThose macros are defined in the s2 code, but don't seem to be used anywhere. We could wrap them in an `#ifdef` or just remove them."
