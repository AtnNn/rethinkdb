      "Following up on this, specifically in regards to array appends (@coffeemug, email sent) - the issue doesn't appear to be as severe as it first seemed. The slower updates in the profiles were made worse by doing concurrent writes, after I forced the appends to be sequential, the times were much more predictable. That said, once getting up to an array length of 1k-2k, the updates were taking around 50ms each (EC2 instance type c3.large)."
