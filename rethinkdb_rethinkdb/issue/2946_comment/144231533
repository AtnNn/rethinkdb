      "@ember-max -- could you e-mail me at slava@rethinkdb.com? Since the details of your use case might be a bit sensitive, I'd like to take the discussion offline.\r\n\r\nIn general, the alternative (modeling documents via multiple tables and joins) is actually very practical, and we see it in production deployments all the time. Documents inside arrays were meant to be used for small arrays -- if the arrays grow large, we typically expect people to move to a table join data model. That being said, everybody seems to want large in-document arrays, so we're going to look into bumping this issue (no ETA yet, but we're on it).\r\n\r\nWould love to talk more about your use case offline."
