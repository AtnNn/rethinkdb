      "As far as I can tell this is the most recent incarnation of the issue I'm noticing, which is slow array append operations (particularly as array size grows, and made worse when the array is used as a multi secondary index). We are evaluating rethinkdb as a backend for large-scale realtime games, and one of the scenarios we are mocking up is using arrays for various forms of inventory management, where it is very nice to be able to leverage the atomicity of intra-document array count() + append(). The alternative that was suggested on another thread (http://rethinkdb.com/docs/data-modeling/) doesn't seem practical, though admittedly I could be overlooking something. Throwing in my vote for upping the priority, thanks!"
