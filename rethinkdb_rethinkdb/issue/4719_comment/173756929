      "I'm actually running into an oscillatory pattern between nodes here, where both of them keep telling each other that they should become active for a table, followed by learning (from the third node?) that they should actually become inactive.\r\nReproducing this seems easy:\r\n\r\n* Start three servers A, B, C\r\n* Configure table `t` to three replicas\r\n* Shut down C\r\n* Reconfigure table `t` to 2 replicas (this might be unnecessary), then configure table `t` to 1 replica\r\n* Start C back up\r\n* At some chance, C and the other server that's no longer a replica will go into a cycle becoming active and inactive again (watch the log for \"Removing file ...\" messages).\r\n"
