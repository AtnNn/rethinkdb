      "@danielmewes: I think the original reasoning was:\r\n* It stopped us from requiring people to specify a base case if they used `reduce`.  E.g. if you write `r.table('test').group('name').filter(pred).reduce{|a,b| a+b}`, and there was a name where nothing matched the predicate, do you want to et back `0` or `\"\"`?  (Or an error?)  We'd have to make people specify that.\r\n  - Note that it also makes `avg` work, since `avg` normally fails on empty streams.\r\n* It makes `r.table('test').filter{...}.group(...).count` and `r.table('test').group(...).filter{...}.count` behave the same way."
