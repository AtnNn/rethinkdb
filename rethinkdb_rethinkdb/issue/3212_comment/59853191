      "Thanks @mlucy. That makes sense. On the other hand of course in the case of `count`, the base case is pretty obvious.\r\n\r\nOne option could be to allow empty groups after a `filter()`, and only remove those when running `reduce`.\r\nI'm not sure if that's better though. That too sounds like it could be quite unexpected from a user's perspective."
