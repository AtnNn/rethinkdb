      "As one might expect with dates, there are multiple different days to calculate week number (since weeks can be split across year boundaries).  We should use the ISO 8601 week numbering definition for consistency with the rest of our date support.\r\n\r\nThe boost library we're piggybacking on already has a function for getting the ISO 8601 week number, so this is pretty easy.  (Actually, this is a good example of an easy ReQL issue that we could give to someone who wants to learn to add commands.)"
