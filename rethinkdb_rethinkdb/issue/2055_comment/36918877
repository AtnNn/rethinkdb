      "```\r\nThe ISO week-numbering year starts at the first day (Monday) of week 01 and ends at the Sunday before the new ISO year (hence without overlap or gap). It consists of 52 or 53 full weeks. \r\n```\r\n\r\nYeah i ran into this in php before. the slow method is counting back the number of mondays that could have happened before. I use this a lot in my layout. And was going to make a ticket for it right now when i saw this. I think the fastest method is figuring out the day of the year then figuring out the number of mondays from that. which becomes much faster and less thiniking. One thing to also keep in mind is that the week can start in the year before. I think that hapepend this year if i remeber correctly. just depends on how you do the math. "
