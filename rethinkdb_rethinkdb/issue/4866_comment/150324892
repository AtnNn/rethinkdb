      "In this particular case, the incomplete branch history is only detected in the (debug-only) `sanity_check` on the contract acks.\r\nApparently the coordinator doesn't actually run into this when generating contracts.\r\n\r\nIt might just be by luck that the branch with the incomplete history is not hit when calculating contracts here, or we might be stricter than necessary in the contract ack sanity check. No clue which one it is, or why we're getting this yet."
