      "Thanks @timmaxw!\r\n\r\nThe second option sounds interesting because it doesn't require keeping additional state around, and therefore doesn't require any changes to the wire or disk format. That makes fixing this in a point release a lot easier.\r\n\r\nI'll look into that and see if it's enough to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nWould you be available for doing the code review for this some time before the end of next week or are you busy at the moment?"
