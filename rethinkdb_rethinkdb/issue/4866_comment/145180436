      "I decided to also allow release mode builds to continue with missing branch history. They will print an error to the log, but otherwise keep running under the assumption that the latest common ancestor for two versions is the zero version.\r\n\r\nWhile this might make some bugs less obvious, I think it's important for the following reason:\r\nAssume someone runs into the bug described above while being on 2.1.4 or earlier. While updating to 2.1.5 is going to stop the bug from happening in the future, a server with incomplete branch history might already have been promoted to a voter. In that case, the involved servers are going to remain unavailable even after upgrading to 2.1.5, with no obvious way to recover. That's clearly terrible.\r\n\r\nThere's also a chance that there are more bugs related to branch history garbage collection, so I think keeping going even if the history is incomplete is safer.\r\n\r\nCurrently working on the patch for this."
