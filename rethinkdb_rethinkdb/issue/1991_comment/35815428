      "The assertion is no longer correct.  I'll fix this on Monday.\r\n\r\n(Actually, this is an instance of the variant design problem I was talking about before, where if you write `boost::get<T>(&variant)` and `T` isn't a type in `variant`, boost just returns NULL rather than giving you a compile error.  I should just grep the whole codebase for `boost::get<ql::stream_t>` when I fix this.)"
