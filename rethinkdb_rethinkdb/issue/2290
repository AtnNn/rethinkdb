I had to run the delete 100 times once per machine that i had. there was no way in reql to start a few processes with out them all going in the same order and trying to do the same deletes. so it would have been useful to do.\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table().shuffle().foreach()\r\n```\r\n\r\neven if it passes over some of them more then once it would be super fast skip since its using the sindex. but would allow for many delete jobs to easily run at once."
