      "This is implemented in branch daniel_inline_lba . I'm doing some additional testing now.\r\n\r\nI've increased the size of the metablock back to 4 KB so it can contain a higher number of inlined LBA entries. Writing 4 KB instead of 512 bytes should make virtually no difference performance-wise. Is anyone aware of negative side-effects that I'm forgetting?"
