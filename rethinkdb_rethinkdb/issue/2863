      Just
        "In the preliminary implementation of the `rethinkdb.table_config` pseudo-table, we present split points to the user as strings in the internal serialization format produced by `datum_t::print_primary()`. This isn't very user-friendly. We should instead store and present split points as `datum_t`s, and only convert them to the internal serialization format when it's necessary to generate a `blueprint_t`.\r\n\r\nThe biggest hurdle to implementing this is that the distribution read operation that we use to pick good shard boundaries returns us values in the form of `store_key_t`. So we need to implement an `unprint_primary()` method (or something like that) to convert from that representation back into a real `datum_t`."
