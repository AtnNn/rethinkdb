        "Currently we support a limited number of error types. RUNTIME_ERROR, CLIENT_ERROR, BAD_QUERY. It's often unclear what these mean or how to categorize certain errors. We got a request from one user (can't find it at the moment) asking that we provide finer grained error reporting to allow him more options when handling errors.\r\n\r\nWe should use the opportunity of the new RQL implementation to rethink the errors we provide, possibly providing a wider range of error types that convey as much information about the error back to the user as possible."
