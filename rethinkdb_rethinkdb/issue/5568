        "Currently the `toString` method on our JavaScript cursors error (like other methods) when given arguments (it takes none). This does not match our behavior when returning an array (unique to the JavaScript driver), where we act more like normal JavaScript objects and just ignore arguments.\r\n\r\nI talked to @danielmewes on which way we should go on this (make array-like error, make everything ignore, or keep the current behavior) and he decided that we should make all of our `toString` methods ignore arguments."
