        "This is branched from #3940 .  Currently, after the first batch which we return as soon as possible, we always block for `n` seconds when you write `squash: n`, even if we have initial data to send back.  @VeXocide said that it would make more sense to him to send back the initial data immediately and only squash the changes.\n\nFor `.orderby.limit` changes and `.get.changes` I think I agree with him.  The point of `squash: n` is to reduce network traffic, but the network traffic from the initial values will be really small, so it shouldn't matter too much.  I'm less sure what we should do once `return_initial` is implemented for large range changefeeds, but we can figure that out once they're actually in.\n\nWe're close enough to the release that I'm a little hesitant to change this for 2.0, but I'm not entirely opposed.  @danielmewes, @VeXocide, what do you think?\n"
