        "I installed rethinkdb with a simple `sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:rethinkdb/ppa; sudo apt-get install -y rethinkdb`, and run it with `sudo service rethinkdb start`. But when the server crashes (has gone our of memory a few times using v1.11, about to upgrade to 1.12), it just stays off. It would be awesome to have it auto-restart, for minimal downtime.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do this natively? or some other solution that works well with rethink?"
