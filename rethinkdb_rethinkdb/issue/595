        "There are at least 2 pieces of static value sugar I think are needed for secondary indexes:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n# indexing a field, the following are equivalent\r\ntable.index(\"foo\")\r\ntable.index(\"foo\", \"foo\")\r\ntable.index(\"foo\", lambda x: x[\"foo\"])\r\n\r\n# compound indexes, the following are equivalent\r\ntable.index([\"foo\", \"bar\"]) # This one seems questionable\r\ntable.index(\"foo_bar\", [\"foo\", \"bar\"])\r\ntable.index(\"foo_bar\", lambda x: [x[\"foo\"], x[\"bar\"]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first compound index notation seems questionable to me because it's not an immediately obvious name, on the other hand it's convenient and I can't see any way it's dangerous so it's probably okay.\r\n\r\nPresumably these should be done server side rather than in the drivers.\r\n\r\nAlso we need API tests for this."
