        "There are at least 2 pieces of static value sugar I think are needed for secondary indexes:\n\n``` Python\n# indexing a field, the following are equivalent\ntable.index(\"foo\")\ntable.index(\"foo\", \"foo\")\ntable.index(\"foo\", lambda x: x[\"foo\"])\n\n# compound indexes, the following are equivalent\ntable.index([\"foo\", \"bar\"]) # This one seems questionable\ntable.index(\"foo_bar\", [\"foo\", \"bar\"])\ntable.index(\"foo_bar\", lambda x: [x[\"foo\"], x[\"bar\"]])\n```\n\nThe first compound index notation seems questionable to me because it's not an immediately obvious name, on the other hand it's convenient and I can't see any way it's dangerous so it's probably okay.\n\nPresumably these should be done server side rather than in the drivers.\n\nAlso we need API tests for this.\n"
