      "In a clustered environment, I suggest that we use named table spaces. This is the proposal:\r\n\r\nWhen creating a table, you can pass an opt arg `table_space=<name string>`.\r\n\r\nEach individual server would have a default table space (what's currently the `rethinkdb_data` directory). When it is asked to become a replica for a table that has a `table_space` specified, and the server doesn't know that particular table space,, it will place the table file in the default table space. Furthermore all tables without a table space specification will end up there.\r\nIn addition one can define additional table space name -> directory mappings when starting the server, e.g.\r\n`rethinkdb -d /var/lib/default_tablespace --table-space tb1:/mnt/tablespace1 --table-space tb2:/mnt/tablespace2`\r\n\r\nSo now a table that is created with `table_space=\"tb1\"` would have its files stored in /mnt/tablespace1 on this particular server."
