      "The issue i see here is if you have a table space for SSD and a table space for HDD the problem is that your hdd table may be to large to fit on an ssd table space on another server and so on. So i should be able to have table sapces that are tagged so that way it will put tables to nodes with matching table space tags.so if the table is default its fine any table space is fine i the table space is big data and your table space ssd is not tagged with bigdata then it wont get the big data but you may have another tablespace on anotehr server called ssd which is on ssd but is tagged with big data and it can then have tables tagged with big data table space."
