      "@wojons Only the nodes that have a table space with the name specified for the table will use that table space. Servers that don't have a table space by that name would put the table file in the default table space.\r\n\r\nIf you change the set of table spaces that a server has while it is member of a cluster we could emit an error. Or we might allow adding new table spaces to a server later, but leave existing table files in their current table space."
