      "Thanks for the quick response, @danielmewes.\r\n\r\nAh, ok, so the wording in the \"Inaccessible database file\" error is just a little misleading in that it makes it sound like rethinkdb is willing to create the metadata file for an existing data directory, when that actually only applies to new data directories. \r\n\r\nOkay, I guess we didn't realize that the metadata file is so crucial (probably because of the wording mentioned above). We're still trying to figure out why that particular file went missing. I don't suppose that there is any known reason that this particular file would get destroyed (e.g. unclean shutdown of the machine), is there?\r\n\r\nThe actual behavior (infinite loop when metadata is empty) isn't as troubling as the lack of relevant logging. Since there were no error messages, we ended up staring at the thing for a bit waiting for it to \"finish whatever it's doing\", thinking it was just trying to rebuild an index or something. "
