      "Since the JavaScript driver is built as part of the main executable, I would nominate that this be converted to C/C++. JavaScript is not a great option, as it would add an JavaScript interpreter to the dependencies list (e.g.: Node, WebKit, etc). Neither C nor C++ are as nice as Ruby or Python, but unless we already have a Python dependency somewhere it is they are the only reasonable options that don't add dependancies."
