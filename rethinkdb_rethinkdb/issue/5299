This can be annoying if you're filtering based on a join since, as far as I know, the only workaround is to check the key length yourself first. This isn't exactly straight forward to do, especially if you're using a compound primary key.\n\n``` js\ntable.filter(\n  r.or(\n    r.add(r.row('lab_code'), r.row('test_code')).split('').count().ge(124),\n    other_table.get([ r.row('lab_code'), r.row('test_code') ]).eq(null)\n  )\n)\n\n// vs\n\ntable.filter(\n  other_table.get([ r.row('lab_code'), r.row('test_code') ]).eq(null).default(true)\n)\n```\n"
