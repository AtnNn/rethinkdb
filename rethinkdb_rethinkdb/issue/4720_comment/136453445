      "In discussing this offline with @danielmewes we came to the conclusion that `emergency_repair=\"force\"` may do more harm than good if it could overwrite the existing configuration with a completely new one. Instead we're going to add an `emergency_repair` mode that recommits the existing configuration with a new epoch.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is to repair problems that shouldn't normally occur we've decided to name it `emergency_repair=\"_debug_recommit\"`."
