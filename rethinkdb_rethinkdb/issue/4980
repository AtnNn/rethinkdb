        "I've been using rethinkdb in production over the last 15 days on a fairly high scale environment. I've had it fail twice. \r\nI have a 3 machine cluster setup.\r\nThe first time it threw errors was when it was trying to elect a new raft leader. The other 2 servers were disconnected from the machine I was using my application server to connect to. This lasted in all for about 8 mins and it stabilised by itself.\r\n\r\nThe second instance was fatal. The first machine in the cluster died, i.e. rethinkdb was terminated. It had to be brought back up manually.\r\n\r\nThese were the last few logs before it died.\r\n```\r\n2015-10-22T08:25:53.554220227 1870727.610543s notice: Disconnected from server \"rethinkdb3\"  <hash>\r\n2015-10-22T08:26:04.410635825 1870738.466958s info: Table <hash>: Starting a new Raft election for term 187.\r\n2015-10-22T08:26:14.290542789 1870748.346865s info: Table <hash>: Raft election timed out. Starting a new election for term 188.\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuestions.\r\n1) Where can I find out additional logging as to why rethink might have shut down? Previously when rethink had shutdown, there were genuine errors I could refer to, to see the problem\r\n2) Does using rethindb-proxy in such a situation help? Would it better for me to connect my app server to the proxy instead?"
