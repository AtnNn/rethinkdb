        "The problem with the `--client-port` option used in the tests is avoiding having two instances with the same port, or accidentally using a port that is already in use.\n\nInstead, `rethinkd serve` could automatically bind a socket to zero and use that port as the client port for all cluster connections.\n\nThis feature could take the form of a `--fixed-client-port` option to `rethinkdb serve`.\n\nIt would make the tests that simulate netsplits more reliable.\n"
