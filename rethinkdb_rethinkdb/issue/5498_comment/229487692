      "@mbrevoort This issue is about the behavior of RethinkDB when you don't set a cache size, and it's more of a missing feature than a bug. Could you open a separate issue about your problem? It's certainly bad behavior and I'd like to see it tracked down, but I don't think it's related to this."
