      "@gchpaco That test looks like it's only retrieving a single document from the table, which doesn't use batching.\r\n\r\nFor batching to take effect you should probably try something like `r.table('test')` on a table that has at least 100 documents or so, and also make sure you load the full result set and not only the initial batch from the resulting cursor."
