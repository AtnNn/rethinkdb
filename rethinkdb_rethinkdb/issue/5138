        "Since `proxy` is a subcommand rather than a flag, you currently can't specify it in the config file for the startup script.  We should probably either make it a flag instead of a subcommand or update our startup script to let the config file specify subcommands.\r\n\r\nThis seems important since people are starting to actually use changefeeds and automatically starting a proxy node on their app server is a reasonable thing to want to do."
