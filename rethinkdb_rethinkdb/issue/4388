        "For emergency situations we should add a special read mode which allows extracting a table's data directly from a given server, ignoring shard and replica constraints. This will often allow recovering data under unrecoverable failures of the clustering / metadata logic.\n\nIt could even be a command line argument that dumps the content of a given table file into a local JSON file. Something like\n`rethinkdb emergency-extract --table <table UUID> --out table.json`\n"
