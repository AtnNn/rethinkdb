      "We discussed a while ago whether we should throw our own error type, or use the standard error types for connection errors. As far as I remember, we decided to use the default types in Ruby for these errors because a lot of people are already familiar with them and know how to handle them and what they mean. Some libraries (e.g. for a connection pool) might also be able to deal with the standard errors out of the box, while using ReQL specific error types would require modifying them.\r\n\r\n@mlucy Do you remember more details about this?\r\n\r\nI'm open to reconsidering this, if there's a good reason for throwing a ReQL error instead."
