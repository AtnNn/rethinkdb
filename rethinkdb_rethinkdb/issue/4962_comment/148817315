      "I think it's usually considered bad practice to wrap native errors in your own error type.  `ECONNREFUSED` is a little bit of an edge case because it's produced by calling `.connect`, so people could reasonably expect a RethinkDB connection error there (and in fact if the connection succeeds but the handshake fails we do produce our own error).\r\n\r\nLast time we talked about this we ended up deciding that it was better not to wrap native errors, but I'd be open to rediscussing it."
