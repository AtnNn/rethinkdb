      "I am in favor of wrapping generally. In this case my reasoning is that we are the ones managing the underlying tcp/ip connection, and so people are not directly exposed to the API that is generating this error. To me the ideal solution would be to inherit both from `r.ReqlError` and from the native error. That way you could catch things either way, depending on how you wanted to look at it."
