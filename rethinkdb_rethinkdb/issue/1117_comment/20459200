      "I just took a look at my cache, and I have multiple cached version of the files (`cluster-min.js?v=1.6.0` and `cluster-min.js?v=1.7.1` for example).\r\n\r\nWe changed the doc format in 1.7 to remove the fake-ish hierarchy to provide better suggestions. The docs are loaded through a json request (to `js/reql_docs.json`). This ajax request doesn't have something like `?v=x.x.x` so the browser is going to use the cached version from 1.6.\r\n\r\nSince the file is loaded through an ajax request, refreshing doesn't help (or less than if it was in a script tag).\r\n\r\nIt should be pretty easy to fix. \r\n@atnnn another point release is coming : )\r\n\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAbout the fact that opening the web console solves the issue sounds really strange, and for now I have no idea how it could influence anything here.\r\n"
