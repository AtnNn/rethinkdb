      "Pests from IRC here.\r\n\r\nNoticed the upgrade notice as well, running \"rethinkdb 1.7.1-0ubuntu1~raring (GCC 4.7.3)\". Popped into IRC and @mglukhovsky asked if the Data Explorer still worked. \r\n\r\nNoticed right away the auto complete was not working and he then suggested looking for errors in the dev console (standard Chrome install). Once that was opened everything worked fine with and without the console open.\r\n\r\nBetween each of these steps and on each page I performed multiple hard refreshes and the notice did not go away and the DE auto complete did not begin to work until the console was opened.\r\n"
