      "Another user on IRC (Pests) had this exact issue as well. He suspected it was a cache issue too.\r\n\r\nThe autocomplete for the Data Explorer was broken for him (not appearing) with no errors in the console.  Despite multiple hard refreshes, the autocomplete popover didn't appear-- however opening the dev tools in Chrome instantly made the popover appear.\r\n\r\nThis is troubling because it means our caching technique is causing problems bween versions of RethinkDB. Are we not expiring our cache correctly? We should reopen #172 if this is the case."
