      "I think that the `PROTOC protoc-gen-ccjs` rule is being run before the `MAKE protoc` rule.\r\n\r\nDid it already build `support/usr/bin/protoc`?\r\n\r\nIf not, you can fetch and build it with this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake support/usr/bin/protoc\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then resuming the build should use the fetched version of protoc for the closure.\r\n\r\nIf I'm right, then the fix should be easy."
