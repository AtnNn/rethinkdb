        "Proxies never show up in the jobs table, since they don't have a server name (or maybe for other reasons as well).\r\n\r\nThis is an issue for queries that are run through a proxy. Those will be invisible in the `jobs` table.\r\nIn clusters that use proxies, this will usually be pretty much all queries.\r\n\r\nThe second point in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3647 would fix this for the most part, but is non-trivial.\r\n\r\nWe should think about whether there's a reasonable and simple fix for this.\r\n\r\nPinging @VeXocide "
