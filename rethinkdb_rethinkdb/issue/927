        "Having other people work on the RQL code has exposed a few implicit constraints that I never bothered to write down.  We should add comments and/or asserts for these, or change the interface to make them hard to mess up:\n- Compile time happens when a `term_t` is constructed, and runtime happens when `eval` is called on it.  So evaluating arguments in the constructor goes poorly.\n- If a term can push work to the shards it has to be in the first group of `term_forbids_writes`.\n- Calling `arg(0)` more than once can re-evaluate the argument.  (This is arguably just bad interface design.)\n\nI'll add more as I run into them.\n"
