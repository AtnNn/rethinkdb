      "@segphault -- `insert` doesn't currently throw an error, does it?  It just sets the `errors` field.  That said, I wouldn't be opposed to adding `conflict: 'ignore'` to make it set the `skipped` field instead.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes -- how would you feel about bumping this to polish?  It's mostly cosmetic and it can be replicated pretty easily with https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3753 ."
