      "I'm unable to reproduce this on newton.  Are you running with profiling on or off?\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, I think this could only happen if you got a query using the JSON protocol which had `accepts_r_json` set to `false`.  None of our drivers generate that.\r\n\r\n@neumino -- I created a branch `mlucy_2718` on GitHub which makes the JSON protocol always set `accepts_r_json` to `true` (which should probably be the case anyway, since with the JSON protocol that option doesn't affect what the user sees and only has one legal value).  Can you reproduce this based off that branch?\r\n\r\nIf so, this might be the same bug as https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2589 ."
