        "The structure of a row in my table is similar to this:\n\n``` js\n{\n  id: \"...\",\n  access: [\n    { user: \"danielmewes\", readOnly: false, grantedOn: Date },\n    { user: \"mlucy\", readOnly: true, grantedOn: Date }\n  ],\n  data: \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nWhat I'm after is: listing all the rows to which a given user has access to, ordered by `grantedOn` date in a performant way.\nWhile I can create an expression-based multi-index to get all the documents which I can then query, say, whether `\"danielmewes\"` is listed as having access in the access object array:\n\n``` js\nr.table('documents')\n  .createIndex('user-with-access', doc => doc('access').map(acc => acc('user')))\n```\n\nIt seems impossible to then order those documents in a performant way (with another index), because indexed `orderBy` must be done on a `Table` or a `TableSlice`.\n\nFinding out which documents a person has access to is the easy (and fast) part:\n\n``` js\nr.table('documents')\n  .getAll(['danielmewes'], { index: 'user-with-access' })\n```\n\nWith just 15000 documents in the database, passing a function that finds and returns the relevant record to an `orderBy` right after the above `getAll` takes a whole 8 seconds! (because it gets evaluated on every single record, because its not possible to use one index for ordering, while filtering out the irrelevant records with another)\n\nAm I simply blindly missing a simple solution here, or is this really a current limitation of RethinkDB?\n"
