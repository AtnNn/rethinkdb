      "So what is this issue actually saying should happen?  Is it saying that argument evaluation should happen before eval_impl is called?  Is it saying that argument evaluation results should be cached in args_t?  For some reason it's talking about bytecode interpreters, instead of saying what the problem is and what should be done, which only obfuscates the discussion and makes it seem fancy and complicated."
