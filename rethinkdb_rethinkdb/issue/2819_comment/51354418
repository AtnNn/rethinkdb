      "Argument evaluation order has nothing to do with the awkwardness of the bracket term's implementation.  (Whatever intrinsic awkwardness there is there has everything to do with the specification of bracket.)\r\n\r\nWe do use lazy argument evaluation, too.  It's used in the branch term.  I don't know how much use it is, given that datum_stream_t's are intrinsically lazy.  We would need the branch term to swallow errors."
