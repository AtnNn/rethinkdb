      "We could rename the `info` field. Maybe to `description`? In that case `progress` would have to become a top level field, even though we don't always have a value for it. Just a thought...\r\n\r\n@VeXocide Sorry for noticing this only now: The `disk_compaction` job should not have the `db` and `table` fields I think. We could consider what @timmaxw had suggested earlier, and give it a `tables` array with all tables that compaction is active on on that server. However it might become unnecessarily complex, because we would also have to represent the databases for each table. So I think we should leave it out for the first revision (/ code review).\r\n\r\n@VeXocide How are the compaction entries actually implemented at the moment? Does it generate one entry per server/table pair? Or one entry per table? Or one per server? It should be one per server."
