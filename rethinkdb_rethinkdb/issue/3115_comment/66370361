      "@coffeemug suggested that we could put a `sync_progress` (or similarly named) field into `table_status` to convey that information.\r\n\r\nWe had also thought about having *only* a single backfill entry per table in `jobs`, but @coffeemug prefers the more granular representation I believe.\r\n\r\nI would rather not have both a \"master\" backfill job and the individual per servers/table ones in the `jobs` table, because then the same underlying task would be represented twice."
