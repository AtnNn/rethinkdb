      "`background_disk_compaction` is a bit too exhaustive for my tastes, but I wouldn't be too opposed to it. Personally, I don't think the word \"background\" is necessary. RethinkDB isn't CouchDB, and things like compaction aren't sufficiently mainstream to warrant picking a different name to avoid confusing people. I'd call it `disk_compaction` and just explain what it is in the docs."
