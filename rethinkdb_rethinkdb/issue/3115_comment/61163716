      "@deontologician I think the basic structure looks good. Just a few comments:\r\n\r\n* I think we should not differentiate between individual shards in the jobs table if possible.\r\nInstead if any of the shards of a table is backfilling on a given server, we would have only a single entry for that table/server. The progress would take all shards of the table into account (though that's also a bit awkward. If only a single shard gets changed, the progress wouldn't start at 0 but somewhere in the middle because most shards would not be backfilling in the first place. Might be ok).\r\n* In addition to `table_name`/`table_id` we should also have `db_name`/`db_id` for completeness. Instead of `backfill_progress`, I would prefer calling the field `progress_percent`. We would standardize this so that in all cases where we can show progress (sindex constroction and backfilling) it would be a number between 0 and 100.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I hadn't thought about before: We should have entries for both incoming and outgoing backfills. Two options here:\r\n* Have a common type `\"backfill\"` for both. In the `details` field, have a field `direction` that can have the two values `\"incoming\"` and `\"outgoing\"`.\r\n* Have two types `\"backfill_incoming\"` and `\"backfill_outgoing\"` on the top level, though possibly with names other than these."
