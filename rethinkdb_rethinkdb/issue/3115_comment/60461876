      "@VeXocide and I just talked about what the actual interface for the table should look like.\r\nHere's a proposal:\r\n\r\n* Each document in the table is of the form\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n{\r\n  id: <job uuid>,\r\n  servers: [<list of servers that are involved in this job>],\r\n  type: <\"backfill\"|\"index_construction\"|\"query\"|\"garbage_collection\">,\r\n  details: {...depending on 'type', this will have information such as the table/shard the backfill is on, the name of the index for an index_construction, progress information, etc....},\r\n  duration: <time the job has been running (max over all machines) in seconds>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* The documents in the table cannot be updated, and no new documents can be inserted\r\n* To cancel a job, you just delete the corresponding document: `r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').get(<job_id>).delete()`\r\n\r\n(*Edit:* renamed machines to servers)"
