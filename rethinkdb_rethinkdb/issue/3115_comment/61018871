      "I would call it \"on-disk compaction\", and I feel really strongly that we need to include it. It is *not* an implementation detail (or rather, it's a leaky one). People look at iostat and see Rethink writing to or reading from disk when there are no queries, and think \"wtf?!\" We need to include disk compaction into the job list to assuage those concerns."
