      "The performance costs to putting queries in the jobs table are negligible. When a query runs, it will register itself locally, but take no further action; only if the user reads from `rethinkdb.jobs` will the queries be formatted into rows. We could omit short-lived queries to reduce clutter, but performance is not a reason to do so."
