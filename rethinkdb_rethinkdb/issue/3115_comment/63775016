      "@coffeemug I think it's very important that the `servers` field is consistent, even if it only ever has one entry for certain types of jobs. This is what makes it possible to easily get an overview of all jobs running on a given server.\r\n\r\nMy impression was that we agreed on having one compaction job per server https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3115#issuecomment-61021173 . Though that might have been a misunderstanding. Maybe you actually wanted one per table/server pair?\r\n\r\nI think one compaction entry per server is sufficient, and we should not split it up for individual tables. That keeps the jobs table cleaner.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the `info` subdocument was that it would contain the sort of information that is specific to the type of job, while all the top level fields would always exist (and can therefore more easily be used for filtering and grouping of jobs). I think that is better than flattening it out. I could be convinced otherwise of course."
