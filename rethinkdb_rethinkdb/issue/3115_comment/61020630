      "\"Disk compaction\" isn't a bad name. A very minor problem with it is that it can be confused with CouchDB's compaction http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Compaction, which is a pretty heavy weight process from what I understand. \r\nWe could call it \"incremental disk compaction\" or \"background disk compaction\"?\r\n\r\nI think the suggested \"load\" (or \"priority\"?) field in the details would be good. It could have a number roughly proportional to the number of data GC threads running (e.g. running number of threads divided by maximum number of threads that could be running on the given machine or table).\r\n\r\nEither one entry per machine or one per table/machine pair (i.e. serializer) would be fine IMO."
