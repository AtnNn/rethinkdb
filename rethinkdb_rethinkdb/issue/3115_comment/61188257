      "> What would be the content of the `identifier_format` field?\r\n\r\nIt's not a field, it's an optarg to `run` (we discussed it before). I'd call the fields `table` and `database`, and if `identifier_format` optarg is set to `'name'` (default), we'd show names; if it's `'uuid'` we show uuids.\r\n\r\n> I think the question of how to expose backfill jobs needs a bit more thought.\r\n\r\nHow about one document per `[backfill_sender, backfill_receiver, table]`? This way I can tell (via `group`):\r\n\r\n- Everything being sent from a given machine\r\n- Everything being received by a given machine\r\n- All backfills for a given table\r\n\r\nI like that a lot.\r\n\r\n(Also, a friendly reminder -- we should always call fields `server` instead of `machine`)"
