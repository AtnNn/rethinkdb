      "Talked to @VeXocide. For `disk_compaction`, we decided to have one entry per server, without any info about the tables it's running on. (basically what had been proposed before)\r\n\r\nThe choice we make here is going to impact our options to add control over disk compaction in the future, such as an option to pause it temporarily. With the decided upon interface, you could pause it on a per-server basis, but not (easily) on a per-table basis. This makes sense, because disk compaction's impact is primarily on disk i/o and disk space, both of which are per-server properties right now. This might change some day when we add support for table spaces https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1770 . We can consider changing the disk_compaction representation in the jobs table when we get there."
