      "1. I think this MUST be in the job control and As a user i may want GC to be turned off depending on the work load if that table maybe i know that everyday between 12am-12pm i write lots and lots and lots of records, but after that i dont do anything so i dont mind gc running\r\n\r\n2. i think compaction is the wrong work. From what i understand the gc in rethinkdb is not reclaiming disk space for the OS. Its reclaiming disk space/blocks for its self to use.I think the correct word to use in this place is \"disk cleanup\" but again could be miss leading. "
