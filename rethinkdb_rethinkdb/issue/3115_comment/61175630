      "> ```javascript\r\n{\r\n    backfill_progress: <percentage>,\r\n    table_id: <uuid>,\r\n    table_name: <string>,\r\n    server_id: <uuid>,\r\n    server_name: <string>,\r\n    shard_position: <number>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA few notes on this:\r\n\r\n- I agree with @danielmewes that we should aggregate shard info on table/server basis. If we're backfilling from two shards on T1 from S1 to S2, we should show it as one job.\r\n- I think backfill progress should be a ratio between zero and one. I don't think it should be a percentage.\r\n- I cannot tell from this document/field names where we're replicating from and to. I think we should make it clear in the job -- we're replicating T1 from S1 to S2. We could also split it into two jobs like @danielmewes suggested, but I think that's less useful/more confusing. I think the replication job shouldn't be per server per table, but per server pair per table.\r\n- I think we shouldn't include server/table/database IDs, and instead use `identifier_format` field for consistency. It would make the document less confusing (fewer fields), and be consistent with other stuff we do.\r\n"
