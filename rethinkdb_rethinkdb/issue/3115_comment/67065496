      "@deontologician: Two things:\r\na) I realized that if you want to do a delete, you'll always first do a selection (e.g. `r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').get(...).delete()`). So the selection takes care of making sure the document exists.\r\nb) The way ReQL is implemented the write operation is guaranteed to see the primary key for each document that it should modify. In most cases you will also have the full document available, so you could check the job `type` from there. However I don't think there's a real guarantee for this (and even when it's there, getting access to the document would probably require a little refactoring)."
