      "Oh I misunderstood what you meant by the `identifier_format`. No objections then.\r\n(also sorry for again using `machine`. I thought I had changed it but apparently not).\r\n\r\nAbout the one document per `[backfill_sender, backfill_receiver, table]`: First to clarify: Do you think there should be at most one `backfill_sender` and `backfill_receiver` entry per server? Or would those be per server/table pair?\r\n\r\nAn aspect that I don't like that much about this is that it would double-account for the same underlying work. Once in the sender/receiver entries, and a second time in the per-table entry.\r\n\r\nIf instead we only did one entry per sender/table and receiver/table pair without the overall per-table entry, those entries would describe disjoint jobs.\r\nTo then generate the progress bar in the web UI we would have to get all `backfill_receiver` entries that run on the given table, and sum their progresses divided by the number of shards*replicas on the table.\r\n\r\nI actually don't know which one I like better. Both don't seem that great to me."
