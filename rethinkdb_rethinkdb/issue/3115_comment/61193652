      "> You insert one job per unique sender/receiver/table triple.\r\n\r\nThat looks good. I like that.\r\n\r\nI assume your listing only shows the `details` field of the top level job document?\r\nOr do you think we should actually use different top level formats for different job types? In the latter case we should at least still always have the `duration`, `type` and `servers` fields I think, to allow for filtering / aggregation over all jobs."
