      "I'd spoken briefly with @danielmewes about having some \"master\" backfill job that tracks the overall progress, since it's impossible to track the overall progress from just the per-table jobs available at any given instant. If we get that it could replace the current \"shards_available/total_shards == backfill progress\" hack that's in the webui now."
