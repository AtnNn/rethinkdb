      "The only way to support change-feeds on the job table and still get this product out the door in a reasonable time-frame is to use polling. In other words, if the user asks for `r.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"jobs\").changes()`, it will fetch the job list once per second and send the user the diff. So they'll see a random cross-section of short-lived queries."
