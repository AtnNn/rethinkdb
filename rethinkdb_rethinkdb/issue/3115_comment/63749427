Since this is growing out of hand the following remaining pieces can be tackled as separate tasks.\r\n\r\n- [x] List `\"backfill\"` jobs.\r\n- [x] List `progress` in `\"index_construction\"` jobs.\r\n- [x] Allow `\"query\"` jobs to be interrupted.\r\n- [x] List `info` for `\"query\"` jobs.\r\n- [x] Integration tests.\r\n- [ ] Extend the `info` for `\"query\"` jobs by pretty-printing the query itself.\r\n- [ ] Distribute the `\"query\"` job identifier when distributing the query.\r\n- [ ] Improve display of changefeed jobs."
