      "- Disk compaction jobs don't really make sense across servers, so having an array of servers doesn't make sense. We'd really need to add a document (job) per server for compaction (really, per table per server). I can see the rationale of keeping the field consistent with other jobs and always having a single server in the array, but I think that's subpar -- the document's structure should reflect the actual job. I'd consider renaming the field to `server` for compaction. (Or may be not... just a thought)\r\n- I think the `info` field is kind of pointless. I'd get rid of it and flatten the document."
