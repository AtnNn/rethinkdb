      "I'm not quite convinced of that. Garbage collection can have an impact on performance, and more importantly it generates disk i/o.\r\nIf I see that RethinkDB is doing disk reads and/or writes, I expect that I can look at the jobs table and see that there is something going on. If it was empty despite the i/o, that would be weird."
