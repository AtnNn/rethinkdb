      "> @coffeemug prefers the more granular representation I believe.\r\n\r\nI do think it's important to report which table the data is being replicated for, where from, and where to. We could get away with giving the user less information, but from many conversations with devops people I know they'd love this kind of visibility (even if they don't end up using it, just having the option goes a very long way to put people at ease)."
