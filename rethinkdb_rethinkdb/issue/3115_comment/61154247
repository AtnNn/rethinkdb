      "@danielmewes @coffeemug @VeXocide does anyone have a spec for what the details will look like for backfill?\r\n\r\nIf not, basic suggestion:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n    backfill_progress: <percentage>,\r\n    table_id: <uuid>,\r\n    table_name: <string>,\r\n    server_id: <uuid>,\r\n    server_name: <string>,\r\n    shard_position: <number>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`shard_position` is kind of weird since it draws attention to the fact that thus far shards don't have ids, just a position in an array."
