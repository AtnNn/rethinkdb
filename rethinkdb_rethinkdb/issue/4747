        "I've been writing a lot of integration tests using randomly generated uuids for database/table names, and repeatedly slamming a local database with tableCreates/tableDrops, etc. I've found two weird things crop up as a result:\n- the front page of my admin panel now just says:\n  \n  ```\n  Error\n  \n  The request to retrieve data failed. You can try to refresh\n  \n  Error:\n  ```\n- even though my \"Tables\" tab in the admin panel indicates I have two tables in the cluster, the \"tables\" badge on the top right indicates: \"Tables - 52/52 ready\"\n\nPossibly related. This is with RethinkDB 2.1.1 on OSX 10.10.4\n"
