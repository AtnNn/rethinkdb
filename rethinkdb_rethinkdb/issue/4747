You can try to refresh\r\n\r\n    Error:\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n   * even though my \"Tables\" tab in the admin panel indicates I have two tables in the cluster, the \"tables\" badge on the top right indicates: \"Tables - 52/52 ready\"\r\n\r\nPossibly related. This is with RethinkDB 2.1.1 on OSX 10.10.4"
