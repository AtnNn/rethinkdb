        "The example for zip in the JS API doc reads:\n\n```\nr.table('t1').eqJoin('t2', 'id').zip().run(conn, callback)\n```\n\nThe arguments to eqJoin here seem to be invalid. First, the order should be ('id', 't2'). Second, 't2' should really be r.table('t2'). So overall, the following would actually work:\n\n```\nr.table('t1').eqJoin('id', r.table('t2')).zip().run(conn, callback)\n```\n\nThe examples for the other languages look similarly wrong.\n"
