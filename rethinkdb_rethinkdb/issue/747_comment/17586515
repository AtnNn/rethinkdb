      "It appears the problem was that rdb_modification_report_cb_t::on_mod_report was being called concurrently, which it was not written to handle.  I have a fix for this, but I'm told that the fix for #727 affects this.  Will try to reproduce tomorrow based on those changes and see what comes up."
