      "In the windows branch:\r\n\r\n* Network IO is done using overlapped IO and IOCP\r\n* Disk IO uses the thread pool\r\n\r\nThe IOCP implementation is not efficient because HANDLEs cannot be moved from one IOCP to another, and the current design has one IOCP per thread. An alternative would be to never rethread handles or possibly to use APC instead of IOCP.\r\n\r\nIt might be better to use overlapped IO for disk IO."
