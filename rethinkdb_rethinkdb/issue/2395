While it is easy to just do something simple on the connection (e.g.: list databases) and trap for the error on a stale connection, it is more elegant to have a 'ping' command that encapsulates this for you. For example the ping command in MySQL:\r\n\r\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-api-mysqlconnection-ping.html"
