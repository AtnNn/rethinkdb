        "On both my home and office computers I am unable to build `next` as the build hangs on the \"FETCH browserify_3.24.13\" step (I can only tell this by canceling the build). A bit of investigation and I found the issues is with the  the `npm pack` line in `mk/support/pkg/npm-pkg.inc`. That process continues running indefinitely and the output file continues to grow (I saw 6.5 gigs).\n\nMy theory is that because we are calling `npm pack` in a directory that contains the cache folder that we are using that it somehow creates a loop continuously adding more files. I have no explanation about why this is happening on my two computers and not on gantz or newton. Initially I suspected `npm` versions, but have since rules that out. it might also be version of MacOS.\n\nHowever, I have been able to work around it by changing the `pkg_fetch` method of `mk/support/pkg/npm-pkg.inc` to the following change that moves the cache to `/tmp` (or more pointedlyL out of the same directory):\n\n``` bash\npkg_fetch () {\n    pkg_make_tmp_fetch_dir\n    cp \"$pkg_dir/$npm_package.shrinkwrap\" \"$tmp_dir/npm-shrinkwrap.json\"\n    cache_dir=$(mktemp -d \"/tmp/npm_cache-XXXXXXXX\")\n    package_json > \"$tmp_dir/package.json\"\n    mkdir \"$tmp_dir/node_modules\"\n    in_dir \"$tmp_dir\" npm --cache \"$cache_dir\" install\n    in_dir \"$tmp_dir\" npm --cache \"$cache_dir\" pack\n    in_dir \"$tmp_dir\" tar xf packed-$npm_package-$version.tgz\n    mv \"$tmp_dir/package\" \"$src_dir\"\n    pkg_remove_tmp_fetch_dir\n}\n```\n\nWe should make some change similar to this. Over to @AtnNn as this is his area.\n"
