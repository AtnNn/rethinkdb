        "The execution time of the `tableCreate` command hovers around 1s in SSDs, and creates a 3MB file. There are two pieces of weirdness here:\r\n\r\n- It shouldn't take anywhere near 1s to write 1MB on a modern SSD -- we're about an order of magnitude off. So there is something else going on performance-wise that we should fix.\r\n- We should cut down from 1MB to something smaller. There is no reason for an empty table to take up that much. (I know there is a big constant factor because of the serializer, but we should get that factor down).\r\n\r\nEdit: thought empty table size is 3MB, but it's actually 1MB."
