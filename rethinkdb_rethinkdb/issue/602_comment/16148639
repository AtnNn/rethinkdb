      "I just realized that, at least in both the Python and JS drivers, there is a way to explicitly specify that you want the default value for an optional argument. In Python you supply `()` and in JS you supply `undefined`. In these cases the driver will interpret these values as not setting the optional argument to anything. It's not really documented behavior but it does give you the same flexibility that @coffeemug wants."
