      "Wait, how exactly did we settle the index parameter issue? Are we going with an optional parameter by the name of \"index\" to all the relevant functions? This is how it will look in the other drivers:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntable.get_all(key, index=name)\r\ntable.between(lower, upper, index=name)\r\ntable.eq_join(field, other, index=name)\r\n```\r\n```javascript\r\ntable.getAll(key, {index:name})\r\ntable.between(lower, upper, {index:name})\r\ntable.eqJoin(field, other, {index:name})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, are we set with just not supporting secondary indices in `get`? I'm in favor but I didn't hear any positive acknowledgement from anyone."
