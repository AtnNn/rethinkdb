      "> Reads correctly left-to-right, and is hard to misunderstand.\r\n\r\nLooking at this more I agree with @al3xandru. I feel like if someone saw that by itself they'd assume it meant get all the rows whose field `:name` is equal to `'John'` and wouldn't know it has anything to do with indexes. \r\n\r\n```Ruby\r\ntbl.get_all('John', :index => :name)\r\n```\r\nSeems like it's unlikely to be miss understood. Although it does come at the cost of more verbosity."
