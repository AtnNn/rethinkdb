      "@mlucy I totally agree that this is in the right direction, but referring to an \"entity\" (name of index) that is defined in a completely different place is confusing.\r\n\r\n1.  Imagine you **didn't** write yourself the index creation code and now debugging the above line of code. What would be your first thought?\r\n\r\n2.  Imagine you are writing some new functionality for your application that requires multiple lookups. Now instead of \r\nthinking your queries in terms of conditions on your fields you also need to add to your (brain) buffer the names of the indexes you or someone else defined. \r\n\r\nEven if requires more typing this is what I'd find really legible:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ntbl.get_all(:name => 'John', :using_index => :idx_by_name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn top of being absolutely obvious we can also raise an error for cases where someone either forgot to define the index or the index cannot be used."
