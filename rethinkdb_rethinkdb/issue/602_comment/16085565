      "Having slept on it a bit more, I don't think we would need to add a new type. Since the secondary index object supports the same interface as a table it effectively *is a* table.\r\n\r\nThe only question is, do the slightly divergent performance semantics of secondary indices warrant being called out in the type system? If not, then the only change in the API (apart from what we've already all agreed on) is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nindex :: Table, !STRING -> Table\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe index method returns the table as viewed through the given secondary index with `table.index('secondary').index('primary')` being an identity operation."
