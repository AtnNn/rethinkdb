      "Let's restrict ourself to `get_all` for a moment.  We're trying to express \"get all the rows where the index `name` is `John`\".  The problem with:\r\n```ruby\r\ntbl.get_all('John', 'name')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs that the arguments are backward.  It's strange for the name of the index to come **after** the value of that index.  You don't say it that way in everyday speech, we don't use that convention anywhere else, and people might well think that it's the other way around.\r\n\r\nWe could swap the order, but people might still be confused by that.  By contrast:\r\n```ruby\r\ntbl.get_all(:name => 'John')\r\n```\r\n\r\nReads correctly left-to-right, and is hard to misunderstand."
