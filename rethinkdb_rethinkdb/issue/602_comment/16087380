      "I've been sleeping on this for a while too mainly because there was something intriguing about it, but also something that I didn't like but couldn't tell.\r\n\r\nFinally the previous comment nailed it! It is promoting the notion of indexes to the level of tables that I don't like (if an index is just a table can I insert data directly?). Secondly, once indexes become such a strong notion in our db (and it would be the only one that I know of that makes indexes so visible to end users), it will be more difficult to go to the next step of having a query analyzer (supporting hints when needed).\r\n\r\nI'm :thumbsup: with @jdoliner's initial proposal of providing indexes as an extra parameter to specific functions.\r\n"
