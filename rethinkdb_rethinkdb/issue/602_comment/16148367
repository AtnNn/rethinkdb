      "@coffeemug I think this was settled but we should be clear on this. The proposal is that the `index` argument is optional for all such API functions and defaults to the primary index. You can of course always explicitly supply the default value if you want.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner Can't we error if you try to create a secondary index with the same name as the primary index? Isn't this what we do if you try to create a secondary index with the same name as another secondary index?"
