      "```ruby\r\nr.table('people').get_all(:name, 'John') # although this one might be confusing\r\n```\r\n\r\nI find this one pretty confusing. The first time I read it, even if it was in this thread about secondary indexes, the way I read it was: \"retrieve the name field of all rows using 'John' as default value.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nr.table('people').index(:name).get_all('John')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI still don't think that we should promote the \"using index\" notion so high in the API. How do you feel about this (I know it's just a minor change, but who knows):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nr.table('people').get_all('John', :using_index => :name)\r\n```\r\n\r\n"
