      "I tend to agree with @coffeemug. The `.index()` while not too hard to understand is just strange compared to what we can find in other databases.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner can we enforce that we don't have redundant values for secondary indexes? I've seen some people storing multiple \"primary keys\".\r\nIf it's possible,  we can have `.get()` for these secondary indexes. \r\n\r\nFor `get`, `get_all`, `index_create`, `index_drop`, `index_list`, they sound quite good to me."
