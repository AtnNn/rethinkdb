      "@wmrowan -- sorry, the examples you gave above are the ones I'm going to encode into the tests.\r\n\r\nAs for `get`, I think it should just work for the primary index. No need to complicate our lives, and we can always change it later. I'd mildly prefer `get_all` to work with the primary index in addition to secondary ones, but if that's hard to do in the query language, I'm cool with not doing that."
