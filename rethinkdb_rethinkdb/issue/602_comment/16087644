      "I think that trying to explain the idea to people that `table.index('foo')` is actually a `table` is really going to be too confusing to be workable. While I do appreciate the elegance of this notion I think we're going to wind up asking people to reorganize their mental models too much without providing enough of a benefit to make them feel like it was worth their while once they do."
