      "Ah I see. I think that would be nice too but it's actually a bit tricky to do. It's a pain to get the functions for sindexes right now and routing all of that through the query language would be tough. I think this problem will have a much nicer solution once we have a way to actually save functions. Then we can just make sure to save all of the sindex functions using this method and make them accessible the same way as other functions which are saved."
