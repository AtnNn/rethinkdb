      "Thought of one more reason.\r\n\r\nWhile it complicates the interfaces of functions, it complicates them in a very consistent way. We don't arbitrarily increase complexity of interfaces by making them different for each function; it's the same technique applied to function after function. You do have to understand it once, but it's already ingrained in other functions like `update`. Once you do understand it, it's *really* nice to be able to pass it to other functions where it makes sense."
