      "We do this in many cases but none of those other cases can be accomplished so nicely with `do`. I think it's a really good idea to promote people learning to use the array functions with `do` as soon as possible because it's just such a powerful combination that lets you write very imperative looking code. I actually think we might want to make our doc examples for these functions use `do`.\r\n\r\nFor example consider the situation where you want to pop an element off the front of an array and push it on to the back, or delete the first element of an array if it's equal to a certain value. These are all very intuitive to write once you understand `do` and I think they're actually the type of operation that are going to be very common.\r\n\r\nI'm not really opposed to this feature in and of itself. It's just that it feels like it's baking the sentiment of \"`do` is a workaround\" in to our language which is a direction I really don't like.\" And even though these are small changes that are fairly unified I do feel like things like this actually have a big impact on the feel of a language. When a language consistently introduces me to concepts which I get to keep applying that's when a language really starts to feel powerful to me and I think promoting the `do` syntax as the way to do things like this is going to lead to that more than the alternative."
