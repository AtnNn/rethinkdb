      "Thinking about it, I think one thing I don't really like about `do` is that when I have a stream, I have to coerce it to an array. \r\nThe syntax here with `do` is slighly longer too.\r\n\r\nAbout this case with changeAt, the lambda function is the first thing I tried to replace an element. I was thinking of `changeAt` like `update` or `replace` where you can access the document you update."
