      "We can also see it like this: Once the majority of functions that take a datum can also take a lambda function, the complexity of the interface actually *decreases* with every additional function that accepts lambdas instead of datums as well.\r\n\r\nOnce every function accepts both, the complexity is arguably the same as if none accepts both.\r\n\r\nComplexity used here in its information-theoretical meaning... However I would argue that in this case that definition of complexity meets the subjective complexity of the interface pretty well."
