      "Hmm, `do` is a very powerful part of the language that I feel like we should really try to make accessible to people. I feel like there are going to be several cases like this one and building the logic in to each command is going to be a lot of work and a lot of work for people to learn. Could you think about how we could make `do` more accessible? I feel like having multiple use cases baked in to every function is going to rapidly lead to an inscrutable language over time even if each individual change seems like it's better than the alternative."
