      "In case of a large cluster (or a cluster with many tables), loading the dashboard can be expensive for a few reasons:\r\n- The more servers/tables you have, the bigger the content of `/ajax` is (status of the cluster, state the cluster should be)\r\n- The dashboard takes the load of computing the status of each table from the raw data sent by the server (whether the servers are up, if the tables are available for writes etc.).  This can get a little expensive as the number of table grow.\r\n- The graph on the dashboard show the stats for all the tables and aggregate everything in the browser, so the traffic for stats in the dashboard can get pretty big.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't think there is much I can do by tweaking only the JS code. Hopefully once https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2169 is done, computing the data for the dashboard will be cheaper and the server will take the burden of aggregating things which should reduce a lot the traffic.\r\n"
