If there are more queries, the additional ones will not be executed until one of the previous ones finishes.\n\nThis generally makes sense since it avoids overloading the server, but is problematic in the case of changefeeds.\n\nWe should probably remove that limit for changefeeds, or maybe even in general if that's easier.\n\n(assigning @mlucy)\n"
