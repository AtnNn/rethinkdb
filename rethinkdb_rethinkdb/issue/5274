        "During v2.2.3 testing I got a failure on `./test/run interface.server_config`, specifically on [line 123](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/v2.2.x/test/interface/server_config.py#L123). This is testing that we see a change in cache size (`cache_size_mb`) made through `rethinkdb.server_config` in `rethinkdb.server_status`. It looks like there might be a slight timing issue there, but @VeXocide's reading of the code means we should be looking at the same location.\r\n\r\nI am unable to reproduce this again on `newton` on solo runs, so it might require specific workloads to get to. Ultimately I expect this to come back to me to armor this test to make sure we get to that value within some reasonable amount of time."
