      "> I think clicking on the box should close it. Hitting a small `x' button with a mouse or touchpad can be very frustrating.\r\n\r\nI disagree. This prevents people from copy pasting, and is generally surprising behavior. There are two ways to close the box -- hitting ESC, or clicking outside of the box. This is consistent with most other UI elements, and I think we should keep it this way.\r\n\r\n> After clicking on a method in the auto-completion box, my cursor disappears. I cannot keep typing. \r\n\r\nJust verified -- I get that too. We should definitely fix it."
