      "I think clicking on the box should close it. Hitting a small `x' button with a mouse or touchpad can be very frustrating.\r\n\r\nHere's another quirk: after clicking on a method in the auto-completion box, my cursor disappears. I cannot keep typing. Pressing TAB switches the focus to the Run button.\r\n\r\nI did not know that hitting TAB opened the documentation. Are these key bindings documented?"
