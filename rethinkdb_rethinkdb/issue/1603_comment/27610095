      "I agree that the first behavior (click on doc box closes the box) is really annoying and should be fixed.\r\n\r\nPersonally I like the second behavior. I think leaving the docs if you click on a command link would result in a weird interaction. Personally I'd prefer to keep it as is (you can always hit TAB to see the documentation)."
