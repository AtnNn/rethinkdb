      "In my opinion, clicking outside the box is not a valid solution because it changes the cursor position. Escape would be a valid solution, but it isn't documented and is not compatible with my browser plugins. Click to close is very common for this kind of documentation, if I remember correctly it is what Visual Studio does. In my original post I suggested adding a link to the full docs, the documentation can be copy/pasted from that page."
