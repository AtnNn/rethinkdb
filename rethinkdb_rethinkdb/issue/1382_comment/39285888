      "A rough idea: It would be great to receive the output of these commands as a stream/sequence/whatever it's called. To see how many there are, just call `.count()`. Or you can do further operations on them, use a cursor to get results one-by-one, etc.\r\n\r\nTo allow backwards-compatibility, consider creating a new option, naming it something instead of return_vals, and allowing but deprecating `return_vals: true`."
