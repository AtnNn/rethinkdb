      "I think that this issue will be mostly solved when we allow `return_vals` on multi-row write operations.  The syntax proposed in the first comment would be convenient, but isn't strictly necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of shipping quickly, I'd like to merge this with https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1783 as a single \"make `return_vals` work with batch write operations\", and then if the return type is too unwieldy for people in practice we can come back to this later."
