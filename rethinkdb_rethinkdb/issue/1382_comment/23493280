      "Hi @coffeemug,\r\n\r\nInserting documents one at a time using `return_vals` is a valid solution to my problem. Unfortunately, the performance of single document insertion (even with soft durability) is much slower than bulk insertion. I'll have to live without this functionality for now.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."
