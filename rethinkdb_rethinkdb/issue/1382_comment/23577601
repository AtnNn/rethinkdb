      "@omus -- there are a some of things you can do to speed up single-document inserts. One option is increasing parallelism (open multiple connections and insert through multiple threads instead of one at a time). With enough threads, insertion should be nearly as fast as doing a bulk insert. Check out this document for more details: http://rethinkdb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#my-insert-queries-are-slow.-how-can-i-speed-t\r\n\r\nThanks for being patient about this. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and we'll try to get this fixed as soon as we can!"
