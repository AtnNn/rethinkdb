      "Hi @omus. I just replied to @underrun about a related issue (#1381).\r\n\r\nWe've been talking about improving information reporting for batch operations for quite some time. There are clearly cases (like yours here, but also others) when reporting just a summary is insufficient. Rethink supports `return_vals` argument (see http://rethinkdb.com/api/#js:writing_data-insert) that returns a new and old version of the document, but unfortunately right now it only works on a single insert, not on batched inserts. We're working really hard on performance and scalability now, so it might be a little time before we get to this. There is definitely something we'll do about it (though I'm not sure what yet -- one option is to extend `return_vals` to work on batches).\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, could you try inserting documents one at a time (possibly with soft durability on to speed things up) with `return_vals` turned on?\r\n\r\nMoving to subsequent for now."
