      "@mlucy -- ok, I like that a lot. So to sum up:\r\n\r\n- Rename `return_vals` to `return_changes`\r\n- When `return_changes` is `true`, add a field `changes` that contains an array of `{old_vail=>..., new_val=>...}` objects.\r\n- Make that work both for single row changes and multi-row changes.\r\n- Also use `{old_vail=>..., new_val=>...}` objects in the feeds API (for consistency).\r\n\r\nThat's really neat. Also -- I don't think we should worry about breaking compatibility quite yet. We're making the API much better and more consistent, I don't think we should accumulate baggage quite yet.\r\n\r\n@dmitrig01 -- you could always do something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nr.table('foo').update(..., return_changes=True)['changes'].count()\r\n```"
