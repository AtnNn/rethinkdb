If they are expected to fail, there should be a well-defined, helpful error message.\r\n\r\n* 1.x.0-* drivers <-> latest server\r\n* 1.(x-k).0-* drivers <-> latest server\r\n* latest drivers <-> 1.(x-k).* server\r\n* 1.x.* server <-> latest server\r\n* 1.(x-k).* server <-> latest server\r\n* 1.x.* data directory <-> latest server\r\n* 1.(x-k).* data directory <-> latest server\r\n* latest data directory <-> 1.(x-1).* server\r\n\r\nWhere\r\n* latest is the version being tested, either next or the point release branch.\r\n* 1.x.* are other point releases of the same major version\r\n* 1.(x-k).* are previous major releases, which may or may not be compatible.\r\n\r\nThis issue does not address testing compatibility of the same version running on different architectures."
