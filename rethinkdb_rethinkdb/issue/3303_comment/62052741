      "Hi @kmcgrady , thank you for opening the issue.\r\n\r\nActually looking at the screenshot, it seems that it has finished replicating 8 out of 9 shards, but is still busy with the last one. RethinkDB usually replicates a couple of shards simultaneously to improve throughput. When only one shard is left, this doesn't work anymore. That *might* explain the drop in performance that you are seeing.\r\n\r\nThe next time this happens, can you point your browser at `/ajax/progress` on the web UI port of one of the RethinkDB servers and post the result here? If we can compare that output at a time where the rebalancing is still fast and at the time where it has gotten slow, we could verify whether there are actually fewer parallel replications (\"backfills\") going on when it's slow or not."
