      "Thanks for the detailed issue report @quexer.\r\nMy initial guess is that we're exhausting CPU, since you're seeing a good improvement in throughput when increasing the number of cores. We've primarily focussed on the CPU efficiency of read operations, but this is a good opportunity to start optimizing that of writes as well. We're going to profile the server to see if we can find any obvious inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nHave you checked CPU utilization on the client machine as well?\r\n\r\nOne additional questions so we can better test this: What do the documents look like? If you have an example document that you can share that would be ideal. Otherwise: how large are the documents approximately, and how many fields do they have? Do they have any nested objects or arrays?"
