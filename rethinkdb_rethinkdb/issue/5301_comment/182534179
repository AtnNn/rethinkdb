      "I did some CPU profiling and implemented a minor optimization in 31dac8e6d7ef46935f2696d2522b803e184b1673 (review 3469).\r\nWhile this saves some CPU for insert workloads (up to 10%), it probably won't have a *huge* impact on overall insert performance.\r\n\r\nThis issue needs more research."
