        "I am seeing an error most of the time I run `./run interface.log` test. The specific failure as show in the test is not real useful:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/ssd2/larkost/rethinkdb/test/interface/log.py\", line 33, in <module>\r\n    log = access.get_log(access.machines.keys()[0], max_length = num_entries + 100)\r\n  File \"/home/ssd2/larkost/rethinkdb/test/common/http_admin.py\", line 356, in get_log\r\n    raise BadServerResponse(200, log)\r\n```\r\nA bit of digging as a group and it looks like the root of the problem is in the `file_reverse_reader_t` function in `src/clustering/administration/logger.cc`. Specifically it is returning a pair of log lines in a single `get_next` call, including the intervening newline.\r\n\r\nI am not always getting this issue, and can't reproduce it locally, but get it pretty consistently on the `larkost/2623-v1.13.1-test-fixes` branch when running on newton."
