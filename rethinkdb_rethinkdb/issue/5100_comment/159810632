      "How does this work when neither `Connection` or `ConnectionBase` have a `__await__` method inside of `net_asyncio`?\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the idea was to implement both asynchronous iteration (`__aiter__`) as well as asynchronous context managers (`__aenter__` and `__aexit__`) .\r\n\r\nHowever, since doing nothing to the existing class worked, I'm curious to see of seeing if setting `__await__ = __iter__` does the trick."
