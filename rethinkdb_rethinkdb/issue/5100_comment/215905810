      "AFAIRemember @gamesbrainiac my PR I linked below the `await` was working in the use case you described, but we held it back because the `async for ... in ...` and/or `async with ....` syntaxes were not complete and our Python tests were limited in testing the results properly. But you're welcome to try it out or give us a hand if this is your area of expertise! \r\n\r\nRelated to #5354 "
