      "Nudge.\r\n\r\nI believe it's been about 4 months since I asked in the RethinkDB Slack channel. I was told, \"that will be supported soon\", and was sent here.\r\n\r\nWhat's it going to take to get this feature added? Despite RethinkDB being a commercial company, I'm willing to donate $50 personally. @foxx mentioned a bug bounty. I'm sure there are others willing to pay to expedite this. I would offer a patch, but that's a paradox, because this feature is the thing holding me back from my first foray into RethinkDB (i.e., I know little about the source, etc.)."
