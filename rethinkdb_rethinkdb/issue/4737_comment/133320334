      "You can only provide one server to `r.connect`. If it is down, you need to handle the error provided by `r.connect` to the callback function and try to connect to another server.\r\nThere is no `table` argument by the way.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is rethinkdbdash (https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash), a third-party driver that comes with a connection pool which handles such cases automatically."
