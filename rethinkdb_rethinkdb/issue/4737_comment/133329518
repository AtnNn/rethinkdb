      "Does the following connection logic make sense, and is it the best way to do this?\r\n\r\n    var hosts = ['10.0.0.1', '10.0.0.2', '10.0.0.3'];\r\n\r\nRandomly grab one of the hosts out of the `hosts` array and try to connect. If the connection fails, grab another from the hosts array excluding the first host and retry. If that still fails, grab the last host from the array and try to connect. If finally that fails, `return callback(error);`"
