      "@runvnc the source code for RethinkDB and Horizon will remain open source. The docs will also continue to be available and hosted at [rethinkdb.com](https://rethinkdb.com/) for *at least* the next couple months as we transition (if we can't acquire the domain, we'll work something else out). The goal is to continue making everything accessible in much the same way it always has been."
