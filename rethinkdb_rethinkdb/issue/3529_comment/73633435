      "Moving to 2.0.\r\n\r\n@larkost , @coffeemug , @timmaxw, @mlucy and I concluded in an offline discussion that we should have an optarg `cursor.next(wait=False)` to make the element retrieval non-blocking.\r\nThis would complement the native async support for reading from cursors.\r\n\r\nIf there's no element, `cursor.next(wait=False)` will throw an exception.\r\n\r\nAn open question is if you should be able to pass a timeout instead of `False`. I don't think it's necessary, but also don't oppose it if it's easy to do."
