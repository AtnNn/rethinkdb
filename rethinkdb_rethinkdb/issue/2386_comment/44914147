      "Implemented and merged into `next` in commit 2ccd76d.  Review was 1575.  Will be in release 1.13.\r\n\r\nLeaving this open as it appears I broke the `r.http` tests (if not in this issue, then another).  Most of it looks like the tests just need to be updated, but I'm going to take a close look to see if any of the behavior is wrong."
