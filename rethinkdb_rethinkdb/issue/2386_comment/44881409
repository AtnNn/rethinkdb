      "> If you have 1000 users, each of this request is going to perform 1000 http requests...\r\n\r\nThese types of queries are really nice for interactively enriching data via APIs, and it's not too crazy to do it for 1000 users. It wouldn't work too well now because the requests happen serially, but after @srh's parallelization changes they'll happen in batches which will be awesome."
