      "As part of depaginate, the http extprocs will be returning the headers to the protocol layer.  I would just have an error return the headers and the body as a string (and truncate over some length, 10K, maybe?).  An extra optarg *could* be useful, but I feel like users would be annoyed at having to change and rerun their queries to get all the info."
