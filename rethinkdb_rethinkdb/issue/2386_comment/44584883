      "We really want two classes of errors: recoverable and non-recoverable errors.  I think HTTP errors should be recoverable, because they're hard to predict, so you should be able to use `default` to specify a default value rather than aborting your whole operation (e.g. if you're doing a big `map` with an `r.http` call for every row)."
