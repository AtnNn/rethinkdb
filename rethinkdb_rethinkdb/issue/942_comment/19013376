      "I think we should remove all the callbacks if the connection is closed.\r\n\r\nPeople should never write code like that. It's just not how JavaScript works.\r\n```javascript\r\nr.connect (e, c) ->\r\n    q1.run(c, q1Done)\r\n    q2.run(c, q2Done)\r\n    c.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne more reason to clean callbacks is if the connection is somehow closed for whatever reason (like a net split), the user should just have to reconnect, not to clean the callbacks and reconnect.\r\nIt can be a lot of pain to access the cursor to call `.close()`.\r\n\r\nIt's beyond the scope of this issue, so we should probably open a new issue for that."
