      "We don't clear callbacks when the connection is closed, only on cancel. Otherwise if you wrote this:\r\n\r\n```coffeescript\r\nr.connect (e, c) ->\r\n    q1.run(c, q1Done)\r\n    q2.run(c, q2Done)\r\n    c.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe would throw out the two callbacks and they would never be called. When you call close we go into a half closed state in which we won't accept new queries but do accept responses to previously run queries. When all open queries have been closed we then close the underlying socket."
