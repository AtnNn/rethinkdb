      "Just for posterity, the user doesn't actually need to run `rethinkdb create`. It will get run automatically via `rethinkdb` executable for the first time if the database doesn't exist. The directory passed to `rethinkdb` via `-d` has to exist, but I believe that's standard for unix tools. I believe this will be less of a problem when we take care of #187."
