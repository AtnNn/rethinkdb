      "Thanks, we'll review the patch shortly. Could you clarify the motivation for it? What do you mean by \"choking on / in the path\"? We'd need to do some testing on legacy systems with our packaging system (because boost is known to change APIs, etc.). In general, we're reluctant to expand boost library dependencies without a strong motivation.\r\n\r\nAlso, agreed on init.d, and also Makefile. Both aren't our strongest code :)"
