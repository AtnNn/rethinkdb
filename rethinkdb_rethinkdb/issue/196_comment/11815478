      "/var/lib/rethinkdb/instances.d was initially created by the installation. I don't remember what happened that got me wanting that \"mkdir -p\" behavior.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the user is supposed to `rethinkdb create -d /var/lib/rethinkdb/instances.d/default` which is not nice in my opinion but that's related to the pull request https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/199\r\n\r\nSince the user has to type this during the installation, should `rethinkdb create -d /some/dir` behave like \"mkdir -p\" or \"mkdir\"."
