      "I forgot the -d. Sorry about that.\r\n\r\nIf the user wants a rethinkdb instance created somewhere, he will need to do something. It is hard to make it much simpler than running rethinkdb create with the target path.\r\n\r\nmkdir -p would be non-standard and probably undesirable here. Uncommanded recursive directory creation can hide path mistakes and can also lead to incorrect ownership and permissions.\r\n"
