      "I meant that /var/lib/rethinkdb/instances.d gets created for standard packages in my design and testing. If this is not happening for @nviennot somehow, then there is a problem somewhere between my design and his installation.\r\n\r\nBut, anyway, the design idea was that /var/lib/rethinkdb/instances.d would exist at installation and that the user could create the database by running rethinkdb create /var/lib/rethinkdb/instances.d/default or something like that."
