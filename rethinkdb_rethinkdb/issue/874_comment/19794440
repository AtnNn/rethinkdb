      "Alright, here's the summary:\r\n* `upcase` -- mlucy, Slava, ruby\r\n* `upper` -- python\r\n* `to_upper` -- Joe, Slava\r\n* `to_upper_case` -- JS, Michel\r\n\r\nSince the discussion period is over, and there's no real consensus, I arbitrarily pick `upcase`, since two people liked it and it's the name used by one of our client languages.  The corresponding command will be `downcase`."
