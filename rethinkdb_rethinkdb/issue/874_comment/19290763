      "> What about `iDesireThatWhichIsMyFirstArgumentToBeUpperCasePlease`?\r\n\r\nI'm cool with that, but only as long as we change every other command we have to end with `Please`. It's actually really nice:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.tablePlease('foo')\r\nr.tablePlease('foo').getPlease('bar')\r\nr.tablePlease('foo').getPlease('bar').updatePlease({ 'politeness': 'yes' })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's a lot to be said for a codebase with good manners."
