      "Something which might be interesting about locale-dependency:\r\nIn PHP, there are two functions. `strtolower` http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtolower.php\r\nand `mb_strtolower` http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mb-strtolower.php .\r\n\r\nThe former depends on the locale, the latter does not:\r\n> By contrast to strtolower(), 'alphabetic' is determined by the Unicode character properties. Thus the behaviour of this function is not affected by locale settings and it can convert any characters that have 'alphabetic' property, such as A-umlaut (\196).\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about Unicode to fully understand the implications here, but there seems to be a way of doing this in a locale-independent way.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: Actually there is a comment on that page which gives an example of why locale matters:\r\n> Turkish is a good example of this.  In Turkish, the letter I/i has a dotted-upper-case form (\304) and a dotless-lower-case form (\305).\r\n> \r\n> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I\r\n> \r\n> This means that you cannot correctly convert between upper-case and lower-case without also knowing the locale of the data.\r\n> \r\n> Since the function does not let you specify a locale, you should only use this function for text written in languages that follow the same orthography as English.\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess this is kind of tricky."
