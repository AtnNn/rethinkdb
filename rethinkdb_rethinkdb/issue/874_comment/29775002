      "So yeah I guess I would be ok with this limited toupper/tolower, but it still feels like a bad compromise.\r\nI think the behavior of PHP's mb_strtolower would be almost strictly preferable. It still has limitations, but it sets the bar a lot higher and isn't dependent on locale. If we could find a reasonable easy way of getting that behavior without huge additional libraries I think we should do that.\r\n\r\nAlso note that 55% of the web content being English doesn't mean that 55% of web services can get away with supporting *only* English. Many web services have to deal with multiple languages, even though *most* of their content might be English. That aside, I did of course exaggerate with the 5% and the truth is probably somewhere in between."
