      "Oh, that's cool then.  (Note that we won't be able to link against different versions of ICU on different platforms unless we are 100% sure that they always produce the same output given the same input (see my previous comment about data divergence).  I'm not sure how much of a wrench that throws into the packaging.)\r\n\r\nPython 3.2.3 on Newton appears not to upper-case or lower-case Unicode characters either:\r\n```python\r\n>>> a = 'gr\\303\\274\\303\\237EN\\n'.encode('utf-8')\r\n>>> a\r\nb'gr\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\xbc\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\x9fEN\\n'\r\n>>> a.upper()\r\nb'GR\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\xbc\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\x9fEN\\n'\r\n>>> a.lower()\r\nb'gr\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\xbc\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\x9fen\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know enough Go to test easily, but I would give it even odds that it doesn't touch Unicode characters when upper/lower-casing either.\r\n\r\nThe other objections (setting expectations, locale-dependency, and unintuitive behavior) still stand.\r\n\r\n"
