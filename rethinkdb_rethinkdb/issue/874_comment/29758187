      "I think that writing unicode-aware case-manipulation is beyond the scope of this issue.  We would probably have to link against an enormous library and/or change all the ReQL code to use something besides an `std::string`.\r\n\r\nBeing locale-dependent is a problem.  Would anyone be strongly opposed to just setting our locale to \"C\" on startup?  I think that basically any time our code would branch on a locale, here or elsewhere, it would be better not to."
