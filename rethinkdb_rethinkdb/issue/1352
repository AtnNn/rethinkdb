If I use filter command as follows (have already setup conn.use(dbName)):\n\nr.table(tableName).filter(filter).run(conn, function(err, result){\n if(err) {\n   console.log(err);\n } else {\n  console.log(result);\n }\n}\n\nThe result is a large object of the type:\n\n{ _conn: \n   { host: 'localhost',\n     port: 28015,\n     db: 'starter_app',\n     authKey: '',\n     timeout: 20,\n     outstandingCallbacks: {},\n     nextToken: 5,\n     open: true,\n     buffer: \n      { '0': 241,\n         ..........\n\nThe browser gives me correct result as expected however.\n\nI am using latest RethinkDB 1.7.1\n\nAny suggestions on how I may try to debug this ?\n\nThanks!\n"
