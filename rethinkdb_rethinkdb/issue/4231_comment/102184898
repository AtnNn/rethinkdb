      "It looks like the `region` field on the `sindex_rangespec_t` is being used as one of the bounds for the `btree_depth_first_traversal()`, and `btree_depth_first_traversal()` is in turn passing it to `filter_range()`. @danielmewes, how do you think we should solve this? We can hack around it as a special case, by making `any_query_cell_intersects()` detect the bounds of the rangespec. Or we could try to make `any_query_cell_intersects()` tolerate arbitrary inputs."
