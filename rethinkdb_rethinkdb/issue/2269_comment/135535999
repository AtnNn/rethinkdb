      "I like extending `default` more than adding `catch` just because we already have too many goddamn terms, and in general it seems unnecessarily complicated to have multiple constructs for error handling.\r\n\r\nThe question of whether `default` should handle `NaN` and `Inf` errors is less obvious to me, but it feels right.  I think of dividing by 0 as being in the same class of errors as reducing over an empty list or a variety of other edge cases that produce non-existence errors."
