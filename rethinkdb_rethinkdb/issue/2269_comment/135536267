      "> Making NaN a non-existence error makes sense to me (your answer isn't a number, would you like to provide a default?). I think Inf is a borderline conceptually, but I think making a whole separate exception type is splitting hairs, so I vote for both becoming NonExistence errors.\r\n\r\nI don't particularly object, so I guess the current state of the proposal for the first implementation is literally just \"change several numeric errors to be non-existence errors\"."
