      "> People are likely to not think about edge cases in floating point math, so explicit errors would be nice.\r\n\r\nIn my experience that's not what people want for these queries. Most of the time they don't have control of the data (they get whatever's in the source), and when the query blows up they think \"errr, why do I have to deal with this, I just want to easily set the default!\"\r\n\r\nI think the question of which numeric errors to support initially isn't that important since we'll eventually add a way to explicitly list which errors to catch, so I'd just do whatever's easiest from the development POV for now."
