      "@mlucy Yes. I I think having `Inf` throw a non existence error would be extremely weird. I think it makes a more sense for `NaN`, because you can get it by dividing by `0`, which is often similar to not having a value. Like you said:\r\n>  I think of dividing by 0 as being in the same class of errors as reducing over an empty list or a variety of other edge cases that produce non-existence errors.\r\n\r\nThis argumentation doesn't apply to `Inf` at all as far as I can tell."
