      "I think 99.99% of the time people encounter `NaN` or `Inf` in ReQL calculations, it won't be because they're doing some sort of complicated scientific computing task that occasionally generates `NaN` in the course of regular operation, it will be because they're doing bog-standard division and a 0 ended up in the denominator.  I think that you probably want `default` to handle that case.\r\n\r\nI don't have a particularly strong opinion on making them non-existence eorrs vs. some new numeric type."
