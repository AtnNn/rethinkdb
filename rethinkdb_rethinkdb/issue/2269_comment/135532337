      "@deontologician -- the question is what `default` should catch by default.  I think it should probably catch these `INF` and `NaN` errors by default, but probably shouldn't catch e.g. adding a string to a number.  So even if we make `default` work for everything we still need to decide whether to define these errors as non-existence errors to make `default` catch them by default, or whether to make a new error class and say that `default` also catches that error class by default."
