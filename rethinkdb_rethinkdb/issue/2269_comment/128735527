      "@danielmewes I have also run into this issue (erroring when dividing by zero) while using ```map``` to calculate data analytics before returning the results of a somewhat large query. In brief, I am grouping certain data by U.S. state; however, if one particular state does not have data for a particular range (e.g., attempting to get ```x``` per ```y```, or ```x.div(y)```, when ```y``` is apparently ```0```), I get the ```RqlRuntimeError``` for dividing by zero. Is there a more graceful way to handle this than conditional statements? Can I use ```default``` to handle numeric errors, yet, or is that something (potentially) planned for the future?\r\n\r\nOtherwise loving RethinkDB!"
