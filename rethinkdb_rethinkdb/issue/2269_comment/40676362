      "JSON numbers can't be Infinity or NaN.  If we allowed storing those in our JSON documents, we'd be letting people store documents that their language might not be able to deal with.  We could plausibly introduce a pseudotype, but that seems like overkill.\r\n\r\nAdding something like `default` to handle numeric errors sounds like the best option to me.\r\n\r\n@neumino -- `0/0` usually produces NaN"
