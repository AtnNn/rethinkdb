      "A ``ReqlZeroDivisionError``caught by ``default`` would, I think, completely resolve the issue for me. We've encountered it several times in our project(s), and have had to come up with workarounds that might potentially become bottlenecks. I really appreciate the thought and attention that you all have given to this issue. Looking forward to how things proceed. :+1: "
