      "Actually another thing we could consider is to check for divisions by 0 explicitly in `div` and `mod`, and to delay general handling of `Inf` and `NaN` errors for later (maybe when we extend `default` to catch arbitrary error types).\r\n\r\nThis might make it easier to justify treating those errors as non-existence errors, which would reduce the amount of changes we would have to do to our code base and error hierarchy.\r\nHowever I think doing this would still be a bit odd."
