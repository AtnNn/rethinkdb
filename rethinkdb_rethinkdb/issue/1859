I know mongodb had some hard coded settings that if a machine was more then X seconds behind it would not handle reads or something funny like that. What would be great in rethink is if usesing the use outdated flag if its set to true it does not care how outdated the read is but if its set to a postive interager then the node cant be more then that many seconds out of date."
