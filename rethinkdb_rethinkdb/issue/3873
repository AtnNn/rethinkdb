Trying to load a table with 1.4M docs causes this\r\n\r\n![selection_023](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1366/6476825/a2285676-c1cf-11e4-9d81-343a0fd1269d.png)\r\n\r\nI'm still investigating whether this is a regression and which part of the code is causing it. I believe it's happening in loading the results. It also only happens sporadically.\r\n"
