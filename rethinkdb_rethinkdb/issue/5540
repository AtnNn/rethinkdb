        "Drop is a well established database convention for deleting data. However most folk aren't DBAs, 'drop' doesn't sound sufficiently clear for a destructive action, nor is the term 'drop' consistent with the rest of technology where 'delete' or 'remove' is used. \n\nThere's also the obvious code smell:\n\n> Drop a database. The database, all its tables, and corresponding data will be deleted.\n> \n> Drop a table from a database. The table and all its data will be deleted.\n\nI.e. if the documentation has to state what the function does, the name's not obviously explicit.\n\n'Drop' was always a bad name for deleting DBs, tables, records etc. The new DBs give us an opportunity to do better.\n\nObviously this is a significant change, so a deprecation warning would probably be a good first step. \n"
