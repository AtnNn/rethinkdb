      "@danielmewes Unfortunately, the `r.args` command does not resolve the issue with the stack overflow. If I insert the ids list with `r.args` instead of `...ids` I still get the same error. I believe internally `r.args` simply does the same things as `...ids` (i.e. call `function.apply`).\r\n\r\nPlus this is an issue that is caused by the way RDBOp in the js library handles its incoming arguments. It expects variadic arguments. And this is precisely not possible if you have 100k arguments. And no matter how the input is transformed, to construct an AST you will still have to call RDBOp to create the operator for the selection query."
