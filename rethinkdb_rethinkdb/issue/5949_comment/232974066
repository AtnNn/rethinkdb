      "For now I work around this issue by chunking the ids into lists of 10k ids and doing updates with those. From my profiling the more ids the better the performance really. Although marginal at 1k+. But it greatly simplifies some of the query construction code if we can make a query in one step. Instead of working with a list of queries."
