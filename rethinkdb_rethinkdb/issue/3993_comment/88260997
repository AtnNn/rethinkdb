      "We currently offer no guarantees about what order changes that occur at the same time will be sent in (the initial values of the changefeed are considered to be \"changes\" that occur at the same time).  But this would be pretty easy to fix for the initial-value case (we just have to iterate over the initial set in reverse order in this case) and it would probably be more intuitive for people."
