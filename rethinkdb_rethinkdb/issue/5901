However, the output query string is not syntactically correct.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n>>> query = r.db('test').table('test').filter(r.row.has_fields('test'))\n>>> print(query)\nr.db('test').table('test').filter(lambda var_1: r.row.has_fields('test'))\n\n(copy and run this query):\n>>> r.db('test').table('test').filter(lambda var_1: r.row.has_fields('test')).run()\nReqlServerCompileError: Cannot use r.row in nested queries.  Use functions instead in:\nr.db('test').table('test').filter(lambda var_1: r.row.has_fields('test'))\n                                                ^^^^^                    \n```\n\nThe correct query should probably be:\n`r.db('test').table('test').filter(lambda var_1: var_1.has_fields('test'))`\n\nI think it always happens when a `.filter()` does not use lambda.\n"
