        "1. Geo terms should be marked non-deterministic, see discussion in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3009\r\n2. We currently overload subtraction `sub()` for polygons. It is required for constructing polygons with holes. Since we don't want to mark all of `sub` non-deterministic, I propose we introduce a new ReQL term. I suggest `geo_sub` or `polygon_sub` as its name (the semantics would be just like the current `sub` on polygons).\r\n\r\nI'm briefly marking this as RQL_proposal because of 2, but we should decide this really quickly.\r\n@mlucy @coffeemug what's your opinion on part 2?"
