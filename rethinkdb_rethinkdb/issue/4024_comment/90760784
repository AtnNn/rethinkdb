      "Unfortunately not; `r.js` can't call back into ReQL code to do joins.  The server just doesn't support this behavior at the moment, so generating nested queries on the client is about the best you can do.  (We also don't really optimize for this case, so I wouldn't be shocked if there were performance problems for deeply nested joins.)\r\n\r\nYou could also consider not doing the join on the server, and instead just reading the values in on the client and issue new read queries as needed."
