      "We do tell the operating system to unpage most of the coroutine stack now, so we might get away with just making the stacks really big. I'd still be cautious with this though, since we don't have a guarantee that the OS actually obeys our hints and we don't know if it does so immediately or with a delay etc.\r\n\r\nIf we don't want to impose a hard limit on recursion depth, we could spawn a new fresh coroutine after a certain call depth in the QL code and continue evaluating the subtree in that coroutine."
