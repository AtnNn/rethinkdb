      "Talked with @mlucy about this.\r\n\r\nWe think that we should do the following:\r\nEvery time `eval` is called on a term, we should check that we have at least a certain amount of stack space available on the current coroutine (say 4 KB).\r\nI'm not sure if our coroutines already have a method for getting that information, but it should be easy to add. The underlying implementation definitely has functions for getting the stack boundaries.\r\nIf we don't have enough stack space available, we can throw an exception and stop the query.\r\n\r\nAssigning @Tryneus ."
