      "Hi @niieani ,\r\n\r\nIn the first case you're generating a very deeply nested query that's probably breaking something on the server (maybe https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2639 ?).  We should detect those queries and reject them, probably.  (Putting this into 1.16.x since hanging forever on a query seems like a bug to me even if it's really deeply nested like that.)\r\n\r\nIn the second case you're actually recursing forever in the JS client; the `r.branch` gets run on the server, but to construct it the JS client is recursing right away to try and generate one of the branches.  We've talked about adding first-class functions to the server, which would make this possible, but it isn't on the roadmap right now.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't think there's anything to do on this except to keep the number of recursions small for now."
