      "Hi @mlucy,\r\n\r\nThanks for getting back to me so quickly. Would you have any suggestions on how I could achieve the same effect in any other, better way? I've just looked at the docs, there's the ```r.js```, which, as I understand, seems to be computed on the server. Is it possible it could help me in any way to construct a recursive function on the server, rather than on the client?"
