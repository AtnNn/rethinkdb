        "In `raft` we currently don't show issues in the web UI if there are problems with table configuration. This needs to be fixed.\n\nThis is a bit tricky because we can no longer check the table config on each server separately; instead, the servers hosting the data have to check the table config and then forward the issues over the network to the server reporting the issues. We already have a mechanism for this: the local issue tracker logic. But it's still a non-trivial amount of work.\n\nProbably this should be done after https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3897.\n"
