      "@mlucy Thanks, I see. I agree that we shouldn't do that for `merge`. Using `nil` to remove a field is quite useful.\r\n\r\n@neumino Thanks for explaining.\r\n@mlucy What are the actual semantics of `a.merge(b, c)`? It seems like it's equivalent to `a.merge(b).merge(c)` in some respect, but doesn't obey the same error handling characteristics. Is that just a bug?"
