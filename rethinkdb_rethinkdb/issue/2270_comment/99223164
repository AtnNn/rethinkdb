      "@danielmewes -- we try to make `{a: nil, b: 1}` act the same as `{b: 1}` when possible.  Making `{a: 1, b: 1}.merge({b: 2})` act the same as `{a: 1, b: 1}.merge({a: nil, b: 2})` would be an extension of that that would make the language feel consistent in some ways.  We probably shouldn't do it, though, since people currently write `.merge({a: nil})` to effectively remove a field and we'd break a *lot* of code."
