      "The right way to do this is to properly define ternary logic so we get a nice user experience without `default`s everywhere, and no surprising pernicious edge cases (generally tracked in #1721).\r\n\r\nI still maintain that `x.merge(null)` should evaluate to `x`. I'm not sure what `null.merge(x)` should evaluate to."
