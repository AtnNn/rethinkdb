      "Regarding the case of `r.expr([1, 2]).sample(3)`, my suggestion is to either add a second parameter to sample(), bool \"upTo\" or some such, to return as many records as possible instead of throwing an error, or to simply make that the default behavior, and let the user check the number of records returned in their program if they care. \r\n\r\nI'm unsure which is preferable, but my gut feeling is the latter, as I'm having trouble imagining cases where one _needs_ exactly N random records, for N > 1, but I can easily imagine, e.g., \"show five random recommendations for the user, or as many as we have\""
