      "I just talked to Slava, and he thinks shuffling is still a good idea for `sample` even if we don't allow a 0-arity version.  I can imagine people assuming this behavior (which they will basically get for large streams) and then getting funky results on small streams, so I think we should do that.\r\n\r\nA revised summary:\r\n```ruby\r\n# Sampling without replacement, operates on any sequence.  Returns an array if passed an array, a stream if passed a stream, and a selection if passed a selection.\r\n> r([1,2,3]).sample(2)\r\n[3, 1] # shuffled\r\n> r([1, 2, 3]).sample(4)\r\n[1, 3, 2] # shuffled\r\n```"
