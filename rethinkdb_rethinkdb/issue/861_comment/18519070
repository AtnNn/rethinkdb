      "So I'm a bit confused about this final api unless I'm mistaken there's no\r\nmention anywhere in this issue of adding a `random` term and I was hoping\r\nto ignore that to have less to implement here.\r\n\r\nAlso it seems like we were on the fence about throwing vs returning few\r\nelements but the last thing @coffeemug said was let's just throw.\r\n\r\nFinally I really think we should ignore `sample()` for now. As I said\r\npreviously its going to very easily run you out of memory because it\r\nrequires storing everything in memory. We can fix this by adding memory\r\ncaps but I think we can reasonably ignore this for now if we only allow\r\ncapped sampling which I'd like to do to keep things simple."
