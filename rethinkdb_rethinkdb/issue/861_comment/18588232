      "@spiffytech it's definitely a feature we'd like to add. Unfortunately it's actually very hard for us to implement that without storing the data in memory. If you have to store all of the data in memory then it's really hardly useful because it will either get you killed by the OOM killer or will have a prohibitively low cap. We can get around this it's just a big undertaking and while we do like the feature unfortunately right now the cost benefit isn't such that we can really put it anywhere in the roadmap but \"future\"; at least I don't think we can. Sorry I can't give you a more satisfying answer here, we will implement this eventually I promise."
