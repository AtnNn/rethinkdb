      "I suppose I had associated this with #865 in my head.  I think we need a random term at some point, but if we don't want it for 1.6 I'm cool with that.\r\n\r\nRegarding throwing, here's what people said:\r\n\r\nSlava:\r\n> I think throwing is fine for now, let's not overcomplicate things by adding a strict argument (if we did, man would that be a can of worms). EDIT: I'd be cool with non-throwing one too. Just not a flag.\r\n\r\n@spiffytech seemed to want non-throwing.\r\n\r\nAfter reading what @spiffytech said, I think that if we aren't providing a flag then non-throwing might be better.  If we don't throw by default and you want to throw, it's very easy to branch on the size of the resulting array and throw.  In contrast, if we throw by default and you don't want to throw, then you're in a lot of trouble if you're trying to sample a potentially-large stream.  (You can't just count the stream and branch on that because you can only evaluate a stream once, so after you've counted it you can't decide to sample it.)\r\n\r\nI would be cool with not implementing `.sample` with no arguments.  In that case we probably don't need to do shuffling either."
