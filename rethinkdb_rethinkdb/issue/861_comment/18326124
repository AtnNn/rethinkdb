      "A few thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. We've got lots of other things to do for this sprint, so I'd leave replacement until later. Let's ship this as is, and deal with replacement when someone demands it.\r\n2. I think throwing is fine for now, let's not overcomplicate things by adding a `strict` argument (if we did, man would that be a can of worms). EDIT: I'd be cool with non-throwing one too. Just not a flag.\r\n3. `.sample()` with no parameters that just returns things in random order would be nice, if we can get that done easily (seems like it would be easy since it's basically `table.sample(table.count())`)"
