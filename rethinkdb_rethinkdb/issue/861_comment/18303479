      "So if we have `default` then you'd write:\r\n\r\n`table.sample(n).default(table)`\r\n\r\nsince if you have fewer than `n` elements you just want to sample all of them. So it's not that bad. That being said we could also add a flag. I was pretty iffy on whether I preferred to error or return fewer elements but for some reason I'm switching to returning the fewer elements by default and having a flag for strictness. I.e\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n>>> r.expr([1,2,3]).sample(4).run()\r\n[1,2,3]\r\n>>> r.expr([1,2,3]).sample(4, strict=True).run()\r\nError not enough elements to sample.\r\n```\r\n"
