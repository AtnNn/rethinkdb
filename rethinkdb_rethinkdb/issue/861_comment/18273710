      "I think the API is great. A couple of questions/notes:\r\n\r\n1. What happens if I do `r.expr([1, 2]).sample(3)`?\r\n2. We should test `.sample(-1)` and such if we don't already (I assume this returns an error?).\r\n3. A `O (k log N)` complexity (where `k` is the number of shards) is *immensely* more useful than `O(N)`. I know it requires adding a new ICL-level command and doing some B-Tree magic, but I think it could be done in a couple of days and given the huge increase in usefulness, the engineering time is justifiable. (Especially since a log-time version of `sample` is clearly advertisable, where as a linear-time version is a lot less clearly so). @pixelspark, @namtih58, @spiffytech -- how important do you think it is for this command to be logarithmic with respect to document count, as opposed to linear?"
