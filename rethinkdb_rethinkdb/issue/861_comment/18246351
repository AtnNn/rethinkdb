      "I propose the following function be added to reql to allow people to do a bit of random sampling:\r\n\r\n`sample` will be a function present on all sequences which takes a single `number` (`n`) as its argument. It returns a sequence of length `n` containing elements chosen from the stream with uniform random distribution. If the sequence passed has fewer than `n` elements in it we throw an error.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n>>> r.expr([1,2,3]).sample(2).run()\r\n[2,3] \r\n```"
