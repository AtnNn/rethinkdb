      "Hi @yograterol, thank you for your pull request!\r\n\r\nThis solution isn't very practical unfortunately since it requires manual updating for every new version.\r\nWhat we need is something similar to this line from the web UI makefile https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/mk/webui.mk#L89 that injects the RethinkDB version as part of the make process.\r\n\r\nHave you signed our CLA http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/ yet? We'll need that before we can merge a pull request."
