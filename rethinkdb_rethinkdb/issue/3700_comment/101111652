      "> I also don't follow why `t.map(t.count())` shouldn't work.\r\n\r\nBecause the semantics aren't clear -- do we evaluate `t.count()` once, or once per row? If we do the former, it's inconsistent with what happens if we pass a function (which we'll evaluate once per row). If we do the latter, it's super-inefficient.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to forbid all this stuff, and special cause `true` in filter."
