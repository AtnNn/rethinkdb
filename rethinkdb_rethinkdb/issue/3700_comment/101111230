      "I think that's too complicated. It makes something complex to explain even more complex to explain. What is a \"complex term\"?\r\nI also don't follow why `t.map(t.count())` shouldn't work. That seems perfectly fine to me, and I don't see a reason for wrapping it into a function since it's completely independent of the function's argument and the `map` itself cannot change the state of the table `t` in the middle either.\r\n\r\nI think `for_each` is special because it's specifically for functions with side effects.\r\nI like making `map` work like `filter` and making `for_each` work like `map` does now (i.e. fail on non-function arguments)."
