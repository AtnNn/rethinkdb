      "This is actually kind of tricky.\r\n\r\n- It seems obvious to me that `t.map(1)` and `t.filter(true)` should work. Also `t.filter(1)` should be consistent with our definition of truthiness.\r\n- It also seems obvious to me that `t.map(t.count())` shouldn't work -- users should either write `t.map(lambda x: t.count())` or `t.count().do(lambda x: t.map(x))`.\r\n- It seems obvious that `t.foreach(t1.insert(...))` shouldn't work -- users should write `t.foreach(lambda x: t1.insert(...))`\r\n\r\nI think we should accept constants but not complex terms, if that's easy to do.
