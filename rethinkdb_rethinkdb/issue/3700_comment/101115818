      "I think forbidding complex terms is more trouble than it's worth for the marginal benefit it will provide to the one person in the next 10 years who types `t.map(t.count())` and gets angry because it works and is fast.  I think I agree with @danielmewes that we should make `t.map(DATUM)` work in general and special-case `foreach` because you can put writes in it."
