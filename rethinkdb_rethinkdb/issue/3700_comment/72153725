      "I'm not opposed to this specific case, but we should think about what our evaluation semantics are in general.  There are lots of other places (like `map`) where we do the same thing, and where that's usually what you want.  Should we adopt the general rule that expressions passed to terms that can take functions are evaluated `n` times, or should we special-case `for_each`?  (Or should we do neither?)"
