      "There are two counter-arguments to returning an error for `for_each`:\r\n1. The magic that we do for `r.row` makes it difficult to convey this to users and makes it non-discoverable. @danielmewes and I both ran into this, if we trip over this internally then users are going to hit it and not understand.\r\n2. From the user's side this seems arbitrary. We have good internal technical reasons, but if we want to make the database \"seem like magic\" this seems to be an obvious place to do so.\r\n\r\nThe second argument also applies to `map`. We do need to restrict `insert`/`replace`/`update` queries for solid reasons. But after that the main arguments seem to be either because that is what we do now or internal, surmountable, technical ones."
