      "@coffeemug -- if you write `r.table('test').map(r.table('test').count())`, we call `count` once rather than `n` times.  We have a general rule that `r.table('test').map(Q) <=> Q.do(lambda q: r.table('test').map(lambda x: q))`, and a specific rule that we forbid writes inside of `map` (and other stream ops).  The general rule is confusing here, though.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be opposed to special-casing `for_each` to reject non-functions."
