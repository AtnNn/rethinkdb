      "Traditionally we used to have a shortcut for `r.expr(1)` -- you could also write `r(1)`. This is tricky when you do `import rethinkdb as r` so we removed the magic to make that work, and @neumino must have forgotten. I'd just remove the offending two tests for the Python driver because they don't really make sense."
