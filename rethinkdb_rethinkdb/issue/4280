        "In the Node.js API I've noticed that rethink exposes a node-compatible eventEmitter API for all cursors (?) or at least the changeFeed cursor.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I need to make the case to this team of why it would be beneficial to have a less error prone API available. There is a wealth of anecdotal literature on the pains and leaky-abstraction of event emitters. A principled composable API would be great and I think FRP would make a good candidate. CSP would be another candidate but it is a much narrower community in JS right now (given it requires ES6 generators, there is only one major library for it in Node).\r\n\r\nThere are 5 or so high quality FRP libs in JavaScript, the best for rethink might be Kefir due to its excellent project quality and by-far best performance:\r\n\r\nhttps://rpominov.github.io/kefir/\r\n\r\nOthers include `flyd` `rxjs` `bacon` and `highland`.\r\n\r\nI realize this may well be an impossible ask and too radical to consider but thought I'd see if there's any interest in discussing... You did pick `Bluebird` for promises. Unfortunately there is no FRP standard like Promises A+ (yet).\r\n\r\nThanks."
