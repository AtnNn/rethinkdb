      "@akbarahmed It seems that the problem is that the connection is still open. \r\nClosing the connection when you are done should solve the problem:\r\n```js\r\n#!/usr/bin/env node\r\n\r\nvar r = require('rethinkdb');\r\n\r\nvar connection = null;\r\nr.connect( {host: 'localhost', port: 28015}, function(err, conn) {\r\n    if (err) throw err;\r\n    connection = conn;\r\n    conn.close();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not too familiar with what behavior is expected in Node for things like this (@deontologician do you know more?)."
