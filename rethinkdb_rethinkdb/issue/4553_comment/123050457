      "Talked to @deontologician about this and it looks like we're registering an event listener on the socket to receive data. We don't know whether it's the event listener or the existence of the socket itself that's keeping node from exiting.\r\nIf it's just that event listener, we could theoretically unregister it whenever there are no running queries and we don't expect any responses from the server. That sounds like it would add some complexity though.\r\n\r\nPutting into backlog for now."
