        "The actual status quo is that rpm was taken out of build machinery and is created using `scripts/build-rpm.sh`. In this script, the configuration is prescribed by calling configure with specific parameters.\n\nFor deb distrubutions, packaging is part of make, so it respect configure. When I want different static (like, do not want to fetch and build v8 statically), or I am content with directories configure normally finds `/usr/local`, `/usr/local/var`, I had to edit the script, but then, the generated rpm is added `-dirty` into filename (I know there are workarounds).\n\nIt would be nice if making rpm would be part of make as one of the steps, without prescribed `./configure`.\n"
