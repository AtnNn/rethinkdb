      "Note that the limitation is problematic in .NET since it's idiomatic to use `DateTime.MinValue` to indicate that a date has not been set. This translates to `0001-01-01T00:00:00` (note that the timezone is unspecified). Thus your assumption that few people will be using dates before 1400 doesn't quite hold."
