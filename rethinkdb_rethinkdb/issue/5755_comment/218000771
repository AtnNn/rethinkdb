      "Hi @alf, perhaps using a **nullable** `DateTime?` type would be better to indicate a date has not been set?\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, it would be equally (if not more) idiomatic in .NET to use a **nullable** type rather than `DateTime.MinValue`. A **nullable** `DateTime?` type could be used to avoid the more problematic value like `DateTime.MinValue` that RethinkDB doesn't natively support."
