      "Hi @alf. May I humbly suggest (or you might already know), using the **null conditional operator** `?.` in the **C#** language when working with **nullable** types. It can help maintain similarity to your preferred `if` statement:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDateTime? lastChecked = null;\r\n\r\nif (lastChecked?.AddHours(1) > DateTime.Now)\r\n{\r\n\tConsole.WriteLine(\"do some work\");\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n\tConsole.WriteLine(\"skip work\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only difference is the `?` before the `.AddHours(1)`. But nevertheless, thank you for the unit test and protocol traces. I'll try to investigate more what we can do in the drivers.\r\n\r\nIf I still could offer any advice, guidance, or best practice on this particular subject w.r.t **C#/.NET** **RethinkDB** driver it would still be to use **nullable** types. This is how I ultimately work with issues like this in my applications."
