      "I think it's a good idea to forbid storing such times.\r\nSince we currently allow such times to be stored, this would be a compatiblity-breaking change. I think it's not too critical though. We can implement the check in a way that keeps existing entries working, and only fails when using one of the ReQL date construction terms such as `r.epochTime`.\r\n\r\nMarking as a ReQL_proposal for discussion for one of the upcoming releases.\r\n\r\nFixing the limitation is likely harder and I doubt a lot of people will be using ReQL date functions for dates before 1400."
