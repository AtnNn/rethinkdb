        "After a fresh install on Ubuntu 11.10, I was surprised to see the admin interface (http://localhost:8080/#servers/[server-id]) claim that my server's IP address was 192.168.46.1 (while I was expecting something on the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet).  It turns out 192.168.46.1 is the IP address of \"vmnet1\", a virtual network adapter that VMWare Workstation installed.  I guess RethinkDB is using some heuristic to choose which adapter to report.\r\n\r\nNot sure yet whether this has any practical consequences, but it was at least surprising."
