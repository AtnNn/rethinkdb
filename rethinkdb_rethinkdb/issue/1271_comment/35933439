      "@minibikini yeah that sounds much closer to what it should be. I am guessing it has to do with OSX. Considering how you are using 1.11.3 on both which includes the patch I dont know what would have happened if you tried it before the batch on OSX since it locks my linux server. Now the only differance i can think about is that your fusion drive setup is not working with rethinkdb correctly.I am not sure if its getting into the ssd cache at all since rethinkdb uses its own io subsystem by default which may be by passing the caching system.\r\n\r\nIf you run it with the --no-direct-io flag it will end up in pure memory which we can try to compare if the issue is OSX or Fusion but could be other issues in the way."
