      "@danielmewes in regards to you seeing it take a long time and using a lot of cpu i can confirm that i was doing some testing on some stuff last night. I had the db in --no-direct-io. I had no disk usage (reading from cache), but it still took about 30sec to count 1million objects and noticed i used about 30-40% cpu and 80-90% of that was in user space the rest was in system calls.
