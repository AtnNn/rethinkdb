      "@PrakashThapa This is probably because the intermediate operations cause RethinkDB to compute every result item before counting it. For certain types of operations (specifically `getAll` and `between` operations), we will make counts very fast with https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3949. This is still a few releases away though unfortunately."
