      "You have to block incoming operations on the tree, by holding the lock on the high-level blocks covering the range you're getting the count for.  Or, hypothetically, you could let the query get \"pushed down\" by other queries (if we had the other kind of snapshotting, we would already have code that does this).  But without that, a count query just has to block other queries and let any transactions beneath it drain."
