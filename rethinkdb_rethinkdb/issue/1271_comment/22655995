      "What we're going to do specifically for this issue, specifically related to `.count()` and some other count operations involving range queries (that don't have to manually apply filter functions to every value) is to improve the behavior of `count()` by not having it load the entire document off of disk before adding 1 to an accumulator.  This would help the performance a *lot*."
