      "@minibikini -- a couple of questions:\r\n\r\n* Which OS are you running on? (I assume you're on OS X, correct?)\r\n* Are you on an SSD or rotational drive?\r\n* If you run the query again without restarting RethinkDB, do you get the same performance?\r\n* Have you tried to reproduce this on Linux? If you can, is the behavior the same or different?\r\n\r\nWe had a regression recently of `count` being slow (which was fixed in 1.11.3) and separate reports of `count` being slow on OS X. I'd like to get to the bottom of OS X performance, but we first have to validate that you're encountering an OS X specific issue.\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting and helping us get to the bottom of this!"
