      "@encryptio I took a look at `aropt` but wouldn't passing an object dictonary in a variable still work here? It is the case that\r\n```\r\nObject::toString.call(perhapsOptDict) isnt '[object Object]'\r\n```\r\nwould return false (questionable way to test this btw). Thus the `numPosArguments = 2` which is what the anonymous function for `tableCreate` expects."
