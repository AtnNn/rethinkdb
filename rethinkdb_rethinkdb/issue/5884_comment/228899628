      "It's not that it can discern between the variable and literal cases, it's that optargs aren't encoded as regular arguments in the driver's wire protocol, so the drivers have to split them out to send them over that protocol. Since the JS driver doesn't see a non-ReQL-term object as its last argument, it assumes you meant an extra positional argument when doing the argument splitting.\r\n\r\n_(Edit: after thinking about it, this **is** the ReQL equivalent of discerning between a variable and a literal. Weird.)_\r\n\r\nIf you want to dive into the code, have a look at [the definition of `r.tableCreate`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/d22ca667b08feb9b04add76d45e7cd1c83fdc819/drivers/javascript/ast.coffee#L1273) which uses [a helper function called `aropt`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/d22ca667b08feb9b04add76d45e7cd1c83fdc819/drivers/javascript/util.coffee#L28) that implements the argument splitting logic. After that, [`RDBOp.build`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/d22ca66/drivers/javascript/ast.coffee#L446)  puts each piece in the right place on the wire."
