      "Thank you for your reply. And don't fear, specifying the optional argument with `r.row` does work.\r\n\r\nI find it strange that the function can discern between arguments given explicitly and in an object. Given a function `f` it should not be able to know the difference between `f({})` and `x= {}; f(x)`."
