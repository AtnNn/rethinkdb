      "I'm ok with delaying discussion, this would be a little bit of work as well so I don't think I can do it right away. I think in general the java community is in favor of stronger typing and this is a place I think it's tractable to provide stronger typing. The number of optargs is enumerable and they don't (currently) allow a reql term to dynamically evaluate their value\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think optargs are completely tractable to keep up to date. We have to add docs for each one anyway, so there's a reasonable time we could slap them into the json file and regenerate the java driver"
