      "The contra argument for doing this is that we will need to maintain the list of supported optargs in the future.\r\n\r\nI have a slight preference for keepings the optarg syntax the same it is now, and not introducing specific methods for the different optional arguments.\r\n\r\nLambda optargs are an interesting case. We could offer the proposed optarg syntax only for those arguments, and not for others. On the other hand that would be inconsistent.\r\n\r\nWould you be ok with delaying this discussion until we introduce the first lambda optargs?"
