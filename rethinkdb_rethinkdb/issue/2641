        "See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2597#issuecomment-47690448. Inserting an object with many (20k) properties is really slow, and inserting 10 objects of 20k properties blows the javascript driver (and may be other drivers too).\r\n\r\nOriginally we changed the drivers to convert `t.insert(x)` to `t.insert(r.json(JSON.stringify(x)))` because protobufs were atrocious at encoding nested objects. Perhaps this is something that's hurting us now. Could we benchmark the drivers with and without these calls and see if we can do for @nickpoorman's workload (and beyond)?\r\n\r\n/cc @neumino @Tryneus "
