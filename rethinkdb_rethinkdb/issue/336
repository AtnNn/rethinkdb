        "I've seen code that looks like this (I won't out who wrote it to avoid embarrassing them, but it was totally @mglukhovsky ):\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef foo(...):\r\n   some_query.run()\r\n   return ...\r\n\r\ntable.filter(foo).run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nNaturally this resulted in an implosion of the universe. We should detect calls to `run` from lambdas called by the driver and give people a clear error message and a link to an FAQ section that explains why they shouldn't do this (unless we want to allow doing it for some crazy metaprogramming purposes, which I think is a rather bad idea)."
