Any idea why this would occur. ( I inserted a total of 7070 records out of which  7000 records were inserted  without issues but only 70 records with this date throws the above error)\n\nI definitely know RethinkDB would get the date correct. But i am out of ideas on where to look for the issue. \nMy Machine config \nLinux  3.13.0-37-generic #64-Ubuntu SMP Mon Sep 22 21:28:38 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n"
