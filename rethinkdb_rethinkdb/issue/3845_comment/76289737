      "The `interface.cache_size` size one looks legitimate, my guess is that something is wrong with the cache size reporting. For the record that is getting the `0` from `rethinkdb.stats[\"storage_engine\"][\"cache\"][\"in_use_bytes\"]`.\r\n\r\n`interface.artificial_table` looks like it needs a little tweaking, some of which is done already in `larkost/3157-changefeed-tests`, but I will finish the job.\r\n"
