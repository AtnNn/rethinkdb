      "This is an issue of multiple parts.\r\n\r\nOne part is reading the data from different blobs off of disk simultaneously.  This would help many queries, including export scripts.  This is also *relatively* straightforward.\r\n\r\nThe second part is evaluating transform and terminal functions (as they're called in the source code) simultaneously.  This would require fixing all the problems with `env_t` so that it's a nice sane type that can be used reentrantly, broken down into constituent parts to make refactoring the code and understanding exactly how it's used in certain places easier.\r\n\r\nI'm going to move the second part into a separate issue."
