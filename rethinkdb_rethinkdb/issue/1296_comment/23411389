      "This is implemented in sam_alt_1296, which is branched off of v1.8.x.  The implementation doesn't make \"leaf node iteration\" happen in parallel, it's oblivious to actual leaf node boundaries.  It also tries, somewhat dumbly, to use an adjustable semaphore to not be too eager in its preloading of values.  It will load between 2 and 20 values simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIt's in code review 887."
