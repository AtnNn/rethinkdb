      "Thanks for the information @behrad.\r\n\r\nMore than 5 seconds for fetching 10 documents using an index is indeed really really really slow. Especially since your data set should fit into the cache.\r\n\r\nWe'll try to mirror your configuration on our side and see if we can reproduce the problem. Thanks for your report and the details on your workload.\r\nI'm not sure if there's much you can do about it at the moment, since this looks like a problem in RethinkDB itself. It's definitely not the performance I would expect.\r\n\r\nWhich version of RethinkDB are you using?"
