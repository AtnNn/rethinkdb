      "At first I was thinking if `.update( {id: UUID, param: r.get('param').default([]).append([\"myvalue\"]) }` is an expensive operation for rethink, since I don't know how it handles the updates. \r\n\r\nMy best bet is to update in place, or incrementally update the same doc with the results. However if this is a bad idea, I also could write each result in a new doc, relating them to the original doc. Don't know if the join query would perform any better!?\r\n\r\nYou may give me valuable comments on my data arch. @danielmewes "
