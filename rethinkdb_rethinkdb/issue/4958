        "We currently use a watchdog service to monitor our rethink cluster to ensure that a maximum desired replica count is reached if at all possible.  Generally this means that if want e.g. 5 maximum replicas, we have to watch the `server_status` table, and conditionally reconfigure the relevant tables to `r.expr([ serverCount, 5]).min()` - because if you try to just reconfigure to 5 without 5 available servers you'll receive an error.  It would be really great if the parameters passed to `reconfigure` were a desired maximum for shards and replicas (or perhaps an \"acceptable range\"?)."
