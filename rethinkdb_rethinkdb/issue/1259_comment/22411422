      "It's really `order_by` that's inconsistent here because for numerous reasons you can't use pattern matching in it. `groupby` was designed to be consistent with `pluck` and friends. Basically I think `pluck` is a shorter but less powerful version of `map` while `groupby` is a shorter but less powerful version of `gmr`. We're planning to eventually have aggregators in `gmr` at which point if we add functions to `groupby` they'll actually be the same function.\r\n\r\nI actually think we made the right decision in the design of this function because it's simple and mimics SQL's `group_by` and users always have `gmr` to do more complicated things. I'd also really prefer not to knock this back in to the discussion phases the day before release."
