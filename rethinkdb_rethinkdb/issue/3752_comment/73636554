      "I would consider a different syntax for this.\r\n\r\nWhat if instead of using the `--port-offset` argument, we allowed the port in `HOST:PORT` to start with a `+` or `-`? So I could write `rethinkdb import -c localhost:+2` to have port offset 2.\r\n\r\nThis is nice because we could support the same syntax for `--join` / `-j` on the server."
