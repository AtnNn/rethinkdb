      "The table file is already corrupted, and it is difficult or even impossible to trace how it got to that state from looking at the crash and the file.\r\n\r\nMy best bet right now is to a) read all the involved code again and b) try to replicate as much of the table configuration as possible and leave a server running over a long time with additional checks enabled, hoping that that will trigger the issue.\r\n\r\nI don't know if that is actually relevant, but had you run previous versions of RethinkDB (e.g. 1.12.3) on the same data directory @colprog? Or did you start from scratch after installing 1.12.4?"
