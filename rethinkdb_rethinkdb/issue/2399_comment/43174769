      "Thank you for the report @colprog. Sorry you are experiencing this problem.\r\nAlso thank you @chrisvariety for cleaning up the backtrace!\r\n\r\nThe error message is typical for problems related to snapshotting in our cache, and we have seen and fixed a couple of issues before that resulted in similar crashes.\r\nApparently there still is some problem left.\r\n(this is not to say that it definitely has to be related to snapshotting, but it seems likely speaking from my past experience)\r\n\r\n@colprog Can you tell us a bit more about your cluster configuration, data and workload?\r\nSpecifically:\r\n- How many nodes are in the cluster?\r\n- How many tables do you have?\r\n- What are the approximate sizes of the documents stored in those tables? How many documents are there?\r\n- Do you have any secondary indexes?\r\n- Are the tables replicated and/or sharded?\r\n- What types of queries do you run against the database? Are there writes going on? Do you use any complex range queries, such as `r.table().map()`, `r.table().filter()` or `r.table().group()`?\r\n\r\nI know it takes some time to answer all of these questions, and I really appreciate your help. I'm asking them because I would like to replicate your setup and workload as closely as possible in order to reproduce the bug."
