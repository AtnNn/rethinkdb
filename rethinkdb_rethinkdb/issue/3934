        "It's similar to what was mentioned in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2979 but my use case is a bit different. I'm trying to have the connection pool in rethinkdbdash automatically populates connections to all the servers listed in the table `server_status`.\r\n\r\nAnd one problem that surfaces is that people may try to populate the pool from `localhost`. I have one pool per server (and a \"master\" that manage all these pools). Since `localhost` will match all the servers, I can't know exactly in which pool I should put these connections.\r\n\r\nI'm working around this by opening new connection to not localhost (by picking up the \"wider\" address and closing the one to localhost, but being able to run `r.whoami()` and get a server id would make the code way more simple.\r\nIf the server id can be returned at the end of the handshake, that would also work for me.\r\n"
