        "The docs, overall, are pretty good to excellent I would say.  In particular, this page: http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/sql-to-reql/ is very very useful.\r\n\r\nAn area for improvement would be to include examples when only working with a single document.  Most of the examples assume a collection and working with .map.  It wasn't clear to me to use .do when working with a single document.  Some examples for single docs, I think, would save others a lot of time.  Thanks!"
