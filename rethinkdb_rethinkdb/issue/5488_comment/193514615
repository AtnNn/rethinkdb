      "thumbs up for everything related to easier and more convenient date/time functions. Past few months I've written 30+ queries that do some variation of r.now() to epochTime, do some math on that and use what comes to create a proper date time for the actual query. ReQL being so nice, it's not THAT bad of a task, but feel's like there might be a proper opportunity for improvements."
