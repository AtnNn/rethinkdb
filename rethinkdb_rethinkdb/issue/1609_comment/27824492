      "I fear that everything we can do with respect to priorities might not have the desired effects when it comes to write queries.\r\nI haven't actually looked at the implementation of delete, but I could imagine that this is actually a locking issue. It seems that yielding the locks within a delete might be difficult. I'll have to think about that a bit more.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner: Do you have something specific in mind?\r\n\r\n@wojons: What size is your database? Do you know if it fits in the cache or if there is disk i/o involved?"
