        "I added a new user to my database and for some reason I got `Wrong password` error. I looked at the repo and I saw this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n@rawSocket.user = host[\"user\"]\r\n@rawSocket.password = host[\"password\"]\r\n\r\n# Default to admin user with no password if none is given.\r\nif @rawSocket.user is undefined\r\n    @rawSocket.user = \"admin\"\r\nif @rawSocket.password is undefined\r\n    @rawSocket.password = \"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything is fine here but when I looked over the compiled version in my node_modules folder I saw this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n_this.rawSocket.username = host[\"username\"];\r\n_this.rawSocket.password = host[\"password\"];\r\nif (_this.rawSocket.username === void 0) {\r\n  _this.rawSocket.username = \"admin\";\r\n}\r\nif (_this.rawSocket.password === void 0) {\r\n  _this.rawSocket.password = \"\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I had to set `username` on the `connect` method not `user` to have this working. The npm package version is 2.3.0."
