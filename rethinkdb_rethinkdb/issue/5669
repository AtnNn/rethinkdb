        "I added a new user to my database and for some reason I got `Wrong password` error. I looked at the repo and I saw this:\n\n``` javascript\n@rawSocket.user = host[\"user\"]\n@rawSocket.password = host[\"password\"]\n\n# Default to admin user with no password if none is given.\nif @rawSocket.user is undefined\n    @rawSocket.user = \"admin\"\nif @rawSocket.password is undefined\n    @rawSocket.password = \"\"\n```\n\nEverything is fine here but when I looked over the compiled version in my node_modules folder I saw this:\n\n``` javascript\n_this.rawSocket.username = host[\"username\"];\n_this.rawSocket.password = host[\"password\"];\nif (_this.rawSocket.username === void 0) {\n  _this.rawSocket.username = \"admin\";\n}\nif (_this.rawSocket.password === void 0) {\n  _this.rawSocket.password = \"\";\n}\n```\n\nSo I had to set `username` on the `connect` method not `user` to have this working. The npm package version is 2.3.0.\n"
