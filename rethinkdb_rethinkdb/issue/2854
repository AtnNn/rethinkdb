        "`getIntersecting()` and `getNearest()` should be as lazy as is possible with reasonable effort.\r\n\r\nThis is easier to do for `getNearest()` than for `getIntersecting()`.\r\nIn both cases we should try to push down chained filters and maps to the individual shards, even if we end up not actually making these terms lazy."
