        "The current tests for the http ReQL code all use `http://httpbin.org` as the target for their downloads. This is sub-optimal both because it means that this can never be checked without a network connection, and because it makes us dependent on an external service.\r\n\r\n`httpbin` is open source, and so we could include it in our project and run it for the tests. Or we could code up our own equivalents without too much trouble."
