      "Okay, here are some problems.\r\n\r\n1. We try to interrupt a process but then crash if it didn't exist.  The process is dying so quickly that the interrupt test is failing, and the interrupt code is wrongly complaining that the process is dead.  Now maybe our existing processes are never supposed to die on their own.  But the unit test processes do die, as a normal course of events.\r\n\r\n2. When we interrupt a job, some other socket stuff fails because we can't write to or read from the socket, and that's causing us to crash in other places."
