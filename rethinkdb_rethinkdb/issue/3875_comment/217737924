      "I had the same confusion as @tve from reading those docs. The quoted sentence immediately follows the options documentation, so it seemed like it was talking about the `primaryKey` option, not the value put in to a primary key field later.\r\n\r\nI'm extremely new to RethinkDB, but I stumbled across this issue because I'd like to create a junction table for a many-to-many relationship and was hoping to have a unique constraint on the pair of both IDs, plus only two indexes (leftId, rightId), rather than three (primaryKey, leftId, rightId)."
