      "@deontologician Well we need to add support for some sort of primary key transformation first. Currently the primary key is always the value of an actual field, and some parts of our code make use of this property.\r\n\r\nSo we would need to support some sort of primary key function.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest that we limit the set of functions one can use though, to avoid upgrading issues if some ReQL term changes (you can rebuild secondary indexes pretty easily without downtime, but you cannot just rebuild the primary index)."
