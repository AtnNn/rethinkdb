      "@tve The difference is that the documentation talks about storing an array in the single primary key field, while this issue is about supporting a primary key that combines data from multiple fields.\r\n\r\nIf you store arrays in the primary key field, the primary index will indeed behave somewhat like a compound index when querying.\r\n\r\nI think the wording in the documentation is a bit misleading here. I'll open a separate issue in our docs repository tracker. Thanks for pointing it out."
