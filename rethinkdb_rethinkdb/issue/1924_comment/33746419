      "If we could somehow make it so that we only build with versions of the STL that support rvalue references, that would be nice.  (I find myself worrying right now that I'm writing code that will run super slow on 4.4, and I often choose not to use rvalue references because of that worry.)  I'm not sure how worth it that is though.  (@srh, do you have an opinion?)"
