      "Ok, I talked to @mlucy and we decided to leave the semantics of `group` as they are in next right now.\r\n\r\n@wojons -- I realize this is an inconvenience, and I'm really sorry about that. But we agreed that having a clean, well designed API is more important than maintaining a worse legacy version.\r\n\r\nWe'll help you migrate with clear migration instructions, and if you still run into problems, we'll write some wrapper functions for you that you can call to make the problem less pressing.\r\n\r\nClosing."
