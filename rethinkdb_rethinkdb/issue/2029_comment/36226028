      "@wojons -- again I understand. Just to give a little more idea on the tradeoffs here:\r\n\r\n* The new implementation is much cleaner, but required a huge refactor so we can't use old code.\r\n* We could add `group_by` support back, but it would be a lot of work, and would like have bugs we wouldn't otherwise have that we'll have to uncover and fix.\r\n* Alternatively we could work on making the server more stable, and pour the resources in other areas.\r\n\r\nSo the tradeoff is that we have no choice but to inconvenience you. We'll either do it by slowing down development (to do backwards compatibility), or by breaking compatibility. We chose the former because we decided it's the lesser of the two evils. It will inconvenience our users in the short term, but will bring them the most bang for the bug in the long term.\r\n\r\nSo again -- sorry for the short-term frustration."
