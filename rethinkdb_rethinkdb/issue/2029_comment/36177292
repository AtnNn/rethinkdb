      "So, just to clarify, the reason we use an array now rather than duplicating `pluck` is that the new `group` is more powerful.  The old `groupby` could only group by fields, but the new `group` can also group by indexes or arbitrary functions.  So you could write:\r\n```ruby\r\ntable.group('a', lambda {|row| row['b'] + row['c']}, index:'d')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the format of your groups would be `[A, B+C, INDEX_D]`."
