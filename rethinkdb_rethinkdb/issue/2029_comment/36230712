      "@coffeemug its not a big inconveniences just one i was not expecting. I am not sure if anyone else is using rethink-db with the syntax but they are going to have to make the changes i keep upto date with the development so I am able to be ready for these changes a head of time. I am mostly speeking for the people that are unaware that this is going to be changed and will want 1.12 but may have to make some code changes before hand."
