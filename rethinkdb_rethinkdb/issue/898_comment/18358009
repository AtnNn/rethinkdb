      "Ok, this is kind of a PHP problem. In PHP you cannot distinguish ['0' => 'a'] from ['a'], so the driver assumes that you intend to have an array instead of an object datum.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that the PHP driver sends an array that contains a string. Probably the server assumes that the insert is a batched insert when it sees the array? However the array does not contain an object, but just a string datum. This seems to be what is triggering the crash.\r\n\r\nWhen I send the server just a string without wrapping it into an array, the error handling on the server side works as expected. "
