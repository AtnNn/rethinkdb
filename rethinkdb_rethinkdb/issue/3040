        "When the server is starting up all of the `info:` lines are currently going to STDERR rather than STDOUT. In normal operation we don't have anything on STDOUT at all. I talked to @gchpaco and @mlucy about this, and we are in agreement about the following:\r\n\r\n1. The `info` lines should be printed to STDOUT. `warn` and above should stay on STDERR.\r\n2. At least for STDOUT we can probably drop the `info:` text. The `log_file` should keep the designation.\r\n3. The current `info` level should probably be split into `info` and `notice` levels (consistent with syslog) with things like semilattice change and cluster connection messages remaining in the lower `info` level while important notices like the connection ports getting bumped to `notice`.\r\n4. `info` level messages should not (by default) go to STDOUT. They should still be in the `log_file`, and if desired we can add a `--verbose` flag to output these. `notice` would go out on STDOUT.\r\n\r\nThe goal would be to have a normal server startup output nothing to STDERR (because there were no errors/warnings)."
