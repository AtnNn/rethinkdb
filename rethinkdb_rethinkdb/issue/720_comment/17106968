      "In the json format (the target of the yaml compilation process and the format actually interpreted by the website) the return type is per-command, not per-language. Fixing this to allow JS to override the return type will require modifying the both the website and the webui and then modifying the script that converts from yaml to json.\r\n\r\nOnce that's done though, changing the source to override the return value for just JS will be simple."
