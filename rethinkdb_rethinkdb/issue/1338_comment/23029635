      "@fare5 you probably shouldn't use Rethinkdb 1.3.2, it's quite an old version (we just released 1.8 last week).\r\n\r\nYou should take a look at https://github.com/njlg/gentoo-overlay/blob/master/dev-db/rethinkdb/rethinkdb-1.8.0.ebuild\r\nNote to @atnnn: I think we don't depend on jre and ruby_protobuf right? We can send him a pull request if it's the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n@fare5, I'm an Arch user, and don't have a VM with Gentoo right now, @atnnn is a Gentoo user, so he will probably be able to help you more."
