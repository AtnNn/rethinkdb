        "I have no indication that this is actually slowing us down, but at the same time it's a trivial optimization to make the use of `guarantee` (presumably) a lot cheaper.\n\nRelying on the CPU's dynamic branch prediction table is not an excuse, since that has a very limited size.\nAlso someone here http://stackoverflow.com/a/3702965/2413884 notes that typically compilers assume that every `if` is taken if they don't have any better information. The way our guarantee is written, this is bad because the `if` is practically never taken.\n\nIn GCC there is `__builtin_expect` for this https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html\n"
