      "We haven't discussed an interface in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1771 yet, but we should probably expose the memory vs disk table option as an opt arg to `table_create`. Similarly it should show up in `r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_config')`.\r\n(Ping @mlucy and @timmaxw.)\r\n\r\nI wonder how this interacts with the current way we manage secondary indexes on replicated/sharded tables. From what I can tell if you restart a server with memory tables like these, those replicas will have empty tables without any secondary indexes (since the indexes are stored in the table itself). We might want to wait for Raft where @timmaxw has changed that before including this.\r\n\r\n@wojons I'm curious, have you done any benchmarks with this? I wonder how much faster this is compared to a normal table that's completely in cache."
