      "Revisiting this, I think it might be better to make the cache never evict any current pages, and have the serializer just be a \"black hole\" serializer that throws away all writes and crashes if you try to read from it.\r\nWith the in-memory serializer, there's the problem of keeping the same data in memory twice, once in the serializer and once in the cache. (*Edit:* Oh just realized that's exactly what @timmaxw said :) )"
