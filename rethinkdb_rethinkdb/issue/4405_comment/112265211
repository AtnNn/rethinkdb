      "Turns out the test was using noreply writes, which are no longer guaranteed to be executed in order.\r\n\r\n@larkost @VeXocide mentioned that you had recently added the noreply to speed up the test. Unfortunately it doesn't work in this case, since the test assumes that the updates are performed in order. I added soft durability instead, but the test is still taking about 4 minutes on newton.\r\nIn general this test is really old (from 2010) and comes from a time where appending to a value was actually using a different code path than other modifications. We should strongly consider trimming it down to fewer appends or even removing it altogether. The only thing I'd like to make sure is that we have at least some test that tests writing large documents."
