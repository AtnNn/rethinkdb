      "We would have to link to it statically when building the ubuntu packages, which is easy to do but is annoying for users.\r\n\r\nHow much work would it take to adapt the rethinkdb server to the interface changes?\r\n\r\nCan the javascript and ruby drivers work with 1.5.0? \r\n\r\nFor the upcoming `rethinkdb export` (#193), we need to distribute the python driver along with rethinkdb,  which means we need to depend on native packages and not on pip packages."
