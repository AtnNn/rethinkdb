      "There are multiple serializer threads, aren't there?  Also, the problem already exists, should the balancer try to give most of the cache's memory to tables that reside on a certain node.  We also already have this problem with read-ahead buffers.  Addressing this question is not limited to deciding which thread buffers should be allocated on.\r\n\r\nAnd if we do want to worry about memory usage, the first thing to worry about is whether we should switch to jemalloc.  Based on internet posts that might be out of date, it seems like we should."
