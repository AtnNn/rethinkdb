      "You don't need one of the caches of a single table, you can just have all 8 of the caches get memory assigned by the cache balancer.  They're probably all going to be on the same CPU.\r\n\r\n> @srh: Is jemalloc supposed to use less memory in general?\r\n\r\nYes, that's the difference.  That info could be out of date.  jemalloc's downside, relative to tcmalloc, is supposedly the performance you see when spawning threads on the fly, which we do not do.\r\n\r\n"
