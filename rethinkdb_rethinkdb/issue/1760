        "Running 4 node cluster on a single box (16 core 256GB RAM) using version 1.11.2 of rethinkdb. Table with 4 shards and no replication, 2 secondary indexes, with an 8192MB cache. The 4 shards already existed but were very unbalanced. The table had about 95M docs and was about 500GB on disk (from du on data directories). Each instance of rethinkdb was using between 10GB and 20GB of RAM before I tried to rebalance the table. Rebalancing ran for about 6 or 8 hours before I ran out of memory and one of the instances was killed. The three remaining instances were using about 70GB of RAM each.\r\n\r\nThis is a lot more than I would expect to happen from doing a rebalance - is something wrong or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nideally this would be doable without using so much RAM, and even if all available memory gets used i should get a warning about it."
