      "I think it would be best for the official Python driver to ship without protobuf dependencies. So I'd do a separate driver just for testing protobuf connections. One really simple way of doing it is to fork the latest stable version of the Python driver for this test, or write a simple new one that connects to the server and does something really simple (like `r.expr(1).add(1)`). Writing a driver like this would actually be a neat exercise (if you haven't learned how the current ones work already)."
