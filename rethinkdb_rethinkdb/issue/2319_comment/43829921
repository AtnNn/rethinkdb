      "After a conversation with @AtnNn I think that the best solution here is to write a new, very incomplete, driver in C/C++. The reasoning is to not have any dependencies other than what we already have. Since the Protobuf support is going out of Python (and Ruby) I would rather move to where we already have a need for its support: C++ for the server.\r\n\r\nCreating a simple C++ test that natively speaks the correct Protobuf language for only a couple of queries should be relatively easy, and seems to meet the requirements."
