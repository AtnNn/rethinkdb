      "@mglukhovsky, you're looking at the wrong errors, those appear to be a side-effect of the crash - you have to look at the first error (which here is a segmentation fault, and in #3041 is a failed guarantee in the serializer).\r\n\r\n@paramaggarwal, it is very unlikely that 3def008 fixes the problem, as that bug appeared after some changes that have not been released yet.  In addition, that is a crash in the worker process and this is a crash in the main process, with very different stack traces.  I'll look into it as soon as I get into the office."
