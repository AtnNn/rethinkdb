        "I think I found a bug in the Web admin interface. It emits TypeError after removing an unreachable server while having some unsatisfiable goals related to datacenter. I'm using 1.12.5.\n\nSteps to produce:\n1. Create two servers, and join them to a cluster.\n2. Create a datacenter, and assign one of the servers to the newly created datacenter.\n3. Create a table, and set replicas to 1 in the multi datacenter options. Now, the server belonging to the datacenter is set to the secondary, and the server that doesn't belong to the datacenter takes the primary role.\n4. Kill the server that doesn't belong to the datacenter. When an issue arises, remove the server from the cluster.\n5. Another issue arises, named unsatisfiable goals, as we cannot elect a new primary server for the table, because the datacenter replica constraint requires one more replica server.\n6. From now, whenever the user clicks a link to the table details, a JavaScript exception which will be described later is raised. Because of the exception, the table details page cannot be displayed, which blocks the user from adjusting the replica settings solely using the Web interface.\n7. After running \"set replicas [table] 0 [datacenter]\" in the command line admin interface, the issue is resolved, and the JS exception is also gone.\n\n```\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'get' of undefined\n@ cluster-min.js?v=1.12.5:4896\n```\n\n``` javascript\nfor (machine_id in _ref) {\n        peer_roles = _ref[machine_id];\n        data_on_machines[machine_id] = {\n          name: machines.get(machine_id).get('name'),\n```\n"
