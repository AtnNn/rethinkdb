        "`test_runner` started failing recently on MacOS when run because it was hitting the open files rlimt (defaults to 256 on MacOS). While I have not nailed it down yet the current theory is that something is preventing garbage collection to kick in so we build up a lot of open temp files. However, the priority at the moment is 2.0, so I have papered over this issue with code to raise the limit to at least 512 open files which bypasses the problem. This went in to `next` (a1c9beb) and `v2.0.x` (51fdc03).\r\n\r\nThis issue is to remind me to find the root cause of this at some later date."
