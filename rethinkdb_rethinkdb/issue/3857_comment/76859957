      "I like it, the functionality is nice and clean. The buttons only showing up on hover is probably not the way to go though. We don't use that mechanism anywhere else in the ui. @mglukhovsky also mentioned we try to remove as much as we can from the table listing to keep it uncluttered.\r\n\r\nWhat I think needs to happen:\r\n\r\n1.  move the \"Explore\" button to the top of the table page (next to \", and leave it off the table listing page for now. We have an issue open for redesigning the table listing page in the medium-near future (#3825), so we'll probably revisit whether we can make it work at that point.\r\n2. Instead of setting location.hash directly, use the backbone router like: ```main_view.router.navigate(\"#dataexplorer\")```"
