        "The first big part of the windows port concerns mostly compatibility with Visual C++ and building the dependencies. It is in the `atnnn/windows2` branch. The `windows` branch contains the rest of the code of the Windows port, but it is a little messier.\n- Instructions for building dependencies\n- Use `#ifdef _WIN32` to check for Windows\n- Use `#ifdef _MSC_VER` to check for Visual C++\n- Add a Windows implementation of some small functions\n- Stub out larger blocks of code that aren't compatible with Windows\n- Modify the code to build with Visual C++\n  - See for example \"Nonstandard Behaviour\" https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x84h5b78.aspx\n"
