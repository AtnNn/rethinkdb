      "@thatsVishal If you start `rethinkdb` on the command line and don't pass it any `-d` parameter to specify a different data directory, it creates a data directory called `rethinkdb_data` in the current path.\r\n\r\nWhat you describe sounds consistent with starting RethinkDB in a different directory afterwards. Search your file system for `rethinkdb_data`, and you will probably find the old data files. Then you can pass the correct data path to `rethinkdb` through the `-d` parameter and your data should be accessible again."
