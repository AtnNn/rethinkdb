      "We currently have nothing in the template or the view doing any kind of\r\nrounding. I don't see any helpers in utils.coffee for rounding, though I'm\r\nsure I've seen the \"9M\" behavior before. Will have to investigate in git to\r\nsee what it used to do\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Feb 3, 2015 at 3:34 PM, Daniel Mewes <notifications@github.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure.
