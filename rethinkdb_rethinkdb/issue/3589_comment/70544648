      "@Ellyster thank you for your explanation.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that once a server has joined a cluster, it always technically has full access to the cluster configuration. In addition, every user can delete tables and databases through ReQL, even without access to the administration tools.\r\nPlease also note that all administration tasks will be performable directly through ReQL queries starting with the upcoming release (1.16). So everyone who runs queries can also change the cluster configuration, unless you implement additional filtering through some sort of ReQL proxy on your side."
