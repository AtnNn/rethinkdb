      "Thank you for the suggestion @Ellyster .\r\nWe're planning to make setting up SSL/TLS and/or other tunnels much easier in the future.\r\nSee https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3151 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3158\r\n\r\nI'm not sure yet whether this is going to include the web administration UI, but we'll consider it. The suggested approaches in the other threads would be based on a private/public key authentication scheme though, not 2-factor authentication. Would that work for you?"
