      "Maybe it is easier if I explain our situation.\r\n\r\nWe are working in an application to build collaborative repository of open access research literature, and thus we need to allow each university to deploy a RethinkDB node in their own servers and join to the cluster network.\r\n\r\nSo they will have direct access to the each hosting server (it makes network-based security useless), but they shouldn't be allowed to access the db management tools (even if they have local access to the server).\r\n\r\nSo as long as there is a way to disallow a new node to join the cluster if it hasn't the right security configuration (only our admin keys) for the management panel a Private/public key authentication scheme will work for me too."
