      "@srh: For you information: I've briefly tried to reproduce this on sinister and couldn't. I also had to install a newer version of Ruby first (at least 1.9.3) through RVM ( http://blog.coolaj86.com/articles/installing-ruby-on-ubuntu-12-04.html and https://rvm.io/rvm/basics ) to run the tests.\r\nHad the test running for about an hour. This was on an ext4 file system.\r\nI recommend you set up a VM with Btrfs to potentially get a better chance at reproducing this (and for avoiding having to deal with outdated Ruby packages)."
