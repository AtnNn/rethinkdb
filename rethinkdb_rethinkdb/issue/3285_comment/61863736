      "I've looked at the code of btrfs, and they use `EEXIST` extensively.\r\nWhen write() are performed, some data gets into some tree, which can fail https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/btrfs/extent_map.c#L109\r\nSometimes, it's just due to racy behavior: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/btrfs/delayed-inode.c#L155\r\n\r\nI don't know, it seems like btrfs is buggy and rethinkdb is just fine."
