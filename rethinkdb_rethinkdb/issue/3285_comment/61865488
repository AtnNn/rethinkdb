      "This and other issues we've had in the past with Btrfs makes me wonder if we should print a warning to the log if we detect that RethinkDB is running on Btrfs.\r\nI suspect that this issue can be avoided by running RethinkDB with the `--no-direct-io` flag, so we could suggest that as a work around in the warning message.\r\n`--no-direct-io` stops RethinkDB from using direct i/o and instead makes it go through the slower but typically much better tested buffered i/o pathway of the operating system."
