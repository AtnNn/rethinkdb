      "Thanks for the report and core file @nviennot .\r\n* Which file system and OS version is this on?\r\n* Were there other write operations going on either in parallel or in quick succession with the `table_create()`? Maybe even other metadata operations (e.g. `table_drop()`, other `table_create()` etc.)?\r\n* How frequently does this happen (say once every 10 table creates or once every 10,000)?\r\n* Was this with NoBrainer? NoBrainer does automatic table creation right?\r\n\r\n@srh can you take a look at this please?"
