        "From a user on Stack Overflow:\r\n\r\n> Suppose I've connected to a RethinkDB server's web UI and I'd like to find out what version is running under the hood. Is there a way (in the Data Explorer?) to query for the version number, e.g. 1.13.3?\r\n\r\nIt seems like a good idea to add `r.version()`, which would return the server version number (particularly as we're moving towards seamless migrations.)"
