      "Hello @timjrobinson, I would have a few more questions:\r\n\r\nWhat is the `Handshake timedout` error that you get? The one from the driver, or the one in your code?\r\nIf it's the one from your code, what's logged before the error \"Handshake timedout\"?\r\n\r\nOne line 11, you throw the error, and therefore never call the callback on line 12, if you wrap the call `db.onConnect` with a timer, that may explain the problem?\r\n\r\nI just tried to run an http server that's opening connection with `db.onConnect`, and I couldn't reproduce any error."
