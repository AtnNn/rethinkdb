      "@timjrobinson The reads/sec count the number of documents that are being read from the table. The `filter` in your query reads the whole table to check the filter condition, so the spike in reads that you are seeing is expected. If you want to optimize the query, you could add an index on `expires` and use a `between` query with the index."
