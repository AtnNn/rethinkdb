      "The Handshake timedout error is coming from rethinkdb. It's what err.message is set to. I only added that throw to make the server crash so I could diagnose the issue, it's not in there normally. \r\n\r\nI added some code to try and reconnect when a timeout is encountered and then looked at the logs and it seems that every few minutes connections start timing out for 10 - 30 seconds then return to normal and work fine for a few minutes. \r\n\r\nI'll try and reproduce the error in a small test case rather than in my app and see how I go. I still haven't figured it out and it appears to be completely random when the timeouts start occuring. "
