      "@coffeemug no\r\n\r\nThe \"Handshake timedout\" (shouldn't that be \"Handshake timed out\"?) message is emitted by the JavaScript driver when it does not receive a response from the server fast enough. In this case after 20 seconds.\r\n\r\n@timjrobinson The next time this happens, could you run `netstat -t -p -a` and send me the output (daniel@rethinkdb.com)? Since you are working locally on the machine, you probably would have noticed if it was running out of memory and going into swap. Still it could be worth checking `free -m` when this ocurrs to see whether the RethinkDB server might be swapped out of RAM."
