        "I've got a cluster of rethinkdb boxes running in gcloud on ubuntu 14.04 virtual machines.\n\n`\"version\":  \"rethinkdb 2.3.4~0trusty (GCC 4.8.2)\"`\n\nTalking to this cluster I have a kubernetes cluster, which is running  a number of rethinkdb proxy nodes, hidden behind a load balancer.\n\nMost of the time, the requests work fine, but I see quite often errors such as these:\n\n```\nError: ReqlOpFailedError: Cannot perform read: lost contact with primary replica in:\n```\n\nand:\n\n```\nError: ReqlOpFailedError: Cannot perform read: primary replica for shard [\"\", \"S2\\x84\\x912\") not available in:\n```\n\nI\8217ve thought it\8217s a race condition, where we\8217re doing a write and a non-outdated read at the same time, but I\8217m unsure if this is a likely scenario. \n\nI feel that bad network conditions are unlikely, due to the frequency which we see these errors, and it\8217s all inter-network communication.\n\nweb console looks fine, as does the `r.db('rethinkdb').table('server_status')` query.\n\nAny assistance debugging this issue would be greatly appreciated!\n"
