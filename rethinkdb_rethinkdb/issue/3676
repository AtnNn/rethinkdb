        "In solving other problems I discovered that a lot of the polyglot tests have are only defined for one language. In a few cases this is correct, since that particular syntax is only exposed in some of the drivers/languages, but in the majority of cases it is just missing.\n\nThe best way of doing this is probably to create a script that uses the parsers from `test-runner` to go through all of the scripts and point out places where we do not have coverage for all languages, and then manually go through that list.\n"
