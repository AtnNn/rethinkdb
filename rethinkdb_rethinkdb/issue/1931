        "GCC >= 4.5 supports link-time optimizations.\r\n\r\nI tried it with GCC 4.6.3 and got the following results:\r\n- Link time increases by 2-3 minutes. LTO should probably be enabled through a configure option which we can use for benchmarking and official packages, but not during regular development.\r\n- Read throughput on YCSB increases by 7-10%.\r\n\r\nTo enable the optimization, we have to add the \"-flto\" flag to RT_CXXFLAGS and \"-flto -O3\" to RT_LDFLAGS. Currently there is a problem with 'arch/runtime/context_switching.cc' due to the use of symbols declared in inline assembly (namely `_lightweight_swapcontext`). @atnnn told me how I could make `make` not pass \"-flto\" when compiling 'context_switching.cc', and that worked.\r\n\r\nCLANG has a similar option (see http://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html) but I haven't tried it.\r\n\r\nI think we should enable link-time optimizations for building our official binaries on platforms that support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetailed performance results (YCSB workload \"c\", pure reads. Single node on magneto):\r\n```\r\nPlain:\r\n     10 clients: [OVERALL], Throughput(ops/sec), 18500.703026715015\r\n     32 clients: [OVERALL], Throughput(ops/sec), 37647.767487387995\r\n    256 clients: [OVERALL], Throughput(ops/sec), 41085.38088585751\r\n\r\n-flto:\r\n     10 clients: [OVERALL], Throughput(ops/sec), 20308.692120227457\r\n     32 clients: [OVERALL], Throughput(ops/sec), 40719.92833292613\r\n    256 clients: [OVERALL], Throughput(ops/sec), 45005.671077504725\r\n\r\n-flto -fwhole-program:\r\n     10 clients: [OVERALL], Throughput(ops/sec), 20537.25457980777\r\n     32 clients: [OVERALL], Throughput(ops/sec), 40051.26561999359\r\n    256 clients: [OVERALL], Throughput(ops/sec), 45311.582381729204\r\n```"
