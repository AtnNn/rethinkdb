      "> This is how it already works today though:\r\n\r\nSorry, what I said was unclear. Right now there is no inconsistency between that and how `add` reacts to other types, since types other than arrays are not accepted in the first place. However if we made `add` accept arguments other than arrays to handle them as single items, it would become inconsistent with how it handles arrays."
