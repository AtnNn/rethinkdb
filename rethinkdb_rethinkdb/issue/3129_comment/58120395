      "Ok, I see what you're saying. I was expecting `add` to work the same was as [`concat` in JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) which has the \"inconsistent\" behavior you described. Looking at other language implementations of `Array.concat()`, it does appear that JS is the oddball."
