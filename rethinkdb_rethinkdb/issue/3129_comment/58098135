      "Having `add` accept a single element is problematic.\r\nIt would work fine if you have an array of strings, numbers or objects.\r\nHowever it will break down if you are building an array of arrays (e.g. `[ [a, b], [b, c] ]`). Running `.add([d, e])` on that will result in `[ [a, b], [b, c], d, e ]` which would be inconsistent with the behavior of adding types other than arrays to an array.\r\n\r\nDoes using `append` instead work for you @marshall007 ?"
