        "Using the javascript driver I found that `run` method in some cases thrown Errors, for example if the connection is not connected.\r\n\r\nBecause the function is asynchronous, I think that any error has to be reported to the callback or rejecting the promise, than throwing them synchronously.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I don't wrap between try catch block asynchronous functions so an error on it, should be reported by node, but in our case it wasn't bubbling and it was difficult detect our issue which drove `run` to throw the Errors.\r\n\r\nThere are three cases where the Errors are throw in `run`:\r\n* [76](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/ast.coffee#L76)\r\n* [93](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/ast.coffee#L93)\r\n* [95](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/ast.coffee#L95)\r\n\r\nIn our case they came from [95](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/ast.coffee#L95)"
