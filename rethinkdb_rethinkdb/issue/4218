        "Discussed with @AtnNn on IRC. I'm trying to delete ~8k documents using `.getAll()` on a secondary index. The table has ~19k total docs. I've tried to run the following query several times (for at most 5m), but I've yet to see it run to completion:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar terms = r.http('https://example.com/data.json')('term');\r\n\r\nr.db(...).table('terms')\r\n  .getAll(r.args(terms), { index: 'term' })\r\n  .delete()\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplacing `.delete()` with `.count()` finishes in ~7.5s. Based on our discussion and the things I've tried, I don't think it has anything to do with `r.http`, but rather is simply `.getAll()` being less efficient with a large number of keys. Also, as suggested by @AtnNn, this works:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.http('https://example.com/data.json')('term')\r\n.forEach(function (row) {\r\n  return r.table('terms')\r\n    .getAll(row, { index: 'term' })\r\n    .delete()\r\n  })\r\n```"
