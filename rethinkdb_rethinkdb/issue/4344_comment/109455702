      "It would be easy to publish alpha version of the drivers.\r\n\r\nHowever we would first have to keep a seperate branch fo driver specific changes, and changes secific to the next version of RethinkDB, otherwise alpha versions of the driver would not be compatible with any released version of RethinkDB. #1740 would also be a great idea."
