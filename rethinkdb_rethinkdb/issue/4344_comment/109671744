      "If you guys do move the javascript driver out of this repository then you don't even need to publish alpha versions on NPM, everyone can just `npm install git+ssh://git@github.com/rethinkdb/node-rethinkdb#alpha`, or whatever other version tag or branch :)\r\n\r\nReleasing alpha versions of drivers or publishing the javascript driver in a separate repository are both fine options to let other people install nightly/alpha versions of modules, choose the easiest one for you :) I myself am a fan of #1740."
