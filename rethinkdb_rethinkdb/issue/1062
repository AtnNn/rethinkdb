        "I really do not have any confidence in our OS X build from a performance perspective, and I'm mildly skeptical of it from a stability perspective as well.  For those who've been following the mailing list, Drew's issues add some urgency to this problem.  We need to put a big warning label somewhere saying that the OS X build is for evaluation and testing purposes and is not meant to be run in production.\n\nIf and when we finally manage to get OS X integrated with our testing system, we can go back and remove that notice, but right now I think it's really bad that we don't give people any warning before they waste hours of their life playing around it.\n"
