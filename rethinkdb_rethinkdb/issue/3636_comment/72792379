      "I would just do it in JS since that's what the web UI uses.  (Or, alternatively, some sort of pseudocode.)  It obviously isn't perfect, but it's strictly less work than adding server-side pretty printing for third-party drivers + a pseudotype + support for that pseudotype in the official drivers.  (That said, it isn't *that* much work to have all those things.)"
