      "I would be OK with this.  The pseudotype should probably contain the ReQL version as well as the JSON representation.\r\n\r\nOne question is third-party clients: a lot of them don't have pretty-printing (and it's a lot of work to add), but we'd still like to let users of those clients use the jobs table.  An option that's more work for us is to have a runtime option drivers can provide to indicate whether or not they'd like `REQL_QUERY` pseudotypes to contain a pre-pretty-printed source representation (probably in JS since that's what the web UI uses).  The default would be to send the pretty-printed code as part of the pseudotype, so that users of third-party drivers which haven't been updated can see what they need to see, and our official drivers (plus any third party drivers that are smart enough) would opt out of the pre-pretty-printing and pretty-print themselves."
