      "I think in the long term the pseudo-type solution is strictly better. It will also make things like exporting secondary index functions much nicer, and allow us to add `r.eval` and related features.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely fine to skip the pseudo type for now and only do the JavaScript pretty-printer on the server. Since we need the pretty printer anyway, we will be able to still use it once we introduce the pseudo-type."
