      "I kinda want to get the pseudo type in to 2.0 for driver developers even if we don't do anything with it (i.e. just print the server generated string).\r\n\r\nAs to pretty printing, there's some interesting divergences on what people actually *mean* by pretty printing, but what I mean is well supported by one of [Oleg Kiselyov's papers](http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/PPYield/yield-pp.pdf).  Oppen's original optimal algorithm is imperative (which we don't care about) and uses coroutines (which is a bit awkward in many driver languages); Kiselyov's modification uses generators which are easy to retrofit even into C++, and it's performant, and it generates understandable results.\r\n\r\nI tend to be pretty firm about needing to do something like this because I personally cannot read code easily without newline breaks.\r\n\r\nI'm working on prototyping it now."
