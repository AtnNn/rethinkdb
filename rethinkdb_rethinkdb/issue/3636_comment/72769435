      "Once this is implemented, would it be possible to retrieve the function definition of a secondary index as `REQL_QUERY`? Also will I be able to do `query.coerceTo('REQL_QUERY')`?\r\n\r\nIt would be really awesome if we could compare existing secondary indices to what we expect them to be on app initialization so that we know whether they need to be dropped and recreated or not."
