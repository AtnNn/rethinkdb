      "> think maybe we should just omit the pseudotype and put the pretty-printed form of the query in the jobs table for now\r\n\r\nWhich syntax should it use?  We have three official drivers each of which is *very* different from each other and each of which has some annoying misfeature (e.g. keyword arguments in JS and `lambda` in Python).  That was the whole reason to have the type in the first place, i.e. there *is* no sane common ground.  You yourself have complained that it's easier to just specify all three versions than fight with our polyglot tests.\r\n\r\nAlso I have written pretty printers before and I assure you it is easy.  Doing it four times is not meaningfully more difficult."
