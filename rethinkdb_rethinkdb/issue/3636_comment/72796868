      "> Which syntax should it use?\r\n\r\nI don't think it matters (but I'd opt for JavaScript). A database might run queries from clients written in completely different languages, and the person looking at the `jobs` table may or may not be familiar with those languages. I'm willing to bet that if we document that the `jobs` table uses a JavaScript notation people will say \"oh, ok\" and carry on with their work. Adding a pseudotype and printing the query in a specific language doesn't meaningfully improve the user experience IMO and doesn't seem worth doing. "
