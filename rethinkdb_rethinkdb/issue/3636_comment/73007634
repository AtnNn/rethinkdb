      "If we do introduce a pseudotype in 2.0, I think we should also add an optarg to `run` to control the results:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nr.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').run(query_format='string|native|raw')\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `'raw'` would tell the driver to print the pseudotype json\r\n- `'native'` would tell the driver to pretty-print the query locally\r\n- `'string'` would tell the server to send a pretty-printed string\r\n\r\nThis way people who use drivers that don't support the pseudotype can still get a reasonable pretty-printed string. I'd also make the default be `'string'` because I think it's the most useful option in most cases and would play well with third-party drivers out of the box."
