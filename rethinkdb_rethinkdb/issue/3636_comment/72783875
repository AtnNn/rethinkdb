      "I just talked about this with @coffeemug, and he sort of convinced me that this might not be worth the development effort right now.  Since the current state of this proposal involves writing a generic pretty-printer *anyway*, I think maybe we should just omit the pseudotype and put the pretty-printed form of the query in the jobs table for now.  If people complain, we can always add the pseudotype later, and the pretty-printing code won't have gone to waste or anything."
