      "Ruby is special here because the only way it supports passing optional arguments is passing them in a hash as the last argument of a function.  Some of our functions take a variable number of arguments, some of which may be objects, so to make sure we don't accidentally try to parse user data as a set of optional arguments we whitelist functions that accept optional arguments."
