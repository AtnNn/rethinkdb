      "See also #716.\r\n\r\nWe should make this use `:durability => 'hard'`, `:durability => 'soft'`, `':durability => 'default'` instead.  (Or some string other than \"default\", like \"inherit\"?) Or use the style `:durability => r.hard`?.  This way is more extensible if we ever want to add more types of durability.  MongoDB has more types of durability this way, as @wmrowan mentioned, like a distinction between \"fsync_safe\" and \"replicas_safe\".\r\n\r\n~~Maybe `:no_reply => true` should be replaced with `:durability => 'noreply'`?  I haven't thought about that for more than 1 second.~~"
