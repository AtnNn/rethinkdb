      "Thanks. I'd actually prefer to not have that last change in `varint.cc`.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that this code is part of Google's S2 library (we just copied it into our code base to make compilation easier and integrate it better). Having changes in that code will make it more difficult for us to merge upstream changes back into our code base.\r\nYou can try to submit that change to https://code.google.com/p/s2-geometry-library/\r\n\r\n(with cJSON it's actually similar but we have already adapted it somewhat, so there it's less critical)\r\n\r\nIf you revert the last commit bac742b this will be good to merge."
