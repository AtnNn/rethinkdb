        "Apparently we get surprised by launchpad build failures.  This means that we are not testing building RethinkDB on the set of environments that Launchpad uses.  What would these consist of?  Presumably other Ubuntu versions, one of 12.04, 12.10, 13.04.  I don't know.  We should not get surprised by failures caused by certain compilers not able to handle things like typename in certain places, we should have seen such failures long before."
