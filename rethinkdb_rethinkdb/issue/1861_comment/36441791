      "Just curious if the table and machine sizes are coupled? I'm looking at using rethinkdb for a project, and would like to scale it out horizontally over N number of machines, but the total number of tables might be relatively stable. So, 100 (or 100+) nodes would be important to me, but 100,000 tables, not so much. "
