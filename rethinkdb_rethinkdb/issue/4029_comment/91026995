      "@danielmewes not important. I was just trying to play with the changefeed feature, and the connection died when I tried to resize my terminal (as it got a SIGWINCH).\r\n\r\nI think this `wait`: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/ruby/lib/net.rb#L570 is getting a spurious wakeup.\r\n\r\nInstead of dying, it's probably better to loop until the wakeup condition is true (example of code: https://github.com/nviennot/synapse/blob/master/lib/promiscuous/redis/async.rb#L47-L52)\r\n\r\nThe wakeup condition should be something like `data_is_available || !is_connection_open()`"
