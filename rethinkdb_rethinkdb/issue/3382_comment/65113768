      "Sorry you ran into this @timjrobinson . Can you copy the output of `http://server:8080/ajax` (assuming RethinkDB runs on `server` with the web UI on port 8080) here? That might help us figuring out what's going on in your cluster.\r\n\r\nAre your servers directly connected to each other over an Ethernet or do you use any more complex networking setup?\r\n\r\nThe screenshot you posted shows some write queries going on in your cluster. Were you running any queries in the background or might those have been from a (very slow) backfill?\r\n\r\nAssigning to @timmaxw "
