      "@danielmewes Sorry about the delayed response. The servers are all Digital Ocean machines so they are directly connected via ethernet. I don't believe any queries were running I think those writes were the servers attempting to resync. \r\n\r\nI checked today and all the tables appear to have re-synced as availability is all green but the redundancy is still red so replicas aren't re-syncing quick enough.\r\n\r\nI changed one of the tables to have 16 shards instead of 8 and it appears to either be re-sharding very slowly or not at all. \r\n\r\n"
