      "I just noticed the master server (the one the others connect to) was running under quite high load (20 - 30). I rebooted the server and it things resynced fast for a while (2 - 3k writes and reads per second) then slowed down to 50 ish writes per second again. So I went through and restarted each machine and for each machine it did the same thing, bursted up in syncing before dying back down. \r\n\r\nI also deleted my sessions table which has 24 million rows... Need to figure out why they aren't being cleaned up. \r\n\r\nNow everything is green and seems to be working again. I'm not sure why the server got stuck in a state of high load and didn't fix itself but it looks like this is resolved now. The old turn it off and on again trick prevails again :)\r\n"
