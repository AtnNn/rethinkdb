      "@timjrobinson Thank you for the update. What sort of documents are you storing? What's their average size?\r\n\r\nIt seems like there's an issue with backfill speed under some circumstances here, not so much with servers not re-syncing at all (though if it's this slow that's bad enough of course).\r\n\r\n@paramaggarwal Do you remember if in your case you had backfill writes happening slowly, or if the system was completely stalled?"
