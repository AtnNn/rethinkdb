      "I had a similar situation recently when I was fiddling with RethinkDB. I had stored 5 million tweets from Twitter API on a cluster of two machines. I was fiddling with sharding values and removing adding machines. But eventually the sharding re-balance didn't resolve for me. Even after fiddling with the sharding values, restarting servers etc. Because my data was simply for experimentation, and I didn't quite know in what way to submit a bug for this, I was not able to report it."
