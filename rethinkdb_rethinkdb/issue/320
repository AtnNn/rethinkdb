        "Currently if the user clicks on a part of the query in the data explorer, it immediately shows a suggestion box for that part of the query. This results in an extremely annoying behavior because the user tries to click somewhere else to turn off the suggestion box to see a part of the query, but when they do that, another part of the query is obstructed.\r\n\r\nI think we should make the following changes to combat this problem:\r\n\r\n1. When the user clicks on a part of the query, the suggestion box should remain hidden\r\n2. The suggestion box should show up when the user starts typing again (via moving arrow keys or typing text)\r\n3. An exception to this is copy-paste, when the user copy pastes (via clicking, or keyboard shortcuts), the suggestion box should remain hidden."
