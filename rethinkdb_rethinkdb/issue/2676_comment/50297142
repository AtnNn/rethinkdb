      "Hi. I am having this same issue.\r\nAlthough my system (Debian Wheezy 7.5) has libnettle4 installed;\r\ngrant@FMDev:~$ sudo apt-cache show libnettle4\r\nPackage: libnettle4\r\nSource: nettle (2.7.1-2)\r\nVersion: 2.7.1-2+b1\r\nInstalled-Size: 292\r\nMaintainer: Magnus Holmgren <holmgren@debian.org>\r\nArchitecture: amd64\r\nDepends: libc6 (>= 2.14)\r\nPre-Depends: multiarch-support\r\nDescription-en: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)\r\n Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or\r\n less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,\r\n Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel\r\n space.\r\n .\r\n It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic\r\n algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a\r\n context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle\r\n doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the\r\n cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and\r\n in any way it needs.\r\n .\r\n This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic\r\n algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the\r\n asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.\r\nDescription-md5: 9dcb77a61a93b06eb5b005f9c8c509a4\r\nMulti-Arch: same\r\nHomepage: http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/\r\nTag: role::shared-lib\r\nSection: libs\r\nPriority: optional\r\nFilename: pool/main/n/nettle/libnettle4_2.7.1-2+b1_amd64.deb\r\nSize: 172382\r\nMD5sum: 3a9ba3ea22ff79dde5d767e1cef7cf7d\r\nSHA1: 30dbeebfbefb20ec226d51d2af52fea8f8f40d2e\r\nSHA256: 92f67a7a726d0204c61ce667094720f5cc3e534f09c39e0aebdc66ae68ddd8b5\r\n\r\ngrant@FMDev:~$ \r\n\r\nAs you can see nettle is at version 2.7 and make can not find it.\r\nIs there a fix for this?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nGrant."
