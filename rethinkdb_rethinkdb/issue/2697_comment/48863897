      "Naturally this issue interacts with #2059 a bit.  We're going to check the hard array size limit sometime specifically before or during serialization of datums -- which would prevent these oversized datums from getting serialized to disk, in this case.  Once #2059 is done, this issue should be able to be changed to say that we're not checking the soft array size limit."
