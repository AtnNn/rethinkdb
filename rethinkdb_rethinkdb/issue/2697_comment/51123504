      "The regression test in 1e3f1b7 does not show that the problem is fixed, because they operate on insert/removal operations, and the array size limits for datum serialization itself would cause an exception to be thrown.\r\n\r\nTo show that the problem is fixed, we can run something like `r.expr((function() { var x = []; for (var i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) { x.push(i); } return x; })()).spliceAt(0, [2]).count()`."
