      "Note that we can't simply change the code to add the array size limit check, because existing secondary index functions in 1.13 databases would then produce inconsistent output.  Unless we want to hope that nobody encounters this.  We need a way to either migrate existing secondary indexes that hit this bug, temporarily having secondary index functions evaluated with older semantics of ReQL.  Or, we could eschew migration for now and just support evaulating with the older semantics of ReQL (and this would be step 1 in either case, anyway).   (@gchpaco: We have just added file format compatibility last release and this is one facet of that which we have not yet implemented.)"
