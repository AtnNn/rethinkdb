      "We need to support write implementations on older indexes for the reasons described in #2701, #2789.  So that users can keep using their indexes after upgrading and then migrate without a loss of availability.\r\n\r\nInsertAt and spliceAt are not mutation.  They are pure functions that can run inside of secondary indexes."
