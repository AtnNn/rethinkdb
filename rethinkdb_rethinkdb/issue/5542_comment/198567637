      "@abovemike I looked into this with @mlucy and we believe we understand where the bug came from. Unfortunately the fix will require changes to the on-disk format, and is outside the scope if a bug fix release (2.2.6). Instead we will fix it for RethinkDB 2.3, which isn't that far away either.\r\n\r\nWe also noticed that your index function probably is one nesting too deep with respect to the output. The outer `map` should probably be a `concatMap`. That too should avoid the crash in your particular case."
