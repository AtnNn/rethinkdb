      "Handling memory allocation failures is impossible.  The man-years needed to accomplish this in RethinkDB is around 15, and that's if we halt further development on the product.  The right behavior isn't to throw an exception, it's to crash immediately -- std::bad_alloc can also be caused by memory corruption and other forms of corrupt behavior."
