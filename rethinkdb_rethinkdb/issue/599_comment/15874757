      "There are a few difficulties here:\r\n\r\n* On many systems the OOM killer will just send the process `SIGKILL` and we won't have any chance to handle the exception.\r\n* We have a lot of functions with `THROWS_ONLY` specifications that would all need to be updated to note that they can also throw this.  We'd also have to check a lot of our code where we have `THROWS_NOTHING` specifications to make sure that the code above is exception-safe.\r\n\r\nI think we should instead focus our energy on pre-emptively evicting things from cache and aborting queries when we start to run low on memory."
