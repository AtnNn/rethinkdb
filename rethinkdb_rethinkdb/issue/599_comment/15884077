      "By the way: The OOM killer can be disabled on all Linux systems. So given the \"kill the offending queue\" feature was implemented, an administrator who cares about the availability of their database machine could simply configure the server appropriately.\r\n\r\n    echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory\r\n\r\nNow out of memory conditions will fail immediately when the memory is allocated. No OOM killer involved.\r\n\r\n    echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory\r\n\r\nRestores the default behavior (programs will be granted more memory than available, as it is expected that most of them will never actually use all of it)."
