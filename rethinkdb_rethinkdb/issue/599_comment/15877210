      "> On many systems the OOM killer will just send the process SIGKILL\r\n\r\nYes, this fix would be for systems where a tcmalloc issue happens before the OOM killer (some people run into that).\r\n\r\n> `THROWS_ONLY` ... `THROWS_NOTHING`\r\n\r\nI'd treat this the way Java does with RuntimeExceptions. We just say that some exceptions can pretty much be thrown anywhere, no matter what throws declarations we have (such as an out-of-memory exception). The purpose is not to recover from these, but to catch them all the way on top of the stack and fail gracefully."
