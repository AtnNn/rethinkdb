        "I have a table where I create a query as:\r\n```\r\nr.db('mydb').table('mytable').filter(r.row('field').gt(1000))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I generate its toString representation I get:\r\n```\r\nr.db('mydb').table('mytable').filter(function(var_2) { return r.row(\"field\").gt(1000); })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fails to execute with the error:\r\n```\r\nRqlCompileError: Cannot use r.row in nested queries.  Use functions instead.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my rethink-miner case I would like the user to create the query by going through the webapp and then save the resulting query. This is a rather unusual use-case but in general the ReQL makes for a very straightforward building of queries in stages. Would be nice to be able to have an output that would be executable later on in the same way."
