      "* Probably a lot of people will run `r.table_reconfigure(dry_run=True)`, extract the split points, and then combine those split points with their own manually-generated configuration.\r\n\r\n* We should consider giving people a way to generate the configuration for a hypothetical future table. It would be sort of like a `dry_run=True` version of `r.table_create()`. Perhaps they could do this by passing `None` for the table name and `dry_run=True`. (Passing `None` with `dry_run=False` would be an error.)"
