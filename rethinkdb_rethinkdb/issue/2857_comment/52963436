      "I agree, except I'm confused by this statement:\r\n\r\n> If they set up tags and tag-based replication via scripts, then reconfigure in the Web UI, they lose the tag information.\r\n\r\nLose what tag information? We shouldn't reset the servers' tag information when they reconfigure in the web UI, and the tag information passed to `table.reconfigure()` isn't persisted in the first place. Or did you mean that they aren't able to specify tags when reconfiguring in the web UI?"
