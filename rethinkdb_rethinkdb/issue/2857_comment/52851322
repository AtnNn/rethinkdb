      "I'm catching up with all the clustering issues, but the fact that we do not persist the settings per tag is a huge problem with the web interface.\r\n\r\nIt basically means that we cannot tell people here's your configuration for table \"test\":\r\ntag: \"america\", replica: 2\r\ntag: \"europe\", replica: 2\r\ntag: \"asia\", replica: 2\r\n\r\n\r\nI know that I'm quite late in the discussion, but not persisting settings per tag seems like a pretty bad idea to me."
