      "If you add a server in your cluster with tag `foo`, and want to increase the number of replicas to 1 for `foo` on a certain table, it means that you need to remember what were your previous settings if you want to use the high level API.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm strongly opposed of providing only the low level API on the web interface.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if they have a script, it means that they have to persist the settings themselves somewhere. There is no reason to put the burden on the users."
