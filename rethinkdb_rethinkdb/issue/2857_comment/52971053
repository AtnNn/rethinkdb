      "> Or do you want to forbid people from using tags when setting replicas? So we always set the replica/acks for the default tag?\r\n\r\nThat's what I thought we were talking about. In other words, the user can call `table.reconfigure(x,y)` through the web UI, where `x` and `y` are integers, but they can't call any other form of `table.reconfigure()` through the web UI. We would default `x` to the current number of shards and `y` to the current number of servers per shard, without regard to what tags are on the servers in the current config.\r\n\r\n> In which case, can we enforce the tag (make sure it cannot be removed).\r\n\r\nThere's a legitimate use case for removing it. If you want to decommission a machine, the first step is to remove all of its tags, including `default` or `active` or whatever we went to call it. "
