      "Also note that you can reconstruct the number of shards and the number of replicas from `table_config`. It's only the per-tag information that you can't reconstruct. If we were to forbid overlapping tags, then you could reconstruct pretty much everything (although I think we decided to allow overlapping tags).\r\n\r\nWe could also use cookies in the web UI to store some of these parameters.\r\n\r\nI'm a little worried that if we store the previous parameters, then users will think that the cluster is using the persisted values of those parameters to control replication."
