      "I think we should change the web UI to work in the following ways:\r\n\r\n- Users should be able to specify number of shards/replicas. We should also show them state (existing number of shards/replicas) computed from the low-level API, so adding/removing one is easy.\r\n- Users can't manipulate tags from the Web UI. If they set up tags and tag-based replication via scripts, then reconfigure in the Web UI, they lose the tag information.\r\n\r\nI think this would work really well for novice users and even advanced users who don't use tags. But once you move to tags, you can't use the Web UI to manipulate them. This sounds like a good compromise."
