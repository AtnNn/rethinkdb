      "I'm a little lost with all the issues, but hopefully this is a reasonable thread for this comment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I have three servers `server1`, `server2` and `server3`, all with the tag `default`.\r\nIf I use the high level API to as for 2 replicas on tag `default`, and the master is on `server1` and the replica is on `server2`.\r\n\r\nIf `server2` goes down, and I declare it dead, I then have to call again reconfigure, which we currently do not need. As soon as a server is declared dead, we'll move replicas around.\r\n\r\nAlso we should provide a way to get the current configuration such that people don't need to remember what were the previous settings (not sure if this is already part of the spec)"
