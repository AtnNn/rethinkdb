      "> Users should be able to specify number of shards/replicas. We should also show them state (existing number of shards/replicas) computed from the low-level API, so adding/removing one is easy.\r\n\r\nThis is possible only if the tags do not overlap. What do we display if some tags overlap?\r\n\r\nThey could have tags to filter servers, and even if they do not use them when setting replicas, we can't tell them what are the previous settings.\r\n\r\nOr do you want to forbid people from using tags when setting replicas? So we always set the replica/acks for the default tag? In which case, can we enforce the tag (make sure it cannot be removed).\r\n"
