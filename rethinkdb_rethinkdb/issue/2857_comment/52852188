      "The proposal is that the web UI would show the user a \"Reconfigure\" button which pops up a dialog box where they could choose a number of shards, fill in the number of replicas for different tags, choose a director tag, etc. It could use `dry_run=True` to show a preview of what changes would be made. Then the user would click \"OK\" and it would call `table.reconfigure()` internally.\r\n\r\nThe web UI would also show them which servers were active for which shards and allow them to change the settings directly. The changes would be translated into writes on the `table_config` pseudo-table.\r\n\r\nThis feels like a question of usability, and I don't have a good sense for what's usable and what's not."
