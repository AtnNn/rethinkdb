      "Do you know which version of `libtool` Nix is linking into the sandbox?\r\n\r\nI think the V8 build system assumes the XCode version, not the GNU one.\r\n\r\nWonder if there's a patch for the Nix v8 packages or if there's a different reason for why they don't encounter the issue.\r\n\r\nUsing an existing V8 is tricky because we also use the ICU header files from V8."
