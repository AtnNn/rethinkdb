      "`v8`'s way of including ICU is a bit complex, and they actually use a modified version that has the ICU table expanded. My understanding is that this later bit it to allow `v8` to use virtual memory much more efficiently if you have a lot of instances going (which is common). A couple of us here (I am only the most recent) have done battle with this setup a few times, and there are a lot of hoops to jump though.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we strongly prefer using the version of `v8` that we have. They have been changing the API regularly, so trying to cover system versions is a difficult moving target."
