      "Indeed, the libtool comes from gcc. I'll try using the XCode one.\r\n\r\nAs for the icu header files, if regular icu is not visible during build but v8 is, that should be the ones that are picked, right? Any way to check what is being used, something to grep in the resulting binaries perhaps?\r\n\r\nI also just noticed that the Nix v8 build is configured to use the system ICU. What is the reason for wanting to use the bundled ICU?"
