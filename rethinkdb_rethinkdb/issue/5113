        "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have an issue with a table when I try to copy it to a new table using the data explorer. The job seems to run well for some time, but after a while I get the following error: e: Query terminated by an unknown cause in ... \r\n\r\nWonder how I can dig deeper here to find the error message or if it's possible to understand the origin of the error. It's a table with around 250K entries that I'm trying to copy.\r\n\r\nTo copy I use the following command: r.db('db').table('table1').insert(r.db('db').table('table2').pluck('field'))\r\n\r\nTable has around 250K entries.\r\n\r\nIt runs for some time, then fails with the error above. Tried to look in the output from rethinkdb but nothing there.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
