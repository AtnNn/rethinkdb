      "One more thought: We currently have three `_debug` tables in the `rethinkdb` database: `_debug_scratch` (basically an in-memory table for testing that you can save arbitrary documents in), `_debug_table_status` (extended version of `table_status`) and `_debug_stats` (extended version of `stats`).\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that we should disallow access to these for all non-admin users. While I don't think there's much harm that a user could do by accessing these tables (other than maybe overload memory by writing to `_debug_scratch` or using it as a hidden channel), forbidding access feels safer to me. Someone might grant access to the `rethinkdb` database for a user, and not be aware of the existence of the `_debug` tables (since they are hidden and not documented).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, restricting access to the `admin` user only would also mean that you cannot override this restriction by granting permissions on a `_debug` table explicitly (due to the way permission checking is implemented).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone think it would be better to allow access to these tables for non-admin users?"
