      "I think hiding tables based on permissions would be pretty confusing, because people with permissions set incorrectly will think their tables just disappeared.  Adding an optarg to `tableList` and `dbList` that you can set to only get tables you can read from, write to, or administrate seems like a reasonable option though."
