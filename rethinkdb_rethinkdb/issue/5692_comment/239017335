      "Note that this comment is essentially a brain dump resulting from a discussion @danielmewes and I had in person.\r\n\r\n- The system database and tables will only have read and write permissions, the config permission can be set but since no configuration changes can currently be made to either the database or tables this doesn't have any impact.\r\n- The system database and tables will not inherit permissions from the global scope, this means global read and write permissions can be set for real tables and will not influence configuration permissions through writing to the system tables.\r\n- Writing to either the `db_config` or `table_config` will also check whether you have `config` permissions to these objects. The object is considered the primary and the system tables a view on these.\r\n- `r.grant` will check whether you have permissions on the `permissions` system table, here the system table is considered the primary and `grant` a shortcut to writing to this table.\r\n- As stated above we will limit all `_debug` tables to the admin user only."
