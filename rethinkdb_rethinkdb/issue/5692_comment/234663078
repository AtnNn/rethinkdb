      "@marshall007 The current implementation has all tables and databases visible to everybody, even if they don't have any permissions to read or write to them.\r\n\r\nDo you have a use case for which you'd want these commands to filter our inaccessible tables?\r\n\r\nNote that even if we filter out tables with no permissions, your application would often still need to handle permission errors when accessing the table(s), since a user might only have read but not write or config permissions. There are probably a few cases where all you need is read permissions, and there it would usually work out."
