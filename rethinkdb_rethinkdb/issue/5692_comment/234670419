      "@danielmewes I don't have any specific use-cases in mind. It just seems like more appropriate behavior since otherwise (currently) there are pitfalls associated with `.tableList().forEach(...)` and permissions.\r\n\r\nIt would be a nice solution to #5946 and even more handy once changefeeds are supported in #5517.\r\n\r\nYou make a good point though that depending on what you're trying to do you may wish to filter based on permissions other than `read`. Perhaps it would make sense to add an optarg? I guess the main point here is that `db/tableList` are not easy to use once you start adding permissions, but they should be."
