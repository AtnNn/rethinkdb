      "I suspect this is because we use a repeating timer with a period about the same as the election timeout to check if it's time to start a new election. The phase difference between two servers' timers can give one of them a much higher probability of winning the election. Shortening the timer period should fix the problem, but we should make sure it's not a potential CPU hog if there are a lot of Raft instances running."
