Unfortunately, this is truly raw, since the dataexplorer requests times in raw format so it can format them itself.\n\nIdeally, we'd keep the json in memory, but cut out a page-sized slice of the results for actual formatting. This way we'd never get too much formatting lag (though really heavily nested/large documents could still present a problem).\n"
