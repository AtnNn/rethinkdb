      "Thanks for reporting this @anatol .\r\nDoes the same happen on `v2.2.4` if you compile with the same version of GCC?\r\n\r\nThis issue might already be addressed in `next` by https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4437#issuecomment-118491138 . We could look into backporting parts of that patch to `v2.2.x`. Unfortunately the patch as a whole broke compilation on OS X on `v2.2.x` the last time I tried applying it."
