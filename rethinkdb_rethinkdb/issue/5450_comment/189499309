      "@anatol Is applying the patch a workable solution for you for the moment? This patch is already in `next` for 2.3.0, but we haven't been successful in applying it to `v2.2.x` without breaking compilation on other platforms (namely on Mac).\r\nIf it's important, we could look more into backporting it to `v2.2.x`. Otherwise it will become unnecessary later when we ship 2.3."
