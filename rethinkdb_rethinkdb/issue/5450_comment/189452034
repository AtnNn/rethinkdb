      "Hmm I was looking at the version in `next` earlier which changed, but in v2.2.5 we actually check for `_GNU_SOURCE` in this function: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/v2.2.5/src/errors.cc#L90\r\n\r\nHowever the patch from the Alpinelinux thread disables the check (I'm not sure why). So it looks like that needs to be enabled again.\r\n\r\n"
