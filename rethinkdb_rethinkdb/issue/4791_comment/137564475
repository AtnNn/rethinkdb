      "Marking this a proposal, which we will discuss for one of the upcoming releases.\r\n\r\nI have some concerns about the first part of this:\r\n\r\n1. `r.min` and `r.max` are not limited to numbers, but can be used on all data types. `null` is currently just another data type in ReQL, and it sorts between booleans and numbers (see http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/data-types/#sorting-order). So we would probably need to change a lot more if we wanted to ignore `null` in `r.min` and `r.max` while remaining consistent.\r\n\r\nI think we should consider the optarg though."
