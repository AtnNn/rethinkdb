      "@danielmewes if the proposed optarg ignored all \"falsey\" values instead of just `0` then not changing the behavior of `r.min/max` would be fine.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if something could be done about the current inconsistency, but I can see where getting `null` back makes sense for other types. When you are dealing with numeric types though, it is quite odd to get back a value for `r.sum`, but then possibly `null` from `r.min` on the same set of data."
