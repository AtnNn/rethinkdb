      "Hmm `page_t::add_waiter()` seems to move the page into the `_unevictable` bag already. `catch_up_with_deferred_load()` is called by `deferred_page_loader_t::added_waiter()` which in turn is called by `page_t::add_waiter()`, after `page_t::add_waiter()` has already changed the eviction bag.\r\nSo `catch_up_with_deferred_load()` comes a little late to the party when it tries to change the eviction bag from evicted to unevictable by calling `evicter_t::catch_up_deferred_load()`."
