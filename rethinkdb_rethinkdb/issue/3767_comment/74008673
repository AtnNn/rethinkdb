      "This appears to be because `r.range(...)` does not respect `batchspec_t::all()` by adding a `.with_at_most(500)` to the end.  This would suggest that accumulating any `r.range(...)` stream larger than 500 elements would fail.  The good news is that this is an `r_sanity_check`, so it won't crash the release server."
