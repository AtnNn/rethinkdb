      "@coffeemug It wouldn't be a big problem if it was removed in my case. It's more convenient if you can run the same benchmark script for soft and hard durability without needing to pass around any additional configuration, but it's easy enough to change in my case.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is a lot more convenient to specify it at table creation. Typically I think you want the same kind of durability for all writes to a given table. If you have to specify it each time individually you have to keep track of which kind of data needs which durability in your application. Nothing difficult, just one more thing to take care of when designing application code."
