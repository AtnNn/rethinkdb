        "I think we should accept 1-ary addition, subtraction, and multiplication on the server, with the same meaning as in Common Lisp (1-ary addition and multiplication is a no-op, 1-ary subtraction is negation).  I also think we should consider having 1-ary division just for consistency (in CL that's a no-op as well).\n\nI think we should update the Python client so that `-x` turns into `r.sub(x)` on the server, unless we agree not to support that, in which case it should turn into `r.sub(0, x)`.\n\nSee also #1184.\n"
