        "Following discussion with @coffeemug regarding rethinkdb/docs#467, we decided it would be least-confusing for users to have the `r.binary` term also operate on the server when operating on other terms.\n\nInternally, `r.binary` will just run the same code as `coerce_to('binary')`.\n\nScheduling for 1.14 since we don't want people to be confused by `r.binary` in the first version.\n"
