      "I'd like to propose one exception from the rules above:\r\nThe `jobs` table should only be readable by the admin user for now.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that `jobs` exposes all sorts of queries that contain secret data (e.g. password of other users if they're currently changing theirs).\r\nA common scenario is setting up a \"read only\" user with global read permissions. Such a user could escalate its privileges by reading passwords of other users from the `jobs` table.\r\n\r\nIf it's easy to do, we can think about filtering `jobs` output so users only see their own queries unless they are `admin`.\r\nI think it would be ok to leave that refinement for later though."
