        "Hey guys, thanks for your sexyawesome database.\n\nI'm tinkering around with some timeseries stuff using the hot new time data types. I've got some data that looks like this:\n\n```\n[\n  { \"count\": 10, \"ts\": r.time(2013, 1, 1, 5, 23, 13, 'Z') },\n  ...\n]\n```\n\nSo in this example I've got datapoints at second intervals. I'd like to query them in bigger groups; for instance: what is the total count for each hour?\n\nRight now I'm doing something like this (in Ruby):\n\n``` ruby\nr.table(\"ev\").grouped_map_reduce(\n  lambda { |row| [row[:ts].year, row[:ts].month, row[:ts].day, row[:ts].hours] },\n  lambda { |row| row.pluck(:value) },\n  lambda { |acc, row| {:value => acc[:value] + row[:value]} }\n).run\n```\n\nThis works, but it somewhat annoying:\n- `[row[:ts].year, row[:ts].month, row[:ts].day, row[:ts].hours]` is repetitive and ugly\n- Now I have to reconstruct the date from an array like `[2013, 1, 1, 4]` at the receiving end\n\nI think it would be fixed with a `round()` function for times that could round the time to the nearest {hour, minute, second, day, arbitrary time span, ...}.\n\nOff the top of my head, one model for such a function would be [the `Time.Round` function from the time package in the Go standard library](http://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Round).\n"
