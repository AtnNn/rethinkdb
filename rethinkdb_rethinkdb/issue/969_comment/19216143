      "There's also some question of if we want to recommend to people that they coerce to array here. Looking at the query @neumino wrote there if he were to follow that advice it's likely he's going to just wind up running afoul of the OOM killer and what he really wants to do is restructure the query to return a stream. That's hard to recommend though.\r\n\r\nAlso do we have a static limit on the size of arrays? That would at least make it unlikely for such a query to crash the server."
