      "@mlucy In my mind in javascript the callback would be called once with the object so in the example we have going your callback would be called with the object `{\"foo\" : CursorObject, \"bar\" : CursorObject}`. Then each of those cursor objects would have an `iterate` method so you could say things like:\r\n```Javascript\r\nobject[\"foo\"].iterate(function (doc) { alert(doc['value']); }\r\n```\r\nThe only question is what happens now when the result of the query is a single stream. We could do what we're doing now and just say that if a query returns a single stream we automatically use the callback to iterate it. In one sense this is nice because it saves you some typing on the other hand this is something that separates the Javascript drivers from the other drivers and it makes something that's fairly reasonable in the other 2 a bit weird in javascript.\r\n\r\nMy sense is that it'll be painful for people to have to change how they handle streams at this point so we shouldn't change it but I also think that having this little wart in Javascript might be okay since being able to return multiple cursors is actually pretty nice."
