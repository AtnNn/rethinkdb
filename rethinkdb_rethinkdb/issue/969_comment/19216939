      "@mlucy you misunderstand. I'm saying you never have to deal with arrays at all. If you run:\r\n`{\"foo\" : r.table(\"foo\"), \"bar\" : r.table(\"bar\"}`\r\nYou get back a dict with cursor objects as the values (and strings as the keys). It would require moving the protobuf file around a bit. But I actually don't see any reason it's not doable and I think it might save people having to hit snags in the type system.\r\n\r\nAlso this has some interesting effects on other issues for example if you could return more than one stream from the same query then `r.table(\"foo\").group(...)` could actually return some very meaningful and useful results. (Although there are some other issues with this.)"
