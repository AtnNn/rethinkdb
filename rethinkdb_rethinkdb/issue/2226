        "The first few queries sent to an instance after it has restarted or after the cluster configuration has changed often fail with a `No master available` error. This happens even in a single-instance cluster.\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful if the server made an effort to find the master, or at least polled the status of the master for a while instead of immediately failing with an error.\r\n\r\nRelated to #1811."
