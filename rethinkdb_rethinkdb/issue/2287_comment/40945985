      "There are two things here that explain the current behavior:\r\n\r\n- The `table` command doesn't guarantee any order\r\n- The `reduce` command doesn't guarantee any order -- it may use the same order on an array though? -- ping @mlucy\r\n\r\nSee http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/map-reduce/ -- section \"How map/reduce queries are executed\"\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure what the last reduce does, but it's not safe (see acticle linked before). If you add a document, you may get different results.\r\n\r\n\r\nClosing since it's not a bug. If I misunderstood something, feel free to reopen.\r\nAnd if you have more questions, let me know : )"
