      "The important line linked there is:\r\n\r\n>  The function provided to reduce is not called successively on the elements of the stream from left to right -- it's called on either the elements of the stream, in any order, or on the output of previous calls to the function.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, when doing a map/reduce, the map operation should put everything into an array (if an array is the return type you want), and then the reduce operation takes arrays and combines them into larger arrays.  (If the result type wanted was a number, then your map function would produce a number, and the reduce operation would combine two numbers together.)"
