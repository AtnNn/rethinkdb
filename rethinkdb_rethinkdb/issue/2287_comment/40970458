      "I'm not concerned about the order of the items returned, just the fact that \"a\" (one of the document keys) is included in the output.  I understand that the reduction function can be called on the list elements in any order (or the output of any previous calls to the function), but I'm not sure how that could result in one of the document keys being included in the output list."
