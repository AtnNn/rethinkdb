      "> I'm not concerned about the order of the items returned, just the fact that \"a\" (one of the document keys) is included in the output.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, it's not just about the order of the elements. Sometimes the function passed to `reduce` will be called on an element and an accumulator, and sometimes it will be called on two elements. This is done for parallelization, and you can't control which way the function will be called and when.\r\n\r\nThe difference between 1.11 and 1.12 is that `reduce` no longer accepts the optional base, which is what's causing RethinkDB to return `'a'`.
