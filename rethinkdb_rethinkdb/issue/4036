        "I am simply trying to read all selected fields from a RethinkDB table into memory to construct a pandas DataFrame from it.\nThe table is indexed by an integer primary key and the database runs only one a single machine.\nThe code to read the data is:\n\n```\n    res = []\n    for doc in r.db(db_name).table(table).pluck(keys).run(conn):\n        res.append(doc)\n    return pd.DataFrame(res).set_index(pk).sort_index()\n```\n\nThe table has only 150k documents, each document has roughly 250 values, 10 columns, one column is an array of 240 values.\n\nThe database seems to stall, nothing happens for minutes then a \"burst\" of reads happens.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nIt's been 4 hours and my documents are still not fetched. I am using rethinkdb 1.16.3~0trusty (GCC 4.8.2).\n\nThanks\n\n![db1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i3Mva.png)\n\n![db2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/s1Ygu.png)\n"
