      "I actually think `filter` and `update` are the 2 really important ones. Mongo also has a syntax like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable.update { db.collection.update( { $inc: { counter : 5 } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOurs would be just as good I think:\r\n```\r\ntable.update({\"counter\" : r.add(5)})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think if we implemented currying in those 2 places we could see how nice of a backend implementation of it we could get and also gauge people's reaction to this type of interface."
