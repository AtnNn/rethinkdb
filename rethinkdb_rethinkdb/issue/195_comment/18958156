      "Realistically, I don't think this will happen for at least three months. As of now there are three essential areas we have to tackle:\r\n\r\n* Basic missing features (e.g. date support, atomic update-and-get, dealing with nested objects, etc.)\r\n* Performance and stability\r\n* Integration with the ecosystem (cloud services, better docs, integration with web frameworks, etc.)\r\n\r\nIn my mind triggers are a nice-to-have that don't fit into any of the essential areas (for now). As we deal with low hanging fruit and move up the tree we'll get to triggers, but there are many more essential things we have to get done before that."
