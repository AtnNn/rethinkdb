      "To clarify:\r\nOne person (Rasuthus) said: \"I suppose im trying to avoid having to use a distributed task queue.\" And wound up being happy to just be able to atomically update documents to make a sort of hacky distributed lock system. So I don't think this is a person who really wants to complexity of a task queue.\r\n\r\nThe other (donpdonp) wanted to be able to watch a table for changes. There was never any mention of a message queue although watching a table for changes is most of a message queue."
