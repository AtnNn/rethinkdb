      "Basically, instead of having RethinkDb server -> daemon -> rabbitMQ -> client(s), you would just have RethinkDB server -> client(s). It doesn't eliminate the issue of the client failing, but it removes two pieces that might fail (though the daemon is much more likely to fail than the rabbitMQ server in practice)."
