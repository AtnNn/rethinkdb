      "I have a couple of thoughts on this:\r\n\r\n1. Implementing a good, general purpose, scalable messaging system is quite difficult and is fairly different from what we set out to do in spirit, architecture, and basic abstractions.\r\n2. This is a detail that can be worked out, but nevertheless, your proposal significantly complicates the clients because `.listen(...)` implies the server sends a message to the client out of band, there is some sort of client-side message loop, etc.\r\n3. I think the correct basic primitives here are triggers. I think that coupled with a few other magical things we eventually plan to ship, one could build a system like this fairly easily.\r\n\r\nSince multiple people requested this, I'm moving to backlog, let's revisit when a few more key features are built."
