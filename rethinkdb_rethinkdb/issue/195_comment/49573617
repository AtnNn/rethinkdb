      "@deontologician very interested to see an integration example. I'm thinking one about one now, will have to write one this month. Use case is activity feed gathering, processing, distributing, archiving. Worries that come to mind include recovering from dropping the change stream. \r\n\r\n@coffeemug WRT \"Over the next few months we'll be making change feeds more powerful\", is there an issue that comes to mind?"
