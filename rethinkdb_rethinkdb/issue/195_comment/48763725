      "@joeyespo -- RethinkDB now has changefeeds support (http://rethinkdb.com/docs/changefeeds/). You can use it as a simple pub/sub system and it works quite well! Over the next few months we'll be making change feeds more powerful, and as more functionality is introduced, the pub/sub capabilities will increase.\r\n\r\nI don't think we'll add explicit pub/sub support since there are much better dedicated products designed to solve this problem (although we might add porcelain commands on top of changefeeds to save people some typing)."
