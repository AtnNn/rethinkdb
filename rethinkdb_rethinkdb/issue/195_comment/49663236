      "@dminkovsky, I'm working on a recipe/pseudo-library now that implements message queueing as a pattern on top of RethinkDB. This would alleviate the extra point of failure (the daemon pushing changes from rethink to rabbit). It wouldn't have as fully-featured routing capabilities as something like RabbitMQ, but it might be useful in a lot of cases where an industrial strength message queue isn't needed.\r\n\r\nI'll post an update soon. In the meantime, the tutorial on RethinkDB -> RabbitMQ is approved, so it should be up on the site soon."
