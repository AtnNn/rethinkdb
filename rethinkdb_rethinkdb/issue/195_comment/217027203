      "@dminkovsky Hi Josh,\r\n\r\nAny news on this?\r\n> I'm working on a recipe/pseudo-library now that implements message queueing as a pattern on top of RethinkDB. This would alleviate the extra point of failure (the daemon pushing changes from rethink to rabbit). It wouldn't have as fully-featured routing capabilities as something like RabbitMQ, but it might be useful in a lot of cases where an industrial strength message queue isn't needed.\r\n\r\nMy project currently only has two storage service dependencies being RethinkDB and the File System. I need a job queue and the options on NPM seem to all require Redis or RabbitMQ etc. For a simple job/task list (in this case sending emails) I was hoping to avoid adding a new dependency to the project. I had a look at the [repubsub](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/publish-subscribe/javascript/) on the RethinkDB site, however this is not persistent. I was thinking about rolling my own and found this issue after a general search.\r\n\r\nRegards."
