        "It would be nice if `replace` returned `generated_keys`, like `insert` does when inserts happen.\r\n\r\nThe use case here is to do something like \"Atomically updating a document based on a condition\" from the Cookbook. If a new record is created, I'd like to know that record's ID without having to do `returnChanges: true` and pick it out of the larger structure."
