      "No, I don't think my premise is wrong. Even for a \"big\" table we shouldn't be loading 713MB of data just to return a 10KB row to the user. Even if that's a small fraction of the total table size it's still too slow for what should be an almost instantaneous query. Under what circumstances should a query that accesses 1 row (or some limited number of rows as in the `.limit(10)` case) load several orders of magnitude more data than we actually need to complete the query?"
