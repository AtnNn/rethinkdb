      "It is only loading a small number of disk blocks into the buffer cache, it's just that because this isn't the case that we optimize for what's small for another query seems big for this. It's a ways in the future that we'll be optimizing for specific queries like this I think. A better optimization we could make is actually looking at the size of the result we're return rather than just the total number of rows returned.\r\n\r\nThe premise of this issue is incorrect and misleading so I'm going to close it and replace it with an issue about paying attention to memory returned from rgets instead of just counts since that's actually actionable and specific. If you want a separate issue for optimizing the `[0]` operation you could add that as well but I think that's one of a million specific optimizations and enumerating them right now is just going to increase signal to noise.\r\n\r\nIn general please try to check your premises before you post issues."
