        "Currently the JavaScript YAML tests translate 'a_b' patterns to 'aB', which translate the ReQL commands from Ruby/Python to the JavaScript equivalent. But the problem is that it also sucks in other words, and occasionally this means that bugs slip into the tests (e.g.: #2837). The translation eliminates duplication but leads to these, sometimes subtle, bugs and requires people keep this in mind whenever writing YAML tests.\n\nThere are a few proposed solutions to this, and we need to make a decision on one of them:\n1. Create a white-list of things to translate and only translate those. This could be automated by analyzing the Python driver and using the names there as a list.\n2. Do away with the translation system and require that each YAML sub-test have the explicit language.\n3. The second option, but make a script for modifying the YAML files to hide the details. So you would write the test in one language and it would offer the auto-translated versions for you to examine/edit.\n"
