      "@danielmewes \r\n\r\n1. How can I access the webUI for each of the replicas in the cluster? Wouldn't it defeat the point of a dashboard if we have more than a webUI for a cluster? We use rethinkdbdash for conneciton pooling - is there an easier way to get you server_status of each of the replicas without connecting to them individually?\r\n\r\n2. I have emailed you the _debug_table_status? "
