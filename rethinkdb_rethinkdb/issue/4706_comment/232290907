      "I have experienced this recently in 2.3.4 with near identical symptoms. IPs had changed, nodes could communicate with each-other, but Raft could not gain a consensus. My workaround was to add `--server-tag (master|slave)` to each of the configs. It seemed to flush any stored config.\r\n\r\nApologies for dragging up an old ticket."
