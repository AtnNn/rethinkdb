      "You can also use rethinkdbdash to connect to the other servers, but please make sure that the `discovery` parameter is turned off and that you're only passing in one host name, or `rethinkdbdash` will automatically spread the connections over multiple servers.\r\nSee https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash for how to set `discovery` (I think it actually defaults to `false`, so that should work)."
