      "@cggaurav Thanks for sending over the `_debug_table_status` output!\r\n\r\nWhile the dashboard generally accumulates issues and stats from across the cluster, this doesn't always work for connectivity issues where the connectivity is inconsistent across servers.\r\n(see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4936 for an attempt to improve this)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is no other way to get the individual server's connectivity without connecting to it directly. Depending on what your network setup looks like, you might be able to just point your browser to port 8080 of the server that you want to connect to. Or if port 8080 is behind a firewall, but you are able to `ssh` into the server, you can use an ssh tunnel:\r\n`ssh -L 8081:localhost:8080 <server>`\r\nand then open the web UI via `http://localhost/8081` on your local machine.\r\n"
