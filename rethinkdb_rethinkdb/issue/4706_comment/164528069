      "@cggaurav in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5206 you mention that you've since run into the same symptoms that @wereHamster described above.\r\n\r\nIn most cases where I've seen this, the issue was incomplete network connectivity within the cluster. Often servers were able to connect to another server in one direction, but the other server was unable to open a connection back.\r\n\r\nCould you do the following checks in order to debug this?\r\n\r\n1. Connect to each server in the cluster individually and directly (you can either use the web UI or any client driver, as long as it doesn't automatically create a connection pool to multiple servers). Then run the following query on each of them: `r.db('rethinkdb').table('server_status')`.\r\n  This will reveal if any pair of servers can't see each other.\r\n2. If nothing shows up in 1, run the previously mentioned `r.db('rethinkdb').table('_debug_table_status')`. The output will be pretty large. It's probably best if you just email it to me (daniel@rethinkdb.com)."
