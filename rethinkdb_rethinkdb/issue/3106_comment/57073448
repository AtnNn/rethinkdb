      "We could do two things to provide a better experience here\r\n\r\nBump the magic number since in this case we mapped a previous command (`[...]`) to a new term.\r\n\r\nOr we could provide a better error message? Since we just add new terms, if a term is not found, it's reasonable to suggest the user to update the server (or downgrade their driver)."
