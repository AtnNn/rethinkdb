      "@jprichardson, 1GB is a bit low for Rethink -- we typically recommend 2GB of RAM at a minimum. One thing you can do is lower the cache size when creating the table (http://rethinkdb.com/api/#js:manipulating_tables-table_create). It's currently 1GB by default, which means the system will run out of RAM for largish tables. (We're in the process of changing this behavior to automatically account for the amount of RAM in the machine, but unfortunately for now you have to change the cache size manually).\r\n\r\nIf you change it to ~100MB or so, I suspect the memory problem will go away."
