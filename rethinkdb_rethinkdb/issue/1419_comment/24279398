      "This behavior is somewhat expected on a machine with only 1GB of ram. By default each table will allocate itself 4 caches each of size 1GB. Release 1.10 should address this since it will change the way we do cache quotas to address exactly this problem but until then I'd recommend you decrease the cache size of your tables. (You can set the cache size on table creation from within the webUI or from the drivers.)"
