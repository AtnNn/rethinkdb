        "Is there a way to figure out the optional arguments for ```run()``` are being passed and processed by the server successfully? For example ```r.table('marvel').run(conn, {noreply: true}, function (err, cursor) {...});``` ? I am using lua drivers from https://github.com/grandquista/Lua-ReQL which is perfectly working, but I need to know if the optargs are really being passed to the server and parsed? Is there something equivalent to log all queries and their params?"
