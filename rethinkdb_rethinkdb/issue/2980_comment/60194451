      "I have a prototype of this in `tim/2980`. \r\n\r\n benchmarked it under the following conditions: I ran two servers on my local machine. I created 100 tables with 1000 documents each, and configured each one with two shards and two replicas. Under these conditions `r.table_status()` takes about 2 seconds, or about 20 ms per table, when not under load. During a backfill it takes about twice as long.\r\n\r\nBased on this I think we can keep it in `table_status`, but we should parallelize it; i.e. we should run 10 distribution queries at a time."
