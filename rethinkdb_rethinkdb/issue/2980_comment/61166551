      "I think we should just change the name of the field (e.g. `approx_doc_counts`) to make this clear. \r\nHaving strings rather than numeric values feels pretty weird, and makes it more challenging to parse.\r\n\r\nIt might also make sense to make it more obvious that these numbers are per shard. The best I can come up with right now is `approx_shard_distribution`, but that's not quite good enough."
