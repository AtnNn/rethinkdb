      "The PageTest assumes that its write transactions are not going to get throttled.  I might add a flag to the page_txn_t constructor that lets it force-acquire the throttling semaphore (which would either (a) also cause preceding transactions to force-acquire the throttling semaphore, or (b) cause preceding transactions on the same cache_conn_t to force-acquire the throttling semaphore).  Or, I might decouple the throttler from the page_cache_t a bit."
