      "Just ran some tests on the server with `--cache-size 0`, and it appears this doesn't cause hangs in normal operation.  I ran an insert workload across multiple clients while throwing in some sindex post-construction.  Performance dipped fairly quickly (because with no cache, the throttler only allows one write through at a time), but no failures or hangs.  The only slightly perturbing behavior was that sindex creation didn't finish until I stopped the write workload for a couple seconds, but that isn't exactly unexpected.\r\n\r\nThe PageTest unittests appear to make some assumptions about cache throttling that are no longer true (assumptions that the rest of the code doesn't make), so I think the test needs to be updated."
