      "Hi @ntquyen -- I don't think it's possible to upgrade with 0 downtime right now.  (@danielmewes, am I right about this?)  I think the best thing to do is to take down all your nodes at once and bring up the new version as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nClosing since this isn't a bug, but feel free to continue asking questions here."
