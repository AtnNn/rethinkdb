      "Hi @shengc, are any writes happening to the table while the read is running? Could transactions be inserted or deleted concurrently?\r\n\r\nAlso to make sure I understand correctly: do entries get skipped within a *single* run of this query? Or do the skips happen only *between* runs, if you have to start another query with a new offset?"
