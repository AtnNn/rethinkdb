      "This bit was written wrongly, partially because there seems to have been some mis-understanding about how YAML handles `null`/`nil`/`None`. It is [documented here](http://yaml.org/type/null.html), but the summary is that in YAML any of these is translated into `None` in Python from YAML:\r\n```\r\n  # empty\r\n~\r\nnull\r\nNull\r\nNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe then have code that should take this `None` value, and replace it with the appropriate value. However, that code was looking for the string `null` in Ruby and Python, and in JavaScript was trying to translate it to `None`. We mostly go by falling through holes.\r\n\r\nI have already fixed the code in `test-runner`, but now have to fix all the myriad variations in the YAML files."
