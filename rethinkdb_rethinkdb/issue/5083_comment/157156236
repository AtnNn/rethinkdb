      "It's very likely that the original index rebuild failure was caused by the table still being backfilling.\r\n\r\nI think we should put a `table.wait()` into the index rebuild script. Probably as a separate step with a message \"Waiting for tables to become ready\" or something, in case the wait takes a while?\r\n@Tryneus any thoughts on that?"
