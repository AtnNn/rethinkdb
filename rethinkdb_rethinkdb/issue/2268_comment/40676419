      "> It however fails on `null`\r\n\r\nDo you mean that `x.merge(null) -> null`? I'm not sure why we do it this way, but it seems like a bug. I think that `x.merge(null)` should return `x`. Would that fix the problem?\r\n\r\nFor the branch, you can do this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nquery.do(function (q) {\r\n  return r.branch(q.eq(null), null, q);\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat only works if the query is an object because we currently don't allow passing streams (since there are lots of open questions there). But once we allow that, you'll be able to use the same `do` syntax.\r\n\r\nOr am I misunderstanding something?"
