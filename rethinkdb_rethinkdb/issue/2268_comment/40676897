      "You could add `.default` to deal with `null.merge(x)` erroring. Would that fix the problem?\r\n\r\nI feel a bit less comfortable with `null.merge(x)` returning `null`, that seems a bit too soft to me. But if you think it's really useful and want that behavior, could you open an issue for it so we can debate it as a ReQL proposal? (it's not immediately obvious to me that defining `merge` like that is a bad idea)"
