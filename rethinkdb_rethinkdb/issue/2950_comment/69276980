      "So now that we have UTF-8 validation (which is easy) this is possible.  There's an issue that comes up with this, which is as follows:\r\n* I issue `r.http('http://capcom.co.jp/')`.\r\n* in the headers, it advertises itself as `Content-Type: text/html` with no encoding given.  In HTML 4, the default character set is ISO 8859-1.  In HTML 5 the default character set is UTF-8.  In both cases, the `Content-Type` can be further clarified in a `<meta>` field in the `<head>` section of the HTML.  We can't deal with this unless we are actually trying to parse the HTML; we have to assume UTF-8 and if it doesn't work give a binary, which is fine.\r\n* A different sort of failure comes from `r.http('http://timecube.com')` which advertises itself as, again, `Content-Type: text/html` with no encoding given but is actually (as clarified from the `<meta>` field in the `<head>` section ISO 8859-1 (mostly literal encoding of non-breaking spaces).  In this case, `r.http` should probably give a binary."
