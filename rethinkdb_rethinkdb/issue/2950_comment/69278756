      "ISO 8859-1 and UTF-8 are identical in the 7-bit zone that is ASCII.  It is possible to accidentally issue a sequence of 8859-1 characters that happen to correspond to valid UTF-8 sequences; \"\234t\233\" in UTF-8 has the same byte sequence as \"\195\170t\195\169\" in ISO 8859-1, although that particular character sequence is pretty goofy.\r\n\r\nIn practice in actual documents the chance of accidentally making a document in 8859-1 that is semantically meaningful and also legal UTF-8 is minimal, I would guess sub 0.01%."
