      "So the current state is that if I try to load a web page that isn't UTF-8 but is a `text/*` format, it will force it to a string and that string may be invalid.  If I `r.http` a URL that purports to be JSON but is actually not encoded in UTF-8, that will fail with a poor error message and quote the (invalid) string in the reply, which is kinda bad.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes has proposed that we always give binaries by default, particularly because parsing the HTML `<head>` so that we can know what encoding the body uses is really not trivial.  I am not so sure about this, because a) we lose all the header information when we do that, particularly the `Content-Type` which is important b) users may have grown to expect strings from `r.http` and this may be a bit of a surprise to them.\r\n\r\nWhen we have the improved UTF-8 parser needed for #2518 we can properly 'escape' the invalid body, which is a separate issue.\r\n\r\nPossibly we should add a new data type that includes all the headers as well, as those could be useful.  But that may not be a good idea to run from `r.http`, maybe call it something else.  ICU does have methods for charset conversion."
