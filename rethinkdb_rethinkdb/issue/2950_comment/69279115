      "More precisely, my suggestion is to\r\n* Make the default return format for `r.http` `binary`\r\n* Keep automatically parsing things where the `Content-Type` is one of the JSON types\r\n* If the user specified `{result_format: \"test\"}`, return a string but fail if it's not valid UTF-8\r\n* Allow `r.json` to accept `binary` data, so that a user can still easily wrap an `r.json` around the `r.http`.\r\n\r\nI'm opposed to returning a string by default and falling back to `binary` only if the string isn't valid UTF-8 because user's will than have to handle two different cases in their queries which are going to depend on the contents of the retrieved data."
