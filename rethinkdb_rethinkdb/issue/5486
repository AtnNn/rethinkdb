        "I have a question, I am planning on using rethinkdb in large scale. Currently in mongo I have a lot of collections. E.g. think of it as ~5 collections per user. In rethinkdb should I go for tables or nest the data inside one collection as this is also possible. \r\n\r\nThink of it as if it is large scale, think about the read/write performance and also the realtime changes.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"
