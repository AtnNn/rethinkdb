        "I think backfilling on rotational drives has become somewhat slow in 1.12. I noticed this especially when backfilling a large number of small documents.\n\nWhen I introduced `chunk_processing_semaphore` (`src/clustering/immediate_consistency/branch`) to throttle backfilling, I set it to a rather conservative limit of 1 concurrently processed backfill chunks.\nThe main benefit of a small value is a low performance impact of backfills on other queries.\n\nWe have introduced a limit on the number of concurrent backfills since then, and it probably makes sense to re-evaluate the choice for this limit and to optimize it for the best compromise between backfill throughput and limiting the performance impact of backfilling.\n"
