      "Thank you for the writeup @deontologician !\r\n\r\nThere is another option 1C:\r\nC. Update and replace (and delete) would support \"keys\", but we filter out trivial changes. Only keys of inserted or deleted documents would be returned.\r\n\r\nMy preferences are either 1C or 1A.\r\n\r\nI think it would be weird to have a `generated_keys` optarg that allows for a different set of values in different write terms."
