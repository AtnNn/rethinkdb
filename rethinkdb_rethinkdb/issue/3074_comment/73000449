      "I'd like to make a new proposal: rather than doing anything clever, we just keep things the way they are now, except:\r\n* We rename the `generated_keys` field to `keys`.\r\n* We include keys for all the documents we inserted, whether they were produced by our key generation or by `r.uuid()` (or just hard-coded).\r\n* We don't return keys by default, but we have an optarg to turn them on.  I'd be fine with either `return_keys: true` or `return_changes: 'keys'`.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug, @danielmewes, @deontologician -- how does that sound?"
