      "> On a pure update/replacement changes would be empty if `return_changes == \"keys\"`.\r\n\r\nI think that it would be better to set `new_val` and `old_val` to the same key in case of updates. It's more consistent, less confusing, and lets you trivially figure out which precise records were updated."
