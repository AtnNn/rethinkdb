      "One other quick question: if we allow `return_changes = \"keys\"` on `update` and `replace`, which I think we should for consistency reasons, would we always return `old_val = null` and `new_val = null` (or empty array, not sure what we currently return if nothing changed)? Or should we still return the primary keys of all changed documents in `new_val` and possibly `old_val` as well, even though the primary key hasn't changed?\r\n"
