      "I'm not sure if the `keys`/`generated_keys` field should have the `{error: }` variant. I assumed it would only contain keys of documents that were actually inserted.\r\n\r\nHowever I'm warming up to the idea of just having it be a reduced `return_changes` variant. In that case it should behave exactly like `return_changes`, except that it would only return the primary keys of the documents rather than their full contents. It should also have an `\"always\"` option in that case."
