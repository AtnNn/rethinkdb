      "This was discussed further up, but missing in the latest proposal: We should also support the `return_keys` option with `replace` (compare https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5752 ).\r\n\r\nFor both `insert` with the new conflict-resolution function option as well as for `replace`, there is the question of whether the `keys` result field should include keys of all modified documents or only of inserted documents. If it only contains inserted documents, I think we might want to rename it to `inserted_keys`. Though at that point I'm thinking that we should also have `replaced_keys` and `deleted_keys` fields... which makes @deontologician 's idea of having a `return_changes` \"light\"  that returns a list of `{old_key: ..., new_key: ...}` pairs sound like the more consistent option in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI think we might need to re-discuss this."
