      "The issue of not having an error document is that we can't tell which value in an insert failed. We don't know the keys yet, so the only way to determine which one failed is the offset in the insert batch. If we are silent on error, the rest of the inserted keys all correspond to the wrong documents.\r\n\r\nEdit: alternately, you can of course requery all of the successful ids and use process of elimination based on some other info you know about in the documents"
