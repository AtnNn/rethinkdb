      "Since we disable `SSLv2`, `SSLv3`, `TLSv1`, and `TLSv1.1` on the server side, as well as enforcing `SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE`, there's no strict need to disallow this on the client side.\r\n\r\nI'd like to keep the `check_hostname` and have it on by default, but allow the user to disable it if needed for the reasons @danielmewes mentioned."
