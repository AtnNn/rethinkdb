      "@VeXocide: for clarity, this would not be something that the user would be disabling, except by their (OS's) choice of Python version. And it is not something we probably would be advertising (except maybe in documentation).\r\n\r\nAnd again, for clarity, even if we are disallowing those options on the server, if they are options on the client then there is a chance for someone to man-in-the-middle if we go with options 2 or 3.\r\n\r\nAll that being said I am still for option 3. Unless anyone disagrees, I will go with that option."
