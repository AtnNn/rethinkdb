      "I don't think `check_hostname` is very important for us, since most users will use their own private certificate for verifying the server certificate, rather than using a certificate signed by a public CA.\r\n\r\nEspecially if the server certificate is self-signed, an attacker who gets access to the matching private key could sign their own certificates for arbitrary host names anyway.\r\n\r\nI think we also don't verify the hostname in the other drivers, though I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nDisallowing `SSLv2` and `SSLv3` on the other hand sounds like a good idea.\r\n\r\nI think that it's probably fine to go for option 3 and not set these options if `SSLContext` is not available. I'd like to hear @VeXocide's opinion though."
