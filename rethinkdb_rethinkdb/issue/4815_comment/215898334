      "This is in `next` with 79b93635 and `v2.3.x` with d79df259. I should note that I did not put in code to reuse `SSLContext` as I could not see a simple way of making sure that we were being called with the same certs bundle and on the same host in a reasonable manner. At some point that would be good to get in, but would probably have to distinguish `reconnect` from new `connect` calls."
