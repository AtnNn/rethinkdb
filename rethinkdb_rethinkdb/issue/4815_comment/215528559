      "@larkost I agree with your assessment. I think option 3 is the most reasonable compromise we can pick here.\r\n\r\nThere's a fourth option as well, that is a bit more conservative: We add a way for the user to disable `check_hostname`, and I agree with @VeXocide that this would be useful in general. Then if `SSLContext` doesn't exist and `check_hostname` is not explicitly disabled by the user, we fail and tell the user to disable the `check_hostname` option or use a newer version of Python.\r\n\r\nI'm undecided on whether I prefer 3 or 4. I think 4 would be slightly better, but is also slightly more work."
