      "@teslan RethinkDB is awesome. I believe you need to research what a scam is. This is more like reverse scam, we gained not lost. RethinkDB created millions of dollars worth of value and people used this product for free to make money out of their start-ups / projects / etc. I'm look forward to seeing this thrive as a self-sustained open source project."
