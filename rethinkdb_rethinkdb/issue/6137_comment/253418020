      "I think best line of strategy is identify what organisations would be looking to continue the development open source and what their licensing preference is and governance model is. Prematurely deciding these will be the death of the project.\r\n\r\nAlso as part of the liquidation the current company can try sell the code base and brand name to another company who would be willing to maintain the project as open source. If it solely on company involve this might not work well unless it has deep pockets and a strong commitment. If you cannot find such company best is look for a group of companies.\r\n\r\nAlso more parties participating in the governance like ASF then more chances are the project will not be orphaned. So what is proposed would attract the widest number of contributors from entities can take this forward. When going to ASF best is have a consortium of companies who would pledge to continue the work. What you have to figure out is who will pledge to continue the work and who you can make it work for the companies who pledge to continue the project."
