      "SPI in my understanding does provide similar services to SFC, to  a number of orgs: http://www.spi-inc.org/projects/\r\n\r\nWe've been affiliated them for haskell.org for some years. They only provide the 501(c)3 umbrella and some basic services (and not necessarily very rapidly, to be honest, but that's due to their own resource constraints), but have been pretty decent at doing what they're supposed to, and its been much appreciated. I can't speak to the tradeoffs between them and the SFC very well, but they're worth mentioning, I suppose."
