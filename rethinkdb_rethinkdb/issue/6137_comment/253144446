      "@kofalt Thanls for the client license reference, raised a PR to note it in the package.json for the js/npm version, so it would show up on npm.\r\n\r\nI have mixed feelings as to AGPL though, while I appreciate the protections of agpl, I'm not sure that the defense against a customized SaaSified version of RethinkDB really has nearly as much merit if the company behind the project is shutting down anyway.  GPL (without the A) has been working fine for MySQL/MariaDB adoption.  So maybe a straight reduction to GPL 2 or 3 might be okay...\r\n\r\nEither way, I have no plans to customize the codebase, or start a SaaS around the product... just being understanding of some of the concerns of others."
