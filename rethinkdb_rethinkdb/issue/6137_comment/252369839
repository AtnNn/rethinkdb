      "@brianm This is super helpful - I hope the rethinkdb folks read it. I think the choice is between these two models indeed:\r\n\r\n- an independent org (through LF, Conservancy or otherwise) that hires and employs developers but also works with corporate partners + individual contributors\r\n- a project within an established structure like Apache that works with contributors of all stripes but does not itself hire developers.\r\n\r\nWhich of these two models is the right one likely depends on whether there is a champion within the current contributor community who is able to drive the first one. Sustainably paying FTEs through a non-profit is hard as those who've pushed this model in the infrastructure space (e.g., MariaDB) can attest. There's arguably higher risk / higher reward here.\r\n\r\nIf the org goes for the second approach, I would recommend engaging a contractor to shepherd the process, at least for Apache which is fairly complex. I can suggest a few folks who I think could take this on, and others might too. But the licensing piece would have to be cleared up before anything else."
