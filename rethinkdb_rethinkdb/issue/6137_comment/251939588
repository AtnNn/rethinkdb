      "Linux Foundation sounds nice, not sure about Apache. They already have a lot of databases ([Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/), [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/)) - which makes me unsure about how much time will be actually spent on continuing developing RethinkDB. Also loads of their projects who also had a decent amount of users started getting unmaintained for a few years or still are (e.g. [Shindig](https://shindig.apache.org/) or [Archiva](https://archiva.apache.org/)). Maybe even @stripe could support RethinkDB as they [contribute a lot](https://stripe.com/open-source) to Open Source already."
