      "A fundamental difference between Linux Foundation (LF) foundations (`a la the Node.js Foundation and CNCF) and the Apache Software Foundation is the unit of participation at the foundation level. The LF is geared for pay-to-play corporate running of the foundation, which can be, and usually is, totally separate from the technical operation of projects therein. The ASF is business friendly but always explicitly composed of the individuals who contribute, not the corporations. Those individuals may be paid to work on the project, but control of the project and foundation is to the individual person.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be able to have the _foundation_ employee people to work on the project, go with the LF (possibly via CNCF, but I am not involved in the CNCF so I don't know if it is set up to allow for that). \r\n\r\nTo the comment that the ASF has databases already, so it is unclear \"how much time will be actually spent on continuing developing RethinkDB\" -- the ASF doesn't devote people to working on projects, it provides a fairly well-proven governance model geared towards long-term viability of projects. It doesn't work well for all projects, and is no guarantee of the long-term viability, but has a good track record overall. That is about it :-)\r\n\r\nLF foundations are much more flexible in how things work. The LF foundation package provides a framework for how things can work, legal and administrative assistance, and then basically lets the foundation go do its thing. If you want your own foundation and are prepared to drum up corporate sponsor/members, the LF is WAY easier than forming a new foundation from scratch and is about the best way to go. You will need to develop your own governance model, but if you want your own governance model, you'll need that anyway!\r\n\r\nI am not familiar with the model set up by the CNCF (an LF foundation), so cannot compare it."
