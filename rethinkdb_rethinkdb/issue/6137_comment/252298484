      "Speaking personally, but as someone who is a member of the [CNCF Technical Oversight Committee](https://cncf.io/about/technical-oversight-committee), I would love to see RethinkDB in the CNCF -- and I think it would be a great fit.  I do think that the AGPL may pose an obstacle, so it would be helpful to know if relicensing (to Apache 2) would be considered on the table -- but even if that were not an option, I would love to try to find a way for RethinkDB to be a CNCF project!"
