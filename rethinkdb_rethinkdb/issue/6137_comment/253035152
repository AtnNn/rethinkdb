      "My 2 cents, since there's a lot of community input here: I would greatly prefer RDB remain AGPL.\r\n\r\nIt would be counter-productive to elaborate: I really, **really** don't want to derail this thread into a debate about licensing merits. Suffice it to say that I'm read into the subject & familiar with the ramifications :smile: \r\n\r\nCritically, note that the drivers are [already Apache licensed](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/COPYRIGHT), and Slava has a [relevant blurb](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rethinkdb/g5UEck3sqMs/ZDBsiZ0tUdAJ) on this also."
