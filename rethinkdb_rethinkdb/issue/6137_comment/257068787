      "> If RethinkDB ever was an open source project then now there would be no questions about need for new licensing nor its continuity as an open source project\r\n\r\nYou're confusing several different issues.\r\n\r\nAGPL confuses people (including lawyers) - doesn't mean it an actual problem. The intent is fairly clear but people get lost and hung-up in the technicalities. It's hard to imagine that the license is the reason for Rethink's failure as a business. Either way it doesn't mean the now defunct business was a scam.\r\n\r\nWhat is true whoever is given it has failed and there's obviously support from users at least for a move to a more holistic open source approach to the IP that's there a more permissive license might help in the long run (and there's always going to be people who would say it might have helped 6 months ago).\r\n\r\nNot for nothing but as what appears to be a non-contributer on a rant session I'd strongly question your motives. Whatever - there's useful technology there and people are trying to res it; ranting isn't useful to any of it."
