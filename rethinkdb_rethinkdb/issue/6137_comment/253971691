      "Notwithstanding the fact that I could have used a better word nor the fact that none of this was likely done intentionally, it mind as well have been a scam because the final results are the same. Too many people started using it because of its \"open source\" label, without knowing what that really meant. I would expect so called open source projects, especially the funded commercial ones, to leverage and  incorporate their open source community into the way that they do business.  \r\n\r\nHad any of that been done, today there would already be a community. There would be no need to be going back to square one and be talking about different types of licenses. The whole thing would have been less of an all-or-nothing proposition because there would already be at least some members whose food on the table comes from different companies, instead of everyone being dependent on a single source. \r\n\r\nThe whole thing unraveled most likely because of difficulties in selling software licenses and/or services.  Instead of building software to sell, more and more companies are building software for themselves to use. RethinkDB as a service, would have made a fantastic open source alternative to Firebase. @ha1331, I would bet that you already knew all of that ;)"
