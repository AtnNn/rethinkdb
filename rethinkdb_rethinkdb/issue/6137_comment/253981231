      "> Notwithstanding the fact that I could have used a better word nor the fact that none of this was likely done intentionally, it mind as well have been a scam because the final results are the same. Too many people started using it because of its \"open source\" label, without knowing what that really meant. I would expect so called open source projects, especially the funded commercial ones, to leverage and incorporate their open source community into the way that they do business.\r\n\r\nYou could have used a better word? Which one? You talk about open source, with the intensity of thousand suns, but to you it seems to not mean what you can do with the code base. It actually has very little to do with the code. To you it seems to be this idea of everything being there, people doing stuff for free, infinite funding, bunch of that funding is being pushed to make sure the project lives on. Not only  even that, the point you are making is, it's a scam because after a month from the announcement of the company shutting down, people are not pushing for the next release and the army of community welfare workers are not promising you the moon and the skies. You make absolutely no sense at all. \r\n\r\nI wonder if you even used RethinkDB or is this just another one of them things you have hard time keeping up with? I mean it's pretty bold to be saying there is no community around RethinkDB. \r\n\r\n> Had any of that been done, today there would already be a community. There would be no need to be going back to square one and be talking about different types of licenses. The whole thing would have been less of an all-or-nothing proposition because there would already be at least some members whose food on the table comes from different companies, instead of everyone being dependent on a single source.\r\n> \r\n> The whole thing unraveled most likely because of difficulties in selling software licenses and/or services. Instead of building software to sell, more and more companies are building software for themselves to use. RethinkDB as a service, would have made a fantastic open source alternative to Firebase. @ha1331, I would bet that you already knew all of that ;)\r\n\r\nYou sir, are a meanie. People here are trying their best to sort out what license to switch to, what needs to happen before that, what foundation to go under, how to organize everything that was done by the people of the defunct company, so pretty much everything. What is your input in the matter? Well, scam, not proper open source, if you would have walked the Teslan road, people wouldn't have to endure any of this, seeing how you would have done it properly. That is whole new level of ... something that starts with an A and rhymes with a black hole. Out of respect to the community formed around these products, I'm just going to leave it at this. Live long and prosper brother @teslan ."
