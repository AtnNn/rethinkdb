      "Perhaps there's value in @mglukhovsky and @coffeemug commenting on the possibilities of changing the license from AGPL to something more liberal? It'd be really helpful to understand the potential downsides, since we've been hearing quite a bit about the upsides during the past few days.\r\n\r\nI think from the community's perspective (especially those still using the software), there is a real sense of danger that rethinkdb might not be viable 1-2 years down the road, especially if the right support isn't garnered while there's a ton of attention on the product.\r\n\r\nAs a founder, there's something to be said about momentum. Sometimes it's this intangible thing that gets lost during times of volatility, yet it is a fiercely important component of success that is hard to maintain and 10x harder to restart after it is lost -- not something to be taken for granted. If there are orgs that can shepherd rethinkdb into a sustainable place again without losing too much momentum, that'd be huge for both the legacy of the rethinkdb team, as well as the confidence of all those that use and love this beautiful piece of software. If the license is identified as a blocker, let us know the specific reasons why a change isn't the immediate consideration here."
