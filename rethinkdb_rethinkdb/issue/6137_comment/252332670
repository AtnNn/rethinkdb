      "As an addendum to what a lot of people have mentioned regarding AGPL for the server... it would be nice to see something like MIT or ISC for the client libraries.  Right now, the npm module for rethinkdb doesn't list any license.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, it seems to be that a push towards an Apache license may be for the best as to the server regarding being able to support it in a foundational org.  I think that @bcantrill is correct in that it would be a good fit within the CNCF."
