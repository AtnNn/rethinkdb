      "> Yet another open-source scam?\r\n> \r\n> This whole incident is an excellent illustration of how much scam or scam-like activity is going on within open source. OK, I just read what I wrote and it hurts to read what I just wrote, so then let me try to explain why I would inflict so much pain onto myself and likely others.\r\n>\r\n> \r\n> If RethinkDB ever was an open source project then now there would be no questions about need for new licensing nor its continuity as an open source project. All of that would have already been in place. There are too many \"open source\" projects [like this] that pretend to be open source but are first and foremost geared towards making a profit for those that have invested in it. There is nothing wrong with making a profit and since there has never been anything like a free lunch, profits must be made because someone must end up paying for it all.\r\n\r\n@teslan Hurts me too, but I suspect for different reasons. I find it hard to follow the reasoning, at all. I wonder if you actually mean something else, Could you explain how is rethinkdb not open source or less now than it used to be? How have you or anyone else been scammed? Did you think it was under different license than AGPL? Do you feel betrayed because it was? Or do you think AGPL is not a valid open source license? \r\n\r\nRethink has been AGPL for as long as I know, Still is. So what is the issue you would like to fix or prefer to have been fixed before the company shut down? Not going to touch the \"there would be no questions about need for new licensing\" part, but I'm curious to know how could have they ensured that there will be no questions about it's continuity as an open source project? Do tell if you have figured that out. I suspect it's too late for these products, but I bet there are ton of people building products that could use your advice. So, what would you have had in place, have you been mr RethinkDB and had the reigns?\r\n\r\n> However, the accompanying commercial business plans must be based on added service that are on top of a thriving open source community. Those add-on services must not be replacements for at least basic admin tools nor for poor documentation, which too often is lacking because of the add-on services. If those add-on services can not deliver added value, in form of better quality and/or compressed development timelines because more qualified experts would be doing the work then there is no add-on value to speak of\r\n> \r\n> I have been personally struggling (at 55+++) to learn and keep up, navigating through all of these web development mine fields and a web development toolbox whose contents are just about totally replaced every year or two. Nevertheless, even I feel that I could come up with multiple ways in which I could make a profit, only if these tools would settle down a bit. In fact, are we all not here because we feel that we can do the same thing? So, how is it that those who were running RethinkDB as a business, with all that inside info and those $12 MILLION raised, that they were unable to direct a tiny portion of all of those resources into ensuring a sustained self-existence?\r\n\r\nWhat was the point of all the rest? You're 55 and have hard time keeping up with bunch of stuff, but you know how other people should have done bunch of stuff or at least how they shouldn't have done it? How is this relevant, at all, to any of the discussion happening on the topic, which is, by the way: \"Evaluate options for project stewardship, non-profit\"? \r\n\r\nYou make it sound like 12 MILLION is indicative of something, like its some huge amount of money and surely they should have had enough to use on stuff like ensuring the sustained self-existence. How would have that worked, they raise this money to build a business, people invested in it so they might some day make profit, but people behind RethinkDB the company should have siphoned some of that invested money to... what? Some foundation that never existed, just to make sure that if it goes bad, bunch of that investors money is there sitting and waiting for the rainy day? Surely you can't mean anything like that?\r\n\r\nI hope I don't come out as being terribly salty. Tho I do take offence in bunch of < redacted > when I personally feel like I got to use these products for free, enjoyed using them and hoped people behind said product \"make it\". Then when it didn't go like planned, these people had to shut down a company and kind of failed at something they used 7 years to build. After this, while we talk < redacted >, same bunch of people work to ensure these products have a future as a community driven effort. Even that's not enough, surely all this is just a scam, let's just call captain hindsight and talk bunch of nonsense about the nature of true open source... for reals mate?\r\n> \r\n> Take care and shut the lights out behind you.\r\n\r\n![captain-hindsight](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8921895/19394676/f5245682-9242-11e6-9dab-04718ab4f4db.jpg)\r\n"
