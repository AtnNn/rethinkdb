      "Yet another open-source scam?\r\n\r\nThis whole incident is an excellent illustration of how much scam or scam-like activity is going on within open source. OK, I just read what I wrote and it hurts to read what I just wrote, so then let me try to explain why I would inflict so much pain onto myself and likely others.\r\n\r\nIf RethinkDB ever was an open source project then now there would be no questions about need for new licensing nor its continuity as an open source project. All of that would have already been in place. There are too many \"open source\" projects [like this] that pretend to be open source but are first and foremost geared towards making a profit for those that have invested in it. There is nothing wrong with making a profit and since there has never been anything like a free lunch, profits must be made because someone must end up paying for it all.\r\n\r\nHowever, the accompanying commercial business plans must be based on added service that are on top of a thriving open source community. Those add-on services must not be replacements for at least basic admin tools nor for poor documentation, which too often is lacking because of the add-on services. If those add-on services can not deliver added value, in form of better quality and/or compressed development timelines because more qualified experts would be doing the work then there is no add-on value to speak of.\r\n\r\nI have been personally struggling (at 55+++) to learn and keep up, navigating through all of these web development mine fields and a web development toolbox whose contents are just about totally replaced every year or two. Nevertheless, even I feel that I could come up with multiple ways in which I could make a profit, only if these tools would settle down a bit. In fact, are we all not here because we feel that we can do the same thing? So, how is it that those who were running RethinkDB as a business, with all that inside info and those $12 MILLION raised, that they were unable to direct a tiny portion of all of those resources into ensuring a sustained self-existence?\r\n\r\nTake care and shut the lights out behind you."
