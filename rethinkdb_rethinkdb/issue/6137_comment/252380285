      "A few comments from a long-time ASF Member:\r\n\r\n- The openZipkin community is considering a move to a foundation right now as well, and there are a few gems of useful information for RethinkDB in there:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/openzipkin.github.io/issues/51\r\n\r\nmichaelsembwever and myself have some good data there about Apache; caniszczyk provides some good data about CNCF at the LF.\r\n\r\n- The ASF only uses the Apache license v2.0.  So you'd need to decide ahead of time if you were able and willing to relicense to Apache before making a proposal to the Apache Incubator.\r\n\r\n- If you have some coherent community organization, but want the minimal overhead and restrictions, then consider SPI or the Software Freedom Conservancy.  They don't offer the community and infrastructure support that CNCF or ASF would offer, but they provide a legal place to hang your hat and do fundraising - and own your trademarks - with very broad ability to decide how you run your own project governance.\r\n\r\nThe real question is: are there enough people active in the community to spend at least a little time **working together** to document and organize the move to a new home?  That's along with showing that there's still a vibrant developer community interested in continuing to work on the code.\r\n\r\nVarious LF Collaborative Projects (like CNCF) and the ASF have plenty of mentors who do have experience with how our foundations work, so please do reach out to us if you have questions.\r\n\r\n- Shane"
