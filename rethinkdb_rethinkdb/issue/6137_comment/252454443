      "> However, the accompanying commercial business plans must be based on added service that are on top of a thriving open source community. Those add-on services must not be replacements for at least basic admin tools nor for poor documentation, which too often is lacking because of the add-on services. If those add-on services can not deliver added value, in form of better quality and/or compressed development timelines because more qualified experts would be doing the work then there is no add-on value to speak of.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB never goes a Fremium model with limiting functionality , they give every thing since public version. They openly communicates with the community on every issues , features and decision."
