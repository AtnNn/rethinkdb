      "I think this isn't very useful. I may be running a cluster with two dozen tables, piping my stats feed into a monitoring tool. If a part of the cluster goes offline, I still want to see the stats for the rest of the tables -- I don't want the whole monitoring system to go dark. I think we should fix this as part of the refactor.\r\n\r\nI think we should definitely skip servers that aren't responding and move on. We shouldn't abort, even if none of the servers for a particular table are available.\r\n\r\nThere is a question of whether we should add an entry for inaccessible servers/tables to the `stats` table (to inform the user that we couldn't read the stats for those particular resources). I think we should, but would be interesting to know what @danielmewes @AtnNn @larkost think."
