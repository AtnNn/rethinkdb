      "For the stats table, can't we just contact all connected servers once and have them send us stats for all their tables which we can then merge? Or would that be a big change from the current implementation?\r\n\r\nDoes the non-authorative table metadata have a snapshot of servers for a table that we could use to generate table_server and server entries for missing servers?"
