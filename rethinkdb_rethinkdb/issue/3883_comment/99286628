      "In 2.0 we currently do the following:\r\n* for stats entries that are for a specific server, we generate a document like this:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n{\r\n    \"error\": \"Timed out. Unable to retrieve stats.\" ,\r\n    \"id\": [\r\n        \"server\" ,\r\n        \"ac11075b-0523-4a81-9f1f-583425e1bef9\"\r\n    ] ,\r\n    \"server\": \"starearth_or0\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n    This includes server and table_server documents.\r\n* For documents that are not server-specific (i.e. `table`, `cluster`), we ignore the numbers from the unavailable servers and also don't show any error.\r\n\r\nI think we should keep that behavior if possible.\r\n\r\nI suggest that in `table_config`, we generate a similar document as in case 1 with an `error` field."
