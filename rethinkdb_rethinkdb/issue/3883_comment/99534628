      "My 2\162 is that we definitely should show missing tables as missing (I think there is consensus on that), and if reasonably possible show a guess about what servers are involved. From the admin's perspective knowing that a table is missing is very important, but the next thing I want to know is what server I have to kick to get it back up.\r\n\r\nIf we can't reasonably give that information, then we can't. But that will be a point of frustration."
