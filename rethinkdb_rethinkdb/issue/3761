        "RE2 regular expressions support named groups, but these names are ignored by RethinkDB. currently `r.expr(\"foobar\").match(\"(?P<name>b.)(.)\")` returns\n\n```\n{\n    \"end\": 5 ,\n    \"groups\": [\n        {\n            \"end\": 5 ,\n            \"start\": 3 ,\n            \"str\": \"ba\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"end\": 6 ,\n            \"start\": 5 ,\n            \"str\": \"r\"\n        } \n    ] ,\n    \"start\": 3 ,\n    \"str\": \"ba\"\n}\n```\n\nIt would be nice if the `groups` property was an object instead:\n\n```\n    \"groups\": {\n        \"name\": {\n            \"end\": 5 ,\n            \"start\": 3 ,\n            \"str\": \"ba\"\n        },\n        \"1\": {\n            \"end\": 6 ,\n            \"start\": 5 ,\n            \"str\": \"r\"\n        } \n    }\n```\n\nThis would make dealing with large regular expressions a lot easier.\n"
