      "Er, ignore that comment, I forgot for a second that we don't have range writes even for whole tables.  I think we should rewrite it to `r.table(t).filter(f).update(r.branch(f, u, nil))`, which will be slightly slower than `r.table(t).filter(f).update(u)` but will provide the atomicity guarantee."
