      "> I really don't see a reason not to make the default behavior safe for all selections where it's easy.\r\n\r\n:+1: for fixing places where it's easy for now, and adding `atomic_selection` (or something similar) once we have the time to properly debate it. (Also, if/when we do add `atomic_selection` I'd make `update` error on selections that aren't atomic, unless the user passes `non_atomic=True`)"
