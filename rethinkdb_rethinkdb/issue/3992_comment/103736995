      "I think this proposal is still a bit half baked.\r\n\r\nIf we make `filter.update` atomic on a per-document basis, we should do the same for `getAll.update`, and `getIntersecting.update`.\r\n\r\nWe cannot do it for all commands that return a selection unfortunately, since for example for `orderBy.limit` determining whether a document matches the predicate depends on other documents.\r\n\r\nThe `filter` case is by far the most common, but I agree with @timmaxw that if we special case only filter, that will make our guarantees *more* confusing."
