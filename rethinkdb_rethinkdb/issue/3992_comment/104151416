      "I don't have a strong opinion. I can see both points of view, and they both make sense to me. I wouldn't be opposed to making a subset of our queries behave under tighter semantics under the hood for now, and I wouldn't be opposed to holding off until we can get a more robust solution in place.\r\n\r\nSorry, I'm not a good tie-breaker here. I suppose the fact that I don't feel strongly that we should tighten up the code now means I'm in favor of doing nothing (but I'm not opposed to tightening up the code either)."
