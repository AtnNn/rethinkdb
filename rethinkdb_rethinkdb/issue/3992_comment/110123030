      "I still don't like even just doing `.filter(ATOMIC).update(ATOMIC)`.\r\n\r\nIf we document this, it will become extremely dangerous for users since once they use anything that's non-atomic in the filter (currently using a geo predicate is enough), the atomicity guarantee will silently disappear.\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand we don't document it and don't tell anyone about it, I think it would be better to just explain properly *which* exact operations are atomic and which are not. I think we can do a lot here with improving documentation. We would mention it in the `filter` API documentation, in the `replace` and `update` API documentation and in the FAQ as well as wherever else we mention atomicity. Basically whenever we say \"single document updates are atomic\", we would instead say something along the lines of \"single document updates can be made atomic by using an update function (see ... for details)\"."
