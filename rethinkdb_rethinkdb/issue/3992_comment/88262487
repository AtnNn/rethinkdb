      "`has_fields` is rewritten to a filter, `get_all` is rewritten to a between, and `replace/update/delete` are the same operation underneath.  So we'd have to implement it twice; once for ranges and once for predicates.  I'm not sure about `get_intersecting`, that might be a third implementation."
