        "It seems that backfilling is going slower than it should (at least in some cases).  We should review current backfilling code to make sure it is scaling properly, and that it does not create queues that are too large or suck up too many resources.  This could mean overhauling the flow control and taking another look at disk-backed queue behavior during backfills.\n\nI expect this will be done as a pair-programming exercise with me and @jdoliner.\n"
