      "Could you try running those without `-j 4`?\r\nI haven't been able to reproduce the heartbeat timeouts on newton so far.\r\n\r\nIf the available memory at the start of the rebalance-2-serial-mix test was just 247 MB, it's not unlikely that it went into swap. That would probably have taken the other tests down with it. These tests run three servers, each of which will use up to 100 MB for the cache plus other overheads."
