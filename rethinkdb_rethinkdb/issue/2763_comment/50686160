      "Actually I confused this issue with #2772 already when I wrote about having to test whether it's a regression. I have no way of testing that because I cannot reproduce it on newton even on next.\r\n\r\nI think it only reproduces on Tim's notebook right now, though it could well indicate a wider issue."
