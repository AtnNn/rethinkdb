        "We've got a report where a set of RethinkDB nodes on Google Compute Engine had their i/o throttled (both network and disk as far as I know).\nRather than just becoming slower, the tables in the cluster became completely unavailable, with the log mentioning Raft election timeouts.\n\nWe need to make sure that our Raft implementation is still able to reach a consensus even under high network and disk latency.\n\nMy mostly unjustified suspicion is that once disk latency approaches the Raft election timeout, we never converge. Is that plausible?\n\nPinging @VeXocide \n"
