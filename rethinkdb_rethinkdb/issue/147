        "From @christopherhesse:\n\n```\nkern.log.1:Nov 24 10:25:00 precise64 kernel: [29880.144964] rethinkdb[1735] trap divide error ip:52c87a sp:45e1f10 error:0 in rethinkdb[400000+a32000]\nrethinkdb 1.2.6-0ubuntu1~precise (GCC 4.6.3)\n```\n\nThe instruction pointer evaluates to .../src/clustering/generic/multi_throttling_server.hpp:114, which is:\n\n``` c\nint estimate_qps() {\n  ticks_t time_span = get_ticks() - time_of_last_qps_sample;\n  return running_qps_estimate / 2 + requests_since_last_qps_sample * secs_to_ticks(1) / time_span;\n}\n```\n\nI think it's pretty obvious that we're ending up with a time_span of zero, meaning this function is called twice without ticks being updated.\n\nIt is quite likely related to issues #13 and #15, which were closed because enough information could not be acquired.  I wouldn't put it out of the realm of possibility that there are _other_ places we might divide by zero, but it's on my list to go through and inspect every division.\n"
