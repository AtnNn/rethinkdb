      "Ok, having thought about it and talked to some people, I agree these should return objects. I'm not entirely happy with non-determinism in case of duplicates, but whatever, there are worse things in life to worry about.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should do `argmin` and `argmax` for now (given that 1.12 is like two months late). Users can do `seq.min('a')['b']`; we can add `argmin`-type commands if there is demand.\r\n\r\nMarking as settled.\r\n\r\n"
