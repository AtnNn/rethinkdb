      "> Should we just call them `argmin` and `argmax` and remove min and max? Because that's really what they are, isn't it?\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `argmin` is ambiguous. Does it find the minimum argument and return that argument, or does it find a minimum argument and return that object? :) Same for `minarg`.\r\n\r\nI'd be cool with finding a better name, but I think it would have to be less ambiguous."
