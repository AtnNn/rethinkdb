      "@Sahibul Looks like that's what's going to happen. According to the current proposal they will be called `max()` and `min()`, but actually do what you expect `argmax()` and `argmin()` to do.\r\n\r\nI think it's a good point though. Should we just call them `argmin` and `argmax` and remove `min` and `max`? Because that's really what they are, isn't it?"
