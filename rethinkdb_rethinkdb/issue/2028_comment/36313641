      "I think the intersection of \"least work\" and \"least bad\" is releasing with `min`/`max` returning objects, and maybe adding `minval` and `maxval` or something after release.  So let's just do that.  (This is one of those types of confusion that I don't think it all that bad, because there are two plausible interpretations, and if we picked the one people didn't expect I think they'll quickly understand both the actual interpretation and how to get what they want.)"
