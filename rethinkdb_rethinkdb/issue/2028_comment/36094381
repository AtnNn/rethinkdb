      "I agree that returning `{a: 10, b: 20}` is much more useful than returning `10` (because you can always tack on `['a']`, whereas you couldn't with the latter). I think we should do that.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's more consistent that way with other commands. For example, `order_by('a')` returns objects ordered by `a`, not just ordered fields `a`."
