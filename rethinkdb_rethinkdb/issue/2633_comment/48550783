      "I have analysed the log file. `distcc` is successfully sending files to the build server. The remote compiler runs and fails. `distcc` then discards the error message and tries to rebuild locally. When rebuilding locally, it decides that there are only four available cores and it adopts the behaviour of `-j4`. From what  I can tell, the builds are also failing locally.\r\n\r\nI'll try to find a way to tell it that it can use more than 4 local cores.\r\n\r\nIf you can reproduce this again, can you please re-run `./configure` and `make` with these `distcc` settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure CXX=distcc\r\nDISTCC_FALLBACK=0 DISTCC_HOSTS='chaotica/24 ganondorf/24 lavos/24' make ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will disable local fallback, which should show the error returned by the remote compiler."
