        "This is courtesy of @mglukhovsky's experimentations on GitHub data with RethinkDB. \r\n\r\nThere is an enormous number of APIs that return JSON documents which include URLs linking to more JSON documents. GitHub user/follower/issue data is like that, for example. If I pull a bunch of data from GitHub into RethinkDB, and want to follow those links to get more JSON and put it into Rethink, it's quite annoying since it's gotta go through a client programming language.\r\n\r\nHere's how the `r.wget` command could work:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.wget('http://www.foo.com/jsondoc')\r\n// { http_code: ..., body: ... }\r\n\r\nr.json(r.wget('http://www.foo.com/jsondoc')('body'))\r\n// converts into JSON, I can now operate on it in Rethink\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like a really, really neat idea.\r\n\r\nThere are some implementation questions -- how to deal with blocking, timeouts, large files, etc., but as a developer, I would absolutely *love* this function to play with the data. It would also go a very, very long way to get people to play with RethinkDB. If at all possible, I would accelerate the development of this command because I think it could make an enormous difference for adoption and people's experience. I would consider shipping this pre-1.10."
