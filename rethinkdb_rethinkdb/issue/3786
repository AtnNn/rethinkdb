        "Having read through `net.coffee` in probably way too much detail recently, I accumulated a huge number of nits that might be cleaned up. These are quick to fix, but probably not worth taking on unless (for some reason) we decide against #3771 . If #3771 is accepted, this issue can be closed, since it's very specific to the current js driver, and none of these will apply to rethinkdb-dash\r\n\r\n- [ ] convert direct imports of util functions to use the util.namespace.\r\n- [ ] The connection constructor should use coffeescript default args,\r\n  rather than doing it manually\r\n- [ ] in _processResponse, the conditional should have the error\r\n  condition at the top, and should return early rather than having an\r\n  `else` that's miles away from the `if`\r\n- [ ] Remove the line containing `@_events = @_events || {}`, it's no longer needed (used\r\n  for emulating google EventEmitter previously)\r\n- [ ] Rename the _data method to something less opaque. Also move it closer\r\n  to where it's invoked (_start)\r\n- [ ] Rename b,i in @buffer to byte, offset in @buffer in the\r\n  handshake portion of the code\r\n- [ ] move the default setting code in the constructor for `db` down\r\n  below the other defaults, rather than being right in the middle\r\n- [ ] if cursor? and if feed? arms in _processResponse are identical\r\n  because the two types share and implementation. Either one of two\r\n  things should be done:\r\n  - Change the outstandingCallbacks object to include an `iterable`\r\n    key, and store either a feed or a cursor in it.\r\n  - Collapse the two branches together to remove boilerplate (this is\r\n    suboptimal if the first option is possible because cursors and\r\n    feeds are mutually exclusive in a response as I assume)\r\n- [ ] the else if in _processResponse that checks for a callback `cb?`\r\n  should have an else branch that raises an error if there is no\r\n  callback, but it's not a feed or cursor.\r\n- [ ] Rename the `root` key in outstandingCallbacks to something like `query`, right now the name is confusingly opaque\r\n- [ ] Abstract out the code that handles error responses in\r\n  _processResponse, it's repetitive boilerplate.\r\n- [ ] Also abstract out the code that handles success responses, it's\r\n  boilerplatey as well\r\n- [ ] Make `.cancel` private since it isn't documented publicly.\r\n- [ ] Argument decision trees in close and reconnect have unreachable\r\n  cases, and cases where values are set to something that is known to\r\n  be undefined\r\n- [ ] `reconnect` refers to @rawSocket, which is only present in the\r\n  TCPConnection, not the HTTPConnection. This method should probably\r\n  be moved to the subclass\r\n- [ ] Make the isOpen method private\r\n- [ ] Keep track of whether any queries are ever sent with `noreply:\r\n  true`. If not, don't bother ever running a `noreplyWait` query on\r\n  close.\r\n- [ ] In the `timeout` listener in the TcpConnection constructor,\r\n  instead of just setting @close to false, we should close the\r\n  connection directly. This will raise the 'close' event on the\r\n  socket, and the connections 'close' handler will be run\r\n- [ ] In TcpConnection constructor fix \"timedout\" -> \"timed out\"\r\n- [ ] Uh, why is the `@_url` variable only stored once a connection is\r\n  successfully created? The url never changes, so this is useless to\r\n  do so late.\r\n- [ ] In httpConnection.cancel, we null out @_url. This seems pointless.\r\n- [ ] httpConnection.close is completely redundant. The superclass calls cancel.\r\n- [ ] split out encodeURI(data).split into its own variable, making it\r\n  clear the reasoning is for unicode\r\n- [ ] in r.connect, create_connection needs to be inlined. there's no\r\n  reason for it to be a function.\r\n- [ ] wrappedCb in r.connect is redundant. Both TcpConnection and\r\n  HttpConnection return promises, so we can just chain the callback\r\n  onto the promise from them instead of creating a new promise\r\n- [ ] Remove the handler for the `timeout` event on `@rawSocket` in `TcpConnection`. It's dead code per #3768 "
