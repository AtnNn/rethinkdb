      "Assigning @mlucy.\r\n\r\nI took a very quick look at the core file, and it looks like the virtual `active()` method is resolved to address 0x1, which would suggest that the `range_sub_t` was in the middle of being either destructed or constructed.\r\nAt the same time it looks like we were holding a read lock on the `range_subs_lock` though, which I think should stop that from happening (I checked that the read signal was actually pulsed on the `rwlock_in_line_t`)."
