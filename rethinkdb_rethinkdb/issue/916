(logging to `/srv/rethinkdb_data/log_file')\n```\n\nHowever, the log file was empty and the init.d file returned no further errors. After a bit of digging, I discovered that the directory where the conf file told rethinkdb to put the .pid file didn't have correct permissions. Once I fixed the permissions, everything worked like a charm.\n\nWe should fix the init.d script to report an error if permissions are incorrect.\n"
