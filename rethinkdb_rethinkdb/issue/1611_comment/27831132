      "Ok, I ran some preliminary tests. Here are timing results on a table of 10,000 documents (in seconds):\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntime_it(r.table('foo').map(lambda x: 1).reduce(lambda x, y: x + y), profile=False)\r\n# => 0.109\r\ntime_it(r.table('foo').map(lambda x: 1).reduce(lambda x, y: x + y), profile=True)\r\n# => 0.11\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like the profiler isn't too expensive, at least on simple operations. I'll run more tests on joins and such. I still feel uncomfortable with running the profiler by default in the Data Explorer, particularly because of issues like #1613 (and potential others we didn't catch yet). It also feels like profiling should be a different flow (I can't quite explain why -- perhaps because nobody else runs a profiler by default?). I'll sleep on it and see if I can get my mind to come around."
