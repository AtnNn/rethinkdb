      "> IT\"S TRIVIAL TO EXTEND SAMPLERS TO THIS USE CASE\r\n\r\nIf you can extend the sampler to fix #1613 for the release and can be reasonably confident that we won't run into other issues like this, then I remove my objection.\r\n\r\n> You're wasting your time (and my time) worrying about this.\r\n\r\nI don't think I'm wasting time. The data explorer is a very visible feature and reducing its stability and/or performance is a valid and very important concern.\r\n\r\n> If they have an array like this stored inside a document then a much more immediate threat to stability is the fact that evaluating the table will return that array which has all of the problems of returning the profile.\r\n\r\nNot necessarily. They can run a map/reduce query on the array that would return a scalar, not the full array."
