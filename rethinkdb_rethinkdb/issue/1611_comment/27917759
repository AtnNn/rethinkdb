      "> I also think it jibes really well with how we're positioning ourselves as a database for realtime analytics.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, we're positioning RethinkDB as a platform for building applications (with a possibility of doing shallow real-time analytics). We can't compete with true real-time analytics systems like ElasticSearch.\r\n\r\n> As far as I know every profile is always linear size with respect to the size of the query.\r\n\r\nSure, but #1613 makes it linear with respect to the amount of data the query crunches through. If I do a map/reduce job to sum the array of 1000 elements, the profiler currently returns 1000 nodes.\r\n\r\n> I think users are going to have much higher expectations if they click a `Profiler` button and enter a different flow than if they just have a link next to the duration display to see extended information.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I'm not proposing a separate `Profiler` flow. I'm proposing to have a little arrow next to the `Run` button. If you click on the arrow you get a \"Profile\" link, and if you click on that, you get the results of a profile run. I don't think it would set higher expectations from people at all (if done skillfully)."
