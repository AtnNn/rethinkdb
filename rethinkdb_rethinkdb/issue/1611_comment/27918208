      "I realize discussing visual design at this point is premature, but having the word \"Profile\" be hidden behind an arrow is going to hurt discoverability.  If we do go with a separate workflow, or if we go with an integrated workflow where the profile isn't displayed by default, I think we should have the \"Profile\" button out where everyone can see it."
