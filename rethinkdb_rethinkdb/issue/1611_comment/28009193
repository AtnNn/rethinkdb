      "I really don't think we should let #1613 impact our decision. I just made a quick pass through with samplers to make sure that the profile would always be the same order as the size of the query because that was a simple way to make sure it wouldn't crash. It's trivial to extend this to other case like this one. But I really don't think they pose a risk to crashing right now. A user would have to submit something like a 10,000 element array statically through the data explorer, which I'm pretty sure is going to crash the data explorer no matter what."
