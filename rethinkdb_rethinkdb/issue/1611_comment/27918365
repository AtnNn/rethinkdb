      "Here's my two cents:\r\n\r\n- We should wait to present the profiling results as a first-class citizen alongside the table view, tree view, etc. until we have a minimum viable presentation that is useful and approachable to the general audience: this may take the form of a visualization, or text formatted and presented appropriately. I'd have to play with queries and examine the JSON output to determine if the JSON outputted today allows the average user to extract anything useful.\r\n\r\n- I am a strong proponent for not making the user choose to specifically profile the query. Being able to effortlessly run a query, see the output in a variety of presentations, examine the lifecycle of a query, and gain introspection into the cluster with one click is magic in a bottle. As long as it doesn't slow things down (significantly), it's a no-brainer for me.\r\n\r\n- I agree that having a simple text link carries a lower expectation than clicking a dedicated button, and allows you to get away with just showing some JSON or a lightweight rendering of the profiler results."
