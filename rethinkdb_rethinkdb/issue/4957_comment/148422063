      "I've managed to get past this hurdle:\r\n\r\nThe problem was that I had a 3 db shard, and when I attempted to restore, the shard created a bunch of duplicate database ( probably an issue with replication ), which confused and frightened rethinkdb.\r\n\r\nThe cluster was already established by the time I attempted the restore, so I'm unsure of why my cluster split-brained like that."
