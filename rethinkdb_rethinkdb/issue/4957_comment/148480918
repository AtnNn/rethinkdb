      "Hi @csaintc, sorry you had to run into this issue.\r\nWhen you restored into the new cluster, were the tables created externally by some separate script, or did you just let `rethinkdb restore` take care of table creation?\r\n\r\nI think `rethinkdb restore` should never generate table name conflicts. It sounds like there might be a bug or something else odd going on."
