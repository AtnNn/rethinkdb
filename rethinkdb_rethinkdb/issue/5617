        "In the `./test/rql_test/test-runner polyglot/meta/table.js` tests we check to see that a few methods are no longer defined on `r`, specifically `r.wait` (line 258), `r.rebalance()` (line 263), and `r.wait` with a configuration (line 348). Unfortunately the specific error message generated by the lack of method there seems to vary with the version of node we test with:\nnode 0.10:\n\n```\nObject function () {\n  var args;\n  args = 1 <= arguments.length ? slice.call(arguments, 0) : [];\n  return rethinkdb.expr.apply(rethinkdb, args);\n} has no method 'wait'\n```\n\nnode 0.12: `TypeError: undefined is not a function`\nnode 4.2: `TypeError: r.wait is not a function`\n\nOur testing system does not currently distinguish between Node 0.10 and Node 0.12, so even though we could do a slightly better job by isolating those, I think we should just look for the `TypeError` and not try and distinguish the message.\n"
