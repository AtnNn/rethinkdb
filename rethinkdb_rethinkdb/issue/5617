        "In the `./test/rql_test/test-runner polyglot/meta/table.js` tests we check to see that a few methods are no longer defined on `r`, specifically `r.wait` (line 258), `r.rebalance()` (line 263), and `r.wait` with a configuration (line 348). Unfortunately the specific error message generated by the lack of method there seems to vary with the version of node we test with:\r\nnode 0.10:\r\n```\r\nObject function () {\r\n  var args;\r\n  args = 1 <= arguments.length ? slice.call(arguments, 0) : [];\r\n  return rethinkdb.expr.apply(rethinkdb, args);\r\n} has no method 'wait'\r\n```\r\nnode 0.12: `TypeError: undefined is not a function`\r\nnode 4.2: `TypeError: r.wait is not a function`\r\n\r\nOur testing system does not currently distinguish between Node 0.10 and Node 0.12, so even though we could do a slightly better job by isolating those, I think we should just look for the `TypeError` and not try and distinguish the message."
