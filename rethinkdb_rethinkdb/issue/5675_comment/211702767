      "oh I didn't know that was a thing.\n\nI still think .get(x, {index:y}) is a lot cleaner though. Thoughts?\n\nIs it plausible for rethinkdb to have user submitted tricks and tips for\ntheir api docs? This is one thing I really loved about php docs. Lots of\nuseful snippets like this in their documentation site submitted by the\nusers solving common problems.\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 18, 2016 at 4:24 PM, chrismcc <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> @nojvek <https://github.com/nojvek> .nth(0).default(null) is the pattern\n> I use very often to avoid the error, works super great!\n>\n> \8212\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5675#issuecomment-211628732>\n>\n"
