      "I would say that it behaves as follows:\n\nNot found : null\nOne match: return that item\nMore than one: return first\n\nNth(0) gives an error when no item is found. So you can't chain it nicely.\n\nGet will return you one. GetAll returns all.\n\nIt would be nice if indexes could have constraints I.e no duplicates. So\nyou can have nice foreign keys.\n\nOn Monday, April 18, 2016, Michael Lucy <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Thanks for the proposal @nojvak!
