      "Was just chatting about this with @neumino on IRC. There is definitely a bit of user error here one my part: I didn't notice the round-trip vs server time for Query 2\8212 99% of it was non-server time in the query explorer due to HTTP.  Adding a `.coerceTo('array')` and looking at the Network tab in Dev Tools confirmed that.\r\n\r\nThat said, I first experienced this result in the drivers/TCP, which is why I was weirded out enough to post and issue. Let me double check this again using the drivers."
