      "Hi @dminkovsky , @coffeemug's explanation sounds correct.\r\n\r\nThe relatively high latency overall probably comes from the fact that `getAll()` doesn't parallelize querying for the different keys. Instead one of them will be looked up at a time.\r\nWe have ongoing efforts to parallelize query execution more. The most relevant issue is https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2156. I'm not certain if the first implementation of that will parallelize this specific query, but we will get to it eventually."
