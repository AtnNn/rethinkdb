        "An unordered table scan in Rethink is a very slow operation because we do a b-tree traversal without any awareness of disk layout. This is a problem because database dumps are extremely slow on rotational storage because of seeks.\n\nWe can improve this by making unordered scans disk-layout aware (this is obviously hard), or by somehow signaling the serializer to allow returning some blocks in a different order.\n\nLeaving this in backlog.\n"
