      "@vexocide: Before using this by default when running tests we would have to get rid of false positives and fix the crashes.\r\n\r\nThis feature seems to sometimes cause warnings to be output at runtime without changing the return value of the process. To take full advantage of these warnings, the testsuite would have to be instrumented to notice these warnings in the output logs and report them."
