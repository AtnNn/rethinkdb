      "* `letVar` is going away forever, so you don't have to worry about it.\r\n* I am not sure it's a good idea to let the user hide suggestions. It has a smell of trying to satisfy everybody by offerring options. Usually it means there should be better options -- by tweaking the suggestion box so it isn't annoying, by changing the whole thing to a more shell-like interface, etc. The suggester UI is also already very very good, so working on it further is arguably misplacing effort, considering other stuff we could be working on."
