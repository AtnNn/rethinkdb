      "Yes, I don't plan to do it in any time soon, I just want to track things to do so I won't forget one.\r\n\r\nFor the part about hiding suggestion, I was thinking about catching ESC and hide the suggestion at that time. The suggestion would come back as soon as the user write/move the cursor.\r\nThe use case is:\r\n- The user has a multiple lines query (or multiple queries)\r\n- The user is updating one line and need to see what's behind the tooltip\r\n- The user can just hit ESC to read what he needs (variable name, how is going to map etc.)\r\n\r\nI thought about making the tooltip transparent, but it doesn't look good and doesn't really solve the problem."
