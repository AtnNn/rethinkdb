      "Thanks for the suggestion @kethomassen . We've discussed this before and decided for now to keep the drivers together with the server, since it simplifies testing and maintenance for us.\r\n\r\nWe'll probably move the drivers out eventually, once there are more of them and changes to ReQL become rare.\r\n\r\nClosing as duplicate of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1740"
