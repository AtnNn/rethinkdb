      "Hi, I got a bit curious about this since I've recently started to experiment with it. As I understand it, the preferred configuration would be to add a join entry for each server in the cluster, am I correct?\r\n\r\n    ## This option can be specified multiple times.\r\n\r\nlike (for server C): \r\n`join=SERVER-A:29015`\r\n`join=SERVER-B:29015`\r\n\r\nand for server A:\r\n`join=SERVER-C:29015`\r\n`join=SERVER-B:29015`\r\n\r\nIs this assumption correct? I'm sorry if I haven't grasp the concept fully yet, since I just started looking into this yesterday. \r\n\r\nThis configuration becomes quite tedious quickly, I assume. I just recently discovered another issue, #3215, which would solve this issue very elegantly if using SRV records. I would personally prefer this over automatic configuration changes without me knowing. "
