      "So basically we would need to persist the last IP that we saw a given server in the cluster under and use that to \"seed\" the reconnection process.\r\nWe would also need to store some kind of secure ID as you described, to make sure that we don't accidentally join a wrong cluster (maybe a cluster ID as described in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1905, or possibly it would be enough to just compare the server ID).\r\n\r\nWonder what @timmaxw thinks about this."
