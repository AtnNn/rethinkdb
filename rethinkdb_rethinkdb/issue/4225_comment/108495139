      "How would the configuration change without you knowing? This would only update the configuration you have set. For example if you join a cluster, joining node gets the setup (connection information, ip's and if implemented, the possible \"username\" and \"password\") that cluster has. If you leave the cluster, it get updated to other nodes. Either case wouldn't happen without you knowing it, atleast more than it happens now.  This only saves you the trouble of having to update the configs manually. I don't see a situation where you wouldn't wan't those configs updating. "
