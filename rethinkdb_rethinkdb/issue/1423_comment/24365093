      "I think it's very plausible for people to have a table where some documents have a field `a` with a value of another document, and others where field `a` has a simpler type. It would then make sense to write a query like `r.table('foo')('a')('bar')`.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether we should handle this in `default` though. At some point we discussed ability to enforce a schema and easily filter documents by specifying a type with a shortcut syntax, this could be a good solution.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer to hold off on this until stability fixes have been completed, though."
