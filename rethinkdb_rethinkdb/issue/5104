        "I have a RethinkDB deployment on compose.io with an SSH tunnel setup to connect to it.\r\nI can do a ```rethinkdb dump``` of my remote database but when I try to restore back to the remote I get the following error for each table:\r\n\r\n```ReQL error during 'create table': Connection is closed```\r\n\r\nThe tables in the remote installation actually get created, but no data is restored. \r\n\r\nI have localhost port 28016 mapping through to the remote deployment on port 28015 and the restore command I'm using is:\r\n\r\n```rethinkdb restore backup.tar.gz -c localhost:28016 -i appdb -a $RDB_AUTH --force```\r\n\r\nI'm actually trying to update the remote rethinkdb database with a dump from my local development installation. My local rdb is running v2.2.0 but the remote on compose.io is still v2.1.4 (the latest they currently support) if that makes any difference?\r\n\r\nThanks."
