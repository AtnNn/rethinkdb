      "@danielmewes -- I don't know which exact changes (or even that it's your changes). I just recall that you've done some work on coroutines (thread-based coroutines, priorities, etc.), see that this might have something to do with coroutines, and then jump to the conclusion that you're the most likely person to be related to this issue. I could be totally wrong, but this strategy has worked quite well overall :)"
