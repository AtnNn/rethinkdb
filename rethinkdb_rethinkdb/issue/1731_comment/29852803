      "@neumino: Do you know if older versions of RethinkDB worked on this specific version of OpenSUSE?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be surprised if this was actually an incarnation of the issue seen on ARM http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19811474/how-do-i-force-g-on-linux-to-update-the-thread-pointer-for-tls-when-a-corout\r\nBut that's just speculation. I'm currently downloading an OpenSUSE .iso and will do some debugging."
