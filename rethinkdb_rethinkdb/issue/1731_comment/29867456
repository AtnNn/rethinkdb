      "It should be noted by the way that even if we solve this issue for our own accesses to TLS, it can still be an issue for otherwise thread-safe library functions (consider errno for example).\r\nNow if this will ever *actually* become an issue depends on how aggressive the compiler is in inlining things, and whether we use such functions across an on_thread_t boundary.\r\nWe could disable function inlining in general, which would highly reduce the risk of running into this. However we would first have to check how large the performance penalty of that would be."
