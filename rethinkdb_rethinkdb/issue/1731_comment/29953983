      "Status update: Currently wrapping up the `noinline` work-around for TLS access.\r\nAfter discussing this with @srh, I also replaced all direct access to `errno` from our code by non-inlinable getter/setter calls (`get_errno()` / `set_errno()`). We'll have to make sure not to use `errno` directly in the future. That being said, the risk of actually running into a problem due to `errno` being used directly seems very low."
