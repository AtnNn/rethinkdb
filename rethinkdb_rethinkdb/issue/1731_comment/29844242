      "The backtrace looks somewhat familiar in the sense that I encountered something like this while working on the pthread-based implementation of coroutines. I don't remember exactly what it was, but I had to change the implementation to work around this.\r\n\r\nNow the implementation of thread-based coroutines is not in next yet, so this cannot be caused by those particularly. @coffeemug which coroutine changes did you mean exactly?\r\n\r\nIt also seems weird that this works in debug mode but not in release. Could be some incompatibility with the compiler that OpenSuses uses...\r\n\r\nI can look into this issue later."
