      "@coffeemug Ok, I'm looking forward to see it done! Keep going the good work!\r\nI actually made the choice to use RethinkDB because I thought it was fun! So I'll be around and will stay aware of your progress!\r\n\r\nSo to end this thread, to me the solution looks like I will have to use directly PhantomJS if I want to be able to use RethinkDB. I tried with Redis as well and as @mickaelandrieu said it looks like `Casperjs can't use out of box node libraries`.\r\n```Shell\r\nError: Cannot find module 'net'\r\n```\r\n@mickaelandrieu I took a quick look and I found many posts about SpookyJS with people having issues with it. Having a wrapper around CasperJS feels like a hack to me and I'd rather learn how PhantomJS works to solve my problem."
