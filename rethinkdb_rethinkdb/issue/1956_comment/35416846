      "You need to install `libprotobuf-dev`(googling around it seems that on OSX, `brew install protobuf` should do the trick).\r\nSee http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/driver-performance/\r\n\r\nAlso while the JS driver is mainly for node, it works in the browser.\r\nI'm not sure why Casper would throw since there is a `try/catch` statement [here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/protobuf.coffee#L6)"
