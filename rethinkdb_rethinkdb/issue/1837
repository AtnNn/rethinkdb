        "In `ResponseTypeSwitch` in the file `protobuf.coffee`, we loop over `protodef.Response.ResponseType` to execute the appropriate callback.\n\n`protodef.Response.ResponseType` looks like\n\n```\n{ SUCCESS_ATOM: 1,\n  SUCCESS_SEQUENCE: 2,\n  SUCCESS_PARTIAL: 3,\n  WAIT_COMPLETE: 4,\n  CLIENT_ERROR: 16,\n  COMPILE_ERROR: 17,\n  RUNTIME_ERROR: 18 }\n```\n\nSo we could easily build\n\n```\n{ 1: SUCCESS_ATOM,\n  2: SUCCESS_SEQUENCE,\n  3: SUCCESS_PARTIAL,\n  4: WAIT_COMPLETE,\n  16: CLIENT_ERROR,\n  17: COMPILE_ERROR,\n  18: RUNTIME_ERROR }\n```\n\nAnd avoid looping over the object.\n\nThe same thing apply DatumTypeSwitch (more often). We call this method every time we want to parse a datum (in `{a: 1}`, we call it twice)\n\nPutting in subsequent, because it's not hard to do. I'll do that when I'll have a few minutes.\n"
