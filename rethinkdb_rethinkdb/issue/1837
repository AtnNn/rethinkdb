        "In `ResponseTypeSwitch` in the file `protobuf.coffee`, we loop over `protodef.Response.ResponseType` to execute the appropriate callback.\r\n\r\n`protodef.Response.ResponseType` looks like\r\n```\r\n{ SUCCESS_ATOM: 1,\r\n  SUCCESS_SEQUENCE: 2,\r\n  SUCCESS_PARTIAL: 3,\r\n  WAIT_COMPLETE: 4,\r\n  CLIENT_ERROR: 16,\r\n  COMPILE_ERROR: 17,\r\n  RUNTIME_ERROR: 18 }\r\n```\r\nSo we could easily build\r\n```\r\n{ 1: SUCCESS_ATOM,\r\n  2: SUCCESS_SEQUENCE,\r\n  3: SUCCESS_PARTIAL,\r\n  4: WAIT_COMPLETE,\r\n  16: CLIENT_ERROR,\r\n  17: COMPILE_ERROR,\r\n  18: RUNTIME_ERROR }\r\n```\r\nAnd avoid looping over the object.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same thing apply DatumTypeSwitch (more often). We call this method every time we want to parse a datum (in `{a: 1}`, we call it twice)\r\n\r\nPutting in subsequent, because it's not hard to do. I'll do that when I'll have a few minutes."
