      "From the writes performance test I have been doing with rethinkdb I can say that it scales beautifully until I have 32 nodes. Adding more nodes after that doesn't increase the write performance due to the shard limit and I eventually hit the IO limit on the nodes holding the primary replicas. Would love to test my cluster with a 64 shards"
