I think we should also bump the server-side limit to 64 while we're at it.\r\nI'm not sure how well we scale to 64 shards, but I don't believe there's a strong technical reason to restrict it to 32 (@vexocide: Are you aware of any actual limitation? I think we have limited resolution for the distribution query, but apart from that?)."
