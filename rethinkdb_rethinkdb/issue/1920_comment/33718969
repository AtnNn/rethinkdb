      "@atnnn thank you for looking into it. This would be a more accurate example of the documents that are being saved (I was wrong about the nesting): \r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/zabojnik/8715452\r\n\r\nBut it's still quite fast. I dumped the actual data that are being saved into a text file and tried to insert them via a simple script. It takes about 25% of the time it takes when I'm saving the exact same collection in the actual application (it's a sidekiq background worker). I'm certain I'm \"timestamping\" just the r...insert(collection).run command, not anything else but I don't know what could make such a big difference. The worker makes some pretty heavy lifting with that collection before it gets to the saving part so... maybe the process gets bloated or something and it slows down the protobuf...? I'll try to investigate this furthermore."
