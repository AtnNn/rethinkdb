      "We thought of dropping protobufs entirely and replacing them with raw json api. Capnp (http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/) is promising, but JSON has the following advantages:\r\n\r\n* Every language in the world anyone would want to use supports it\r\n* Because it's ubiquitous, nearly every language has a json implementation that's insanely fast\r\n* Everyone understands it\r\n* It's actually surprisingly fast and compact, much more so than one would assume"
