        "i recently upgraded to 2.3 and some of my changefeed queries now give the following error:\r\n\r\n> \"Getting a changefeed on a filter after a limit is not supported in: ((snip query error message))\"\r\n\r\nworked before:\r\n```\r\nquery\r\n.between( [ true, r.minval ], [ true, start ], { index: 'myindex' } )\r\n.orderBy({ index: r.desc('myindex') })         \r\n.limit( limit )\r\n.merge( function (obj) { return {\r\n            hash: obj('id').nth(0),\r\n            multiTenantKey: obj('id').nth(1)\r\n}; } )  \r\n.pluck( pluckMap )\r\n.changes({ includeInitial: true, includeStates: true })\r\n```\r\n\r\ni moved the order of operations around and it seems any .pluck or .merge that takes place after .limit is recognized as a .filter and not allowed. so i now have to do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nquery\r\n.between( [ true, r.minval ], [ true, start ], { index: 'myindex' } )\r\n.orderBy({ index: r.desc('myindex') })         \r\n.merge( function (obj) { return {\r\n            hash: obj('id').nth(0),\r\n            multiTenantKey: obj('id').nth(1)\r\n}; } )  \r\n.pluck( pluckMap )\r\n.limit( limit )\r\n.changes({ includeInitial: true, includeStates: true })\r\n```\r\n\r\nit works fine. i didn't see anything in the docs about this limitation, so maybe it should be included\r\ntheoretically is some performance hit because some operations are taking place before the limit and therefore a waste?\r\n\r\nthanks for your help"
