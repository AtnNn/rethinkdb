        "i recently upgraded to 2.3 and some of my changefeed queries now give the following error:\n\n> \"Getting a changefeed on a filter after a limit is not supported in: ((snip query error message))\"\n\nworked before:\n\n```\nquery\n.between( [ true, r.minval ], [ true, start ], { index: 'myindex' } )\n.orderBy({ index: r.desc('myindex') })         \n.limit( limit )\n.merge( function (obj) { return {\n            hash: obj('id').nth(0),\n            multiTenantKey: obj('id').nth(1)\n}; } )  \n.pluck( pluckMap )\n.changes({ includeInitial: true, includeStates: true })\n```\n\ni moved the order of operations around and it seems any .pluck or .merge that takes place after .limit is recognized as a .filter and not allowed. so i now have to do this:\n\n```\nquery\n.between( [ true, r.minval ], [ true, start ], { index: 'myindex' } )\n.orderBy({ index: r.desc('myindex') })         \n.merge( function (obj) { return {\n            hash: obj('id').nth(0),\n            multiTenantKey: obj('id').nth(1)\n}; } )  \n.pluck( pluckMap )\n.limit( limit )\n.changes({ includeInitial: true, includeStates: true })\n```\n\nit works fine. i didn't see anything in the docs about this limitation, so maybe it should be included\ntheoretically is some performance hit because some operations are taking place before the limit and therefore a waste?\n\nthanks for your help\n"
