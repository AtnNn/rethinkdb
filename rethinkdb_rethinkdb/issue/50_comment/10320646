      "Hi there.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our instructions fail to mention that there is not presently a good way to determine version number when pulling a tarball or zip snapshot from GitHub. For non-releases, we depend upon git to report the version number. Releases posted on Launchpad get their versions from the packaging-time control file.\r\n\r\nWe have put an unclean but more specific fallback into gen-version.sh as of 5b9d0c5a5b692ffc71f160911afefa33a9b53b89 that looks for the most recent release number in NOTES and will look into adding a warning to the instructions.\r\n"
