      "@10man: `--server-name` only sets a name if the server does not have one (i.e.: is starting for the first time). Once there is a data folder created and populated that then directs what the server name is. You can change it through the admin interface (WebGUI: \"Operations\" drop-down(s) on the \"Servers\" page) or with a ReQL command like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.db('rethinkdb').table('server_config').get(UUID_HERRE).update({'name':'NEW NAME'}).run(conn)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere was some in-person conversation in the office about whether a server should refuse to start when given a `--server-name` that does not match what it has, but a number of good arguments about cases where that would cause outsized problems convinced me that that was not a good idea (e.g.: settings files used for cluster setup)."
