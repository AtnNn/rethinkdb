      "The real issue here is that we don't yet a good way of checking the arguments to variable length API functions.\r\n\r\nPresently there is an `ar` function for API functions with a fixed number arguments and no opt-args and an `aropt` for API functions with a fixed number of arguments and any number of opt-args.\r\n\r\nI'll come up with a better solution and then implement it across the API. There are other variable argument API functions that currently have the same behavior as this one."
