      "I think rather than try to come up with an even more complicated solution to this problem for 1.14, it would be better to make the script work around this bug.  I've opened a new issue #2909 to track this.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, moving this issue out of 1.14, and opening up for discussion on how to fix this the right way (for all of `index_create`, `index_rename`, and `index_drop`).  I believe @timmaxw had some suggestions."
