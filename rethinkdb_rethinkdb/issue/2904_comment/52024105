      "It appears the fix is incomplete.  It worked on a table oversharded on one machine, but not on a table oversharded and replicated across a cluster of four machines.\r\n\r\nIn my setup, the table has 3 shards and 4 replicas (1 primary and 3 secondaries).  An `index_create` receives 24 results, which would be consistent with 3 primary shards * 8 hash shards.  However, these results seem to be a random assortment of results from primaries and secondaries.  I suspect whatever is aggregating these results is just taking the first 24 rather than only the results from the primary shards, but I don't know where this logic is at the moment."
