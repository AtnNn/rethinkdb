      "@Sxw1212 The reason `r.table().filter()` is not recommended is that `filter` doesn't utilize any indexes on the table. It has to look at every document in the table, and check if the document matches the filter criteria. This is fine for small tables and some background queries, but often not a good idea for live queries on large tables (or tables that might become large eventually). Instead, `getAll` or `between` with a matching secondary index usually yields the better performance."
