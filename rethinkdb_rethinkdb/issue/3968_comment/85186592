      "There are a two places where we have predicates like `x.arity == 2 || x.arity ==-1`; they should probably be of the form `x.arity == 2 || (x.arity < 0 && x.arity > -3)`.  `lambda{|*a|}.arity` returns `-1`, and I just learned that `lambda{|a,b,*c|}.arity` returns `-3`.\r\n\r\n(I think the only place we do this is in the new EM integration, so the only noticeable impact is that if someone overloaded a `RethinkDB::Handler` function with a function that accepts both a normal and a rest argument we'd erroneously refuse to call it.)"
