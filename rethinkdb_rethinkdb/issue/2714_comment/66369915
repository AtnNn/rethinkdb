      "From a testing standpoint it would require changes since we are currently `create`ing for (nearly) every server process. But I don't think we have any tests that actually test this area of behavior, and with the changes for `req_admin` there are less and less tests that explicitly create `driver.Files` objects (only 7 now, the rest have them created implicitly) and so would need some modification for this change.\r\n\r\n@timmaxw's last point is not really important for our test system (tests are increasingly robust for this due to sharing a db process for speed). But it might be unexpected to have the `test` database, but we are already plopping the `rethinkdb` database on them, so now is the time to make that change."
