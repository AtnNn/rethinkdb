        "The parameters to `eq_test` in `test/rql_test/drivers/driver.rb` are confusing: `def eq_test(one, two)`. You actually have to read one of the callers to figure out that `two` is the expected value and `one` is the actual value. This should be cleaned up to something more like: `def eq_test(expected_value, actual_value)` to make reading it easier (and the accompanying lower bug count). And yes... I am purposely switching the order, since that is what we do elsewhere.\n"
