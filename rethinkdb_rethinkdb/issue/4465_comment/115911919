      "In fact I can reproduce this on a single server by doing the following:\r\n```\r\nr.tableCreate('t1')\r\nr.db('rethinkdb').table('db_config').delete()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also appears to be causing a lot of test failures, since the left over tables are generating spurious entries in the `current_issues` table for some of the tests. It must be a recent regression."
