        "Hi all,\nI was trying to import some data into RethinkDB using a ruby script. It does 100 iterations inserting each time 18000 documents with a single insert command (data in each iteration is the same).\n\nAt one moment (it was on 15th iteration) I got an error (for connection lost), I checked on server and I found that RethinkDB was not running. I'm using CentOS build so I tryed\n\n``` shell\nsudo service rethinkdb status\n```\n\nand I got\n\n``` shell\nrethinkdb: mlisa: stop/crashed\n```\n\nI tryed to look into my log file (/var/lib/rethinkdb/mlisa/data/log_file) but I couldn't find anything about the crash (last entry was \"info: Server ready\")\n\nI have no idea why it crashed, it did 14 times the same thing without problem and it crashed on 15th.\n\n(I'm using a single instance on the server, no sharding and no replication)\n"
