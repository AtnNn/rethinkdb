        "The web UI doesn't seem to correspond to reality.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n- Create 4-node cluster.\n- Run this in CLI: \n\n```\n  create database dd0455cd_a824_4935_8c5b_12684c1dc9e5_db\n  create table dd0455cd_a824_4935_8c5b_12684c1dc9e5 --database dd0455cd_a824_4935_8c5b_12684c1dc9e5_db\n  split shard dd0455cd_a824_4935_8c5b_12684c1dc9e5  '2000' '4000' '6000' '8000' 'a000' 'c000' 'e000'\n  set replicas dd0455cd_a824_4935_8c5b_12684c1dc9e5 2\n  set acks dd0455cd_a824_4935_8c5b_12684c1dc9e5 2\n```\n- Insert a bunch of rows with autogenerated keys:\n\n``` ruby\nr.db(...).table(...).insert((0...10000).map{{}}).run(conn)\n```\n\nIf you do this, the web UI claims that all the rows are in one shard.  I'm not sure whether the web UI or the CLI is messing up here (or if I just don't know how to use one of them).  Assigning to @Tryneus since he can probably distinguish the two error cases.\n"
