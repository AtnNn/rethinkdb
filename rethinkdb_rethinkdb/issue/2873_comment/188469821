      "@mbroadst The reconnect information isn't even kept in Raft, but locally in a temporary data structure on each server. That's why restarting the servers gets rid of it.\r\nNow that you mention it, I'm actually not sure if you have to restart all servers at the same time. I don't think they communicate the information if they aren't actually able to connect to the server, though I could be wrong. It might be enough to restart one server in the remaining cluster at a time to make sure nobody remembers the absent server anymore."
