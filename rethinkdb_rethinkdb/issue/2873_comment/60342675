      ":+1: for completely purging the dead server from the table config for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- It's simple and gives users mostly what they want\r\n- It's not too weird because we don't just randomly modify the config -- they asked us to delete the server\r\n- Server deletion like this is a temporary affair, so even if this isn't ideal, it will do until it disappears entirely (once we roll out the raft implementation)"
