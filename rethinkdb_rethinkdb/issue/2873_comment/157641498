      "@ntquyen If you want to remove a live server, you might want to make sure that it doesn't host any table replicas before shutting it down.\r\n\r\nAn easy way for accomplishing this is as follows:\r\n1. Remove the `\"default\"` tag from the server you want to remove: `r.db('rethinkdb').table('server_config').get(<server id>).update({tags: []})`\r\n2. Reconfigure all tables through the web UI or the `reconfigure` command to the desired number of replicas and shards\r\n3. Wait for all tables to reach a stable state (until all of them are \"green\" in the web UI)\r\n\r\nBoth the web UI and the `reconfigure` command (by default) only assign servers that have the `\"default\"` tag. Hence, after following the above steps, the server that's to be removed will no longer be assigned for any table and you can shut it down safely."
