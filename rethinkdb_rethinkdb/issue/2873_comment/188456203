      "@danielmewes yeah we are trying to do the latter, so I think we'll have to come up with a clever way to temporarily block incoming reconnect attempts.\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, in our experimentation we see that there is no need to manually delete from `server_config`: the entries disappear. This leads me to believe that the information used for reconnects  is probably kept in the internal raft structures, rather than picked up from `server_config`. \r\n\r\nIs there sufficient interest for supporting these scenarios with rethink? I'd be willing to investigate what changes would be required on a source level, as this would be particularly useful in our case. "
