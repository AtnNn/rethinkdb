      "Sorry to go back on this, but could you take some time and consider how much work it would take to remove this notion entirely? If it's a matter of a few weeks of additional work, I think we should do it in the first release of new clustering.\r\n\r\nThis is the only part of the clustering API that I feel *really* uncomfortable about. The notion of permanently removing servers turns out to be very clunky in practice and is really difficult to explain to people. Even when we do explain it, people still don't entirely understand its implications. Then there is the notion of zombie machines, which people find extremely confusing. It also isn't an edge case -- anyone who runs a RethinkDB cluster runs into this pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nDropping this notion in favor of simply removing the offending machine from the table's config makes everything *dramatically* simpler and easier for people to understand. How hard would it be to do in v1?"
