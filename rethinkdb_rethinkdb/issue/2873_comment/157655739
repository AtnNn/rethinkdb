      "@danielmewes and @coffeemug Thanks for your clarification. What I want to do is moving one of the databases in the cluster into a new cluster so that it won't affect each other in term of resources. So I think I can try:\r\n1. Reconfigure the moving db's tables to one of the nodes, \r\n2. Shutdown that node and start it again without joining the existing cluster. \r\n3. In the old cluster, delete the moved database\r\n4. In the separated node, delete all missing databases that's not on the node\r\n\r\nI'm testing that strategy but it doesn't work as expected. Other things, shutdown that node will cause downtime which I don't really want, but it seems impossible to avoid that."
