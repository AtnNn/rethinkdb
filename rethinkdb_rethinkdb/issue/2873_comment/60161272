      "If a server is permanently removed, should we do any sort of automatic reconfiguration? Currently it will appear to be missing from any `table_config` entries that it used to be present in, but the tables will continue to wait for the server to return before proceeding. Obviously we should change that; maybe we could just change it so that the tables don't wait for the server and proceed with one fewer server. Or, should we try to patch the hole in the config by e.g. picking a replica as director if the server used to be director? @coffeemug"
