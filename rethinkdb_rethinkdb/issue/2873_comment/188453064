      "@mbroadst If you plan not to restart that server, there's no need to shut down the other nodes. They will occasionally try reconnecting, but it won't have any other effects.\r\n\r\nHowever if you're going to set up a new RethinkDB server on the same host and you don't want it to join the same cluster, I believe there's no way around restarting all servers at the moment from the RethinkDB point of view. You could theoretically set up a firewall of course to stop the other servers from reconnecting.\r\n\r\nI don't think you can delete from `server_config`. We should consider adding a feature to disable further reconnect tries to a given server."
