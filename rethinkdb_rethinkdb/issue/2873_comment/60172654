      "I think we should proceed with one fewer servers.\r\n\r\nWe will mention in the message from the web UI that declaring a given server dead is going to remove replicas from the following tables.\r\n\r\nIf the server had been the only replica of a given shard that shard would end up with no replica at all. I think that's actually a good thing, because it will make the fact that the data for that shard has been permanently lost explicit rather than automatically replacing it with a new empty shard (like we do now)."
