      "@phil-hildebrand the problem is that any node that has ever been up and a part of a cluster maintains an immutable internal list of nodes they have \"known\" for a hardcoded 24 hour period. The only solution at the moment, as you have noted, is to shut _everything_ down. I have a PR up [here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/5596) to allow users to specify a custom timeout for those cached entries.\r\n\r\nTheoretically you could set that timeout to something incredibly small and allow for easy removals, but I haven't tested that yet. I did mention a desire for a deeper conversation on that PR about perhaps bundling in the node's name as part of a \"handshake\" to enable more dynamic node configurations, maybe you have some thoughts to contribute over there?\r\n\r\n"
