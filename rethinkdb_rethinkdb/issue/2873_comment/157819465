      "@ntquyen Unfortunately in order to accomplish that you'll also need to briefly shut down all other nodes, or they will still \"remember\" the server you want to remove and will keep connecting to it.\r\n\r\nIt's also somewhat risky to delete the database on one of the clusters. If in the future you accidentally join the clusters together again, that deletion would propagate and blow away your data.\r\n\r\nIt might be better to start with a fresh cluster and to use `rethinkdb dump` / `rethinkdb restore` to move the database over. Is that an option for you?"
