      "@ntquyen -- the functionality has been removed because it's no longer necessary. In earlier versions of RethinkDB when a server joined a cluster it was added to the metadata. If the server ever left the cluster, it would show up as an issue until it was explicitly removed, even if the server wasn't responsible for any data.\r\n\r\nIn more recent RethinkDB versions servers can freely join and leave clusters -- removing them manually is no longer necessary."
