      "@danielmewes we have a case where we would like to remove a rethinkdb node from a cluster, disregarding the data loss (so different than the above case) but without the requirement to shut down all other nodes in the cluster in the process. Is this as easy as clearing out those entries from the `server_config` table? What other mechanisms are in place to maintain the \"memory\" of the node we are trying to remove, causing the cluster to attempt to rejoin the node to the cluster."
