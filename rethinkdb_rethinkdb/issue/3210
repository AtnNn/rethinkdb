        "I always thought rethinkdb would function similarly to RAID5. Where you could have a number of servers hosting a table and one of them dies the others can take over until it comes back online or a replacement is added. \n\nHowever most of my tables have 8 shards and 3 replicas and when one of the servers dies it takes down part of the table because the master for that section is not available. I thought it would simply make clients connect to the secondary nodes until the master comes back online\n\nIs it possible to configure rethinkdb in a way so that if one server dies the other servers simply take over? I'd like it so that there is zero downtime if a server fails in the middle of the night. \n"
