      "@danielmewes: I agree. I was thinking that we would have the function raise the alarm when it was still a conservative distance from the end of the stack, but it would be nice to know how large that distance actually is. We can also implement this incrementally; every time someone finds a way to break the server, we can add a call to this function and a corresponding try/catch block."
