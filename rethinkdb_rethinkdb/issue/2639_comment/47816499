      "The difficulty is handling the exceptions in all the places they could occur in.\r\n\r\nIt's not generally sufficient to check on functions that recurse based on user input, unless we know relatively precisely how much stack space the functions that recurse (or call other functions) not based on user input can maximally use.\r\n\r\nIt's probably possible to handle this in some places, and still crash if the overflow happens in other places.\r\n\r\nAs a first step, it would make sense to actually measure how much stack space we are currently using for typical and a few \"extreme\" queries."
