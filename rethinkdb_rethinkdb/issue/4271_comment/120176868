      "I think we should probably stick with exceptions for most query language errors.   Non-existence errors are really the outliers because they're the only errors that don't abort the whole query.  (In terms of the code, moving off of exceptions for non-existence errors will just mean adding an `undefined` type with a lazy error message.)"
