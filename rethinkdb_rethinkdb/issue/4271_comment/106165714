      "I looked into this a little bit.  It's hard to delay the formatting because it frequently depends on local variables.  I think the best solution would be to have a coroutine-local variable that tells us whether or not we're going to use the message, and if we aren't going to use it we don't bother formatting it.  We'd set the variable whenever we enter a ReQL catch block and set it back whenever we leave.  Does that seem reasonable to other people?"
