      "Maybe?  Currently you can call `rcheck` without an env available.  It may be that we can thread an `env` through everywhere we need it, but I'm not sure how much work that would be.  (It would probably be less work if we only threaded it through in places where we needed do an rcheck that produces a non-existence error.)\r\n\r\nWhy are you opposed to a coroutine-local variable in this case?  It seems clean to me because it can pair 1-1 with the exception handler, which is coroutine-local."
