      "Thanks for the comments @mlucy and @timmaxw!  Agreed that the first thing to do is to eliminate the formatting -- and I think that the 90% guess is a good guess, as that would get the pathological function filter case (the third case) back down to the still-pathological-but-not-quite-so-bad JSON filter case (the second case).  I do note that in that second case, we never end up in datum_t::get_field() for missing attributes; happy to dig in more here if it would help...\r\n"
