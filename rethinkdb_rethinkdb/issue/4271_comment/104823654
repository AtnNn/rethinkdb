      "Hi @bcantrill. Sorry you ran into this issue, and thanks for the detailed analysis. It looks like there are two separate issues here: the fact that we're formatting the document for every failed lookup, and the fact that we're using C++ exceptions to represent ReQL exceptions. The former issue is relatively easy to fix, but the latter would require more work. @mlucy @danielmewes, any thoughts?\r\n\r\nEdit: Specifically, I'm thinking that we could defer exception formatting until the exception is actually being shown to the user, perhaps by making `ql::exc_t` abstract with a virtual method that does the actual formatting."
