      "What's the actual source of belief that we should have a `pseudotype()` prefix/suffix on non-JSON types?\r\n\r\n> It seems cleaner to have them in their own namespace.\r\n\r\nSo people have to write `.coerceTo('PSEUDOTYPE(TIME)')` to appease some unspecifiable ick factor.\r\n\r\nWe're not going to just start extending JSON, are we?  Every extension we make will be a pseudotype with some JSON serialization.  So there's no risk of namespace collisions.  Just disallow types to be registered that match the existing JSON types, whatever their names are.  (The API page doesn't say what their names are, for some reason.)\r\n"
