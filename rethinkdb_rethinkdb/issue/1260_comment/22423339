      "@mlucy -- I have two reservations about this:\r\n\r\n1. It's not clear to me that having user defined types in their own namespace is better (I think there are some arguments to be made both ways).\r\n2. Regardless of 1, the issue of what to do with builtin pseudotypes seems orthogonal. (we might want to treat them differently from user-defined types).\r\n\r\nI think we should get back to these questions when they become pertinent. Since we're in the 11th hour here, leaving the final decision up to you. We can always revisit later."
