      "If we do do this, I would prefer the syntax `PTYPE<TIME>` (since angle brackets have a proper connotation here in a lot of people's minds). However, I'm still a bit uneasy about this. Could we perhaps do something else? For example, just return `TIME` and have `.info()` add `{pseudotype: true}` to the resulting object. Do you think that would be sufficient?\r\n\r\nI think if pseudotypes give people grief, we can still organize the docs in a way where it's googleable, but it would be really nice to not have to worry about `PTYPE<...>` from the user's POV."
