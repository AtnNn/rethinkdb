      "We can shorten the name, but I don't think we should try to hide the distinction between types and pseudotypes.  They're actually different.  Even users who don't care about the difference will at least have something to google if a pseudotype is behaving unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n(Also, with this printing scheme we have the pleasant property that all pseudotypes sort greater than everything else, and the index printing code is easy to do correctly.)"
