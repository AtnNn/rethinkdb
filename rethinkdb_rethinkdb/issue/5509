        "Now that we have `eachAsync` for automatically awaiting async operations before continuing to read from the cursor, it would be nice if the concurrency could be controlled. This would essentially be equivalent to [`Promise.map(..., { concurrency: <int> })`](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promise.map.html#map-option-concurrency) from bluebird.\n\nWhile this can be done in user-code with relative ease, I think it's useful enough (namely in tuning the performance of bulk operations) to consider implementing.\n\n``` js\nconst concurrency = 10;\nconst pending = [];\n\ncursor.eachAsync((job) => {\n  Promise.resolve().then(() => {\n    if (pending.length >= concurrency) {\n      return Promise.any(pending);\n    }\n  }).then(() => {\n    let p = asyncHandler(job).then(() =>\n      pending.splice(pending.indexOf(p), 1);\n    );\n    pending.push(p);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nProposal:\n\n``` js\ncursor.eachAsync(asyncHandler, { concurrency: 10 });\n```\n"
