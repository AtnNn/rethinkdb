      "@neumino You're great :) \r\nI do have one more question, which is OT though: what's the best place to ask about RethinkDB? I kinda feel bad opening topics for things I think are issues, and then they turn out not to be :) DBA StackExchange? StackOverflow? What do you guys follow and where? Or is it only the Google Group and IRC?"
