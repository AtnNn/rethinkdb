      "I see. Actually I need to use ```r.object``` cause the key is dynamic, I just simplified the example for this issue, but thanks for pointing it out @neumino .\r\nI think this should be clearer explained in the documentation, with more examples of the usage of things like ```getAll``` for example. Yesterday I was literally reading through everything in the docs and banging my head against it, since I had an impression it would be a strange design decision for this not to work like that.\r\nAdding examples - both basic and more advanced usage like this, possibly with real data structures, would really help newcomers ease into RethinkDB.\r\n\r\nThanks @chrisvariety !"
