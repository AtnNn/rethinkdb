        "We've had a pretty large number of users create a secondary index and then get confused about whether the index is ready for use or not. So far we've been telling them to just query the index, but this question came up enough times that I thought I'd open an issue to discuss this. There are a few options I can think of to address this problem:\n- Document the behavior better and point people to an FAQ entry every time this comes up\n- Change `index_create` to be blocking\n- Add a command `index_ready(block=True)` that returns true if the index is ready to use, false otherwise, and blocks until the index is ready if `block` is set to true\n\n@jdoliner -- what do you think?\n"
