      "The origin of this call to `load_inner_buf` can only be `mc_inner_buf_t::mc_inner_buf_t(mc_cache_t *_cache, block_id_t _block_id, file_account_t *_io_account)`. That one in turn is only called from the `mc_buf_lock_t(...)` constructor, meaning something tried to load a block which does not exist on disk."
