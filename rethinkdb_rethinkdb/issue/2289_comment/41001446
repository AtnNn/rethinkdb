      "@coffeemug \r\n\r\nThe current sample will grab 100 records using random distrobution. which is great. But if you know something about your data. lets say you have 600 minutes of data and you wanna take 1 minute sample for every 5 minutes of data. for that 300 of that 600 values the method i suggested would allow that. your able to control that its every 5 minutes it will pick one of the values insteed of just total random sample. if someone still wants to just get a random sample in any order they would just use r.sample().limit(60)"
