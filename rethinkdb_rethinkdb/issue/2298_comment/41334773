      "So, this only crashes the server in debug mode, which I think is desired behavior.  (This isn't in our code, Google's protobuf library crashes there in debug mode rather than producing an error we can handle.  In release mode it produces an error we can handle later.)\r\n\r\nIn release mode you get back \"failed to deserialize query\"."
