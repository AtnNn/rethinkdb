        "Right now every optarg is a way to crash the server. Consider the following query:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nr.js(\"1\").run(timeout=r.js(\"1\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that when the query language tries to evaluate the term `r.js(\"1\")` it looks for an optarg called `timeout` in the global optargs and finds the term `r.js(\"1\")` it then tries to evaluate this term to get a value for the optarg. But of course before it can evaluate a `js` term it needs to have a look at the global optargs to see if there's a timeout. This eventually crashes the server with a stack overflow.\r\n\r\nI think we should just make optargs be statically evaluated (like `profile` and `noreply`) already are. I don't really think anyone has a need to pass complicated expressions as their optargs. And allowing them to do so would require something ugly like a flag to disable optargs during execution or something. It really doesn't seem worth it to have this ugliness."
