      Just
        "Most of our artificial tables operate with `squash` semantics when creating a changefeed on them. This is regardless of what the `squash` parameter to `change` is set to.\n\nFor most tables the results will still be close to what users expect, but for the `jobs` table it makes an important difference since a lot of its entries are very short-lived. Most queries that run for less than one second will never appear in a changefeed on the `jobs` table.\nUsers might not expect this behavior.\n\nI'm not sure yet if this is a good idea or not, but would like to put it out there:\nThe proposal is to reject changefeeds on the `jobs` table if `squash` isn't set, or is set to a value smaller than `1.0`. This will make it clear to users that they can't get non-squashing semantics from the jobs table. It makes it minimally more annoying to create changefeeds when a user isn't aware of the requirement, but at the same time makes the semantics much less surprising.\n"
