      "I talked to @jdoliner about this is what happens:\r\n\r\nWhen computing blueprints, there is a flag which specified one of these conditions:\r\n1. Loss of availability is ok\r\n2. Loss of availability is not ok\r\n\r\nIf we reshard a table over the web UI, this flag is always set to \"loss of availability is ok\". The problem here is that this is a global flag. It is not limited to a given table.\r\n\r\nWe should extend this flag such that we can tell the blueprint suggester that it can only lose availability on a given table, but not on other tables. I think in most (if not all) places where we call fill_in_blueprints in our code we know which table(s) the user is actually changing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we can reduce the number of changed blueprints, that could also reduce the overhead of meta operations in a large cluster."
