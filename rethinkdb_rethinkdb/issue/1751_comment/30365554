      "> This was in my branch daniel_realtime_message_hub with a few additional modifications, but I think the chances are high that this is an issue in next as well.\r\n\r\nYes, this *does* happen in next and even in 1.11.x!\r\n\r\n1. Create two tables.\r\n2. Shard the first table\r\n3. Continuously run queries against the first table\r\n4. (Re-)shard the second table\r\n5. Queries against the first table fail (e.g. \"lost contact with master\")"
