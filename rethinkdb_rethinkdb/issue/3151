        "Right now users have to manually set up SSL tunnels / VPN / SSH tunnels to securely run a RethinkDB cluster on an open network (see e.g. the guide at http://rethinkdb.com/docs/security/).\n\nIt would be great if we could make that easier, e.g. by providing some scripts to partially automate the setup process of an encrypted RethinkDB cluster.\n\nI imagine the user experience to work somewhat like this:\n- Generate a key (-pair)\n- Copy the key to all RethinkDB servers\n- Provide the key to the RethinkDB instances through some configuration or command line option\n- Have some magic that sets up for example SSH tunnels as needed to get the cluster up\n\nI'm not sure how practical this is, given that it would have to work in a lot of different environments, different versions of OpenSSH etc.\nI think it's worth investigating though, as it would significantly improve the user experience for many people.\n\nMaybe we can also do something to make encrypted client access easier to setup? (_Edit:_ This is now tracked in #3158)\n"
