        "I am getting the following message appear in command prompt which seems to be killing the rethinkdb server. `rethinkdb: Memory allocation failed. This usually means that we have run out of RAM. Aborting.`\r\n\r\nThe issue that is more worrying is that after this crash my data file has been corrupt. I get the following error when starting rethinkdb `error: This doesn't appear to be a RethinkDB data file.` \r\n\r\nAs a side note is there anyway for me to recover this data from the file?"
