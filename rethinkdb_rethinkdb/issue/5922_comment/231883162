      "Actually the administration console might be different.\r\n\r\nIf you have direct access to the database server, can you try whether you can still open a RethinkDB client connection on localhost:28015 under load, without going through an SSH tunnel?\r\n\r\nAnother question: Are you using RethinkDB users or a RethinkDB admin password? The password authentication can use a bit of CPU."
