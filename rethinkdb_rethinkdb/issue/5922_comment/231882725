      "I'm unfortunately not familiar with `autossh`. Does it open a single SSH connection, or multiple ones on demand?\r\n\r\nSo basically you're saying that if you open a second SSH tunnel, you can open more connections to RethinkDB without timing out, but if you rely on autossh it stops working when the server is under load?"
