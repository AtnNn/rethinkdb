      "Thanks @janisz !\r\nIf you haven't done so yet, would you mind taking a look at http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/ and signing the CLA? We require this for legal reasons before we can merge a pull request.\r\n\r\nThe change itself looks good as far as I've seen in a quick glance.\r\n\r\nI personally would prefer not to apply this change to the files in `src/rapidjson`, `src/cjson` and in `rdb_protocol/geo/s2` since those are based on external projects.\r\nThe further we diverge from the upstream code, the more difficult it becomes to rebase and/or backport upstream fixes from those projects to our code in the future.\r\n\r\nOthers might have different opinions on this though.\r\n@VeXocide what do you think?"
