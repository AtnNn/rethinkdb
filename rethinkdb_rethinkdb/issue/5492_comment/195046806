      "@janisz For running the tests and get somewhat better output, you can try:\r\n```\r\n$ make test-deps\r\n$ cd build/release\r\n$ ./rethinkdb-unittest\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are also integration tests:\r\n```\r\n$ cd test/rql_test\r\n$ ./test-runner -j 9\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the tests don't work for you, please let me know. The tests might require some additional dependencies to work properly. I can simply check out your branch and run the tests on our system."
