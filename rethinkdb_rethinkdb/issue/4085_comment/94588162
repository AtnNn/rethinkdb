      "The approximate locations of your shard split points are as follows: `[\"53\\x1f\"]`, `[\"8d\\xa0\"]`, `[\"ae4\"]`, `[\"c\\xe2i\"]`. You can measure the number of documents in each shard by running e.g. `r.table(\"8cc37b90_436c_4f77_ba81_f02b9491db20_metrics\").between([\"53\\x1f\"], [\"8d\\xa0\"]).count()`. Could you do that for each shard and report back? We can compare the results of those queries against the results given in the graph to figure out of the table is actually unbalanced or not.\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed that your primary keys are arrays. What are the elements of each array and how are they generated? Is it possible that the distribution of data has changed since you sharded your table?"
