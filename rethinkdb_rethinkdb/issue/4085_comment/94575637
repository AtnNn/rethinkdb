      "The document distribution estimates are really unreliable. I'd guess that the documents are actually distributed evenly between the shards, and the graph is just wrong.\r\n\r\nCan you paste the output of `r.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"_debug_table_status\")`? That will tell us the actual shard boundaries that were chosen, and we can use that to find out more."
