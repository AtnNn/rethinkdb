      "When we implemented auto-failover, we rewrote some of the clustering logic, and a side-effect of that rewrite is that RethinkDB will remain available during a rebalance. Previously, the previous primary for the shard would shut down as soon as the rebalance began, but the new primary wouldn't come up until the rebalance was finished. But under the new auto-failover logic, the old primary will stay up until the new primary is ready to take over."
