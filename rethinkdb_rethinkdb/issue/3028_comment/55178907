      "In the discussion for CR 2077, @mlucy suggested the following:\r\n\r\n> A few ideas:\r\n> * Adding some sort of cost-estimation function to the greedy algorithm like I suggested.\r\n> * Swapping -- when the case in the comment occurs, see if there's any replica on `A` that can be moved to `C` to make things better. (This is no longer greedy -- it's effectively a one-level-deep search on top of a greedy algorithm -- but I think that's fine.)\r\n>\r\n> I think this is important because when the server does obviously stupid shard/replica allocations on simple setups, it makes people wonder why it's so bad (because it seems intuitively like it should be a really easy thing to get right)."
