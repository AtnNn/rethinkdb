        "I'd like to insert documents with a resolution function like in #3753, for example I want to keep the document with a more recent timestamp. When passing a function with python or javascript I get the Error: Expected type DATUM but found FUNCTION. I tried the following in the data explorer as a test and am still getting the same error. Help in understanding this error would be appreciated. \r\n```\r\nr.table('foo').insert(\r\n  [{id: 0, a: 3}, {id: 1, a: 2}],\r\n  {\r\n    conflict: function(id, old_doc, new_doc){\r\n    return r.branch(\r\n      old_doc('a').lt(new_doc('a')),\r\n      new_doc,\r\n      old_doc\r\n    )}\r\n  })\r\n```\r\nAlso documented here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37553022/rethinkdb-insert-and-conflict-resolution-function-syntax"
