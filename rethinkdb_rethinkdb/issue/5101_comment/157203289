      "@tayloramurphy, this looks pretty good to me, thanks for the pull request!\r\n\r\nI think `nsj` is a little strange for the name of the format.  The closest thing I could find to a standard for this format was http://jsonlines.org/ (which suggests `jsonl`) or http://dataprotocols.org/ndjson/ (which suggests `ndjson`).  I think renaming it to `ndjson` would be a little cleaner and more apparent to users."
