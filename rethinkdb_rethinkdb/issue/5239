        "There are many real-time solutions for \"realtime web\" (arguably not comparable to RethinkDB). Ideally, It'd be great to have something that works seamelessly on \"mobile apps\" ideally with offline-first and real-time sync abilities. When can we expect great iOS/Android libraries? .. which can make rethinkdb a true much-needed Firebase alternative. Hoping to contribute to make this happen. Thanks in advance."
