        "At least I think this is the case, going by the docs.  The docs say:\n\nLazily iterate over the result set one element at a time.\n\nExample: Let's process all the elements!\n\n```\ncur.each(function(err, row) {\n  return processRow(row);\n});\n```\n\nSo, let's make a simple sample program.\n\n```\n    r.connect({host: 'localhost', port: 28015}, function(err, conn) {\n        // TODO: Error handling.\n        r.table('numbers').run(conn, function(err, cursor) {\n            var i = 0;\n            cursor.each(function(err, row) {\n                console.log([\"Row \" + i + \":\", row])\n                i += 1;\n            });\n        });\n    });\n```\n\nIt's missing something: a call to `conn.close()`.  Where do you call `conn.close()`?  There's no way of knowing when it's safe to close the connection.\n"
