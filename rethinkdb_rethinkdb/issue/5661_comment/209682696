      "@encryptio all good points. I really like the semantics of `.map()`, accepting either a constant or function, and that tends to be how you expect most ReQL terms to behave. It would be nice if we could preserve that here. The use of `r.literal` in my examples was to disambiguate the single-arg `catch` overloads. In hind-sight that's probably more trouble than it's worth. So I agree that function handlers should be the preferred way of doing things."
