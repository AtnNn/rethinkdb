      "+1.\r\n\r\nJust to add, we have a number of applications where we store some metadata into RethinkDB and create databases and tables by naming them as the auto generated ID of these metadata records. This use case occurs too often for us. And just because of this restriction on `-` character, we need to do string manipulation all over the place. This will be a very nice modification for us."
