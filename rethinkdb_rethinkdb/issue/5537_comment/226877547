      "I also think we should add `-` and call it a day. I'm still attached to the idea of keeping database/table names as close to PL identifiers as possible. Making an exception for `-` seems reasonable because it's empirically useful to a lot of people, but the case for expanding the valid character set even further seems weaker to me."
