      "> It would be really annoying to have to go back and add more legal characters later.\r\n\r\nI don't think it would be *that* bad. :-)\r\n\r\nWhile adding escaping to the backup tools isn't technically hard, I'm concerned about the required development and testing effort that we might better spend on other things at this time.\r\n\r\nNote that the escaping isn't just about escaping shell arguments, but about mapping disallowed characters to allowed ones in a reversible way (e.g. we couldn't just put a `\\` in front of illegal characters. Ignoring that `\\` is an illegal character itself, we would generally need to completely get rid of the illegal characters in the string).\r\n\r\nApart from escaping, at least `rethinkdb import` also still uses period as a db.table delimiter in its command line option format (for `--table`). So further changes would be required.\r\n\r\n> I would vote for just adding support for \"-\" and opening another issue to support any db/table name after the backup tool is changed.\r\n\r\nI'm in favor of that."
