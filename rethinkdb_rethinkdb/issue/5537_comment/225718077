      "Specifically on `.` in file/database names: there are a number of places where we display tables names in `DB.TABLE` format. Allowing `.` in the names would make those places more confusing. At a minimum we would have to go over everything (including documentation) and scrub those. I would rather leave them as-is and continue to disallow `.`.\r\n\r\nI am vaguely against allowing `/`, but don't have any solid reasoning there."
