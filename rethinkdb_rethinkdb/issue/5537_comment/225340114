      "It would be really annoying to have to go back and add more legal characters later.  I've personally wanted \".\"s and \"/\"s in table names before (when I wanted a table per website and a table per nested directory, respectively).\r\n\r\nPersonally I would vote for allowing any db/table name at all and having our backup tool do escaping.\r\n\r\nIf people think that's overkill, my second vote would be that anything you can type on a qwerty keyboard should be legal (and our backup tool should still do escaping -- not being able to have \":\" or \"/\" in db/table names would be unfortunate).\r\n\r\nIf adding escaping to our backup tool is too much work, I would vote for just adding support for \"-\" and opening another issue to support any db/table name after the backup tool is changed."
