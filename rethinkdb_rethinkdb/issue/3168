        "As a first step, we should make it easy to manually run workload X (defined in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1369 ) in a well-defined manner so we can actually use it as a tool for testing and benchmarking.\n\nAt the moment things are only partially automated. You have to manually set up tables and servers, then populate the table, and finally write a small shell script that actually starts the workload.\n\nAs a second step, we should see if we can run one or multiple well defined test configuration(s) for workload X automatically on a regular basis.\n\n_(Note: I put a few fixes to workload X and the stress client README in code review 2191. Those are just things that showed up when I wanted to send the script to one of our users. I suggest not beginning work on this issue before those fixes are merged)._\n"
