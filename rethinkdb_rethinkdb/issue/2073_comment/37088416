      "One problem is that `rdb_erase_range()`, if called while secondary indexes are under post-construction, causes blobs that have already been deleted to be detached.\r\nAlso generally it seems like the same blob might get deleted twice when a deletion is processed from the sindex queue.\r\n\r\nDon't know if that causes these crashes or not."
