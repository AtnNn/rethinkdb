      "This looks like a problem with your SSH configuration. Like @beefsack says, you might be able to get better help for that problem in a Linux-specific forum.\r\nHow do you normally connect to your server through SSH? You can simply add the `-L` option to your usual `ssh` command and it should start forwarding the port.\r\n\r\nWhat are you intending to do with the `iptables` rules? If you use an SSH tunnel to bind the RethinkDB port to `localhost` on your local server, the `iptables` rules are probably unnecessary.\r\n\r\nFinally, note that using `--bind all` is dangerous because it opens up access to your RethinkDB database for *everyone* on the Internet, unless you also set up a firewall to restrict it. Using an SSH tunnel is usually the much safer option."
