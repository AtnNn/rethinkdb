      "Cool. I started making some changes but didn't finish. I got about 1/3 there syncing up the Java driver to C# but ran out of time. It didn't seem too hard, just keeping track of the entry point of all the queries and on `Connection` and passing `awaitResponse:true|false` for those `run` methods on `Connection` that expect/not-expect a server response to add (or not add) an awaiter (and avoid `toCompleteableFuture`). Should be much easier in Java since the Java driver doesn't have any extra CLR type `Run*` methods like the C# driver. \r\n\r\nYou can ping me for a quick review if needed."
