      "I looked a little into it.\r\n\r\nWhat freezes the interface is the browser recalculating the layout. And as far as I know, in case of a large response, there is a little I can do (except truncate the response from the server).\r\n\r\n\r\nI removed some extra span for strings. It should be slightly faster, but it still freezes, so you don't really feel a difference. \r\nIt's in branch michel_2481_large_response, in review 1628 assigned to @mglukhovsky \r\n"
