      "I actually think truncating would be ok here. For example, an array of 100k uuids of recently inserted documents is really helpful in a programmatic context, but kind of useless in the web UI. I think we should consider truncating embedded arrays in documents to, say 100 elements, and then add `...`. That would fix the freeze and I don't think it would detract from the use of data explorer."
