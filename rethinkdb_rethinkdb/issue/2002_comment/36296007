      "@timmaxw is right. We don't take a snapshot on the backfill receiver.\r\nWe could do that once we extent the cache to be able to swap snapshotted blocks out of memory, but at the moment it's not possible (the snapshot would use a lot of memory).\r\n\r\nIf a backfill is interrupted, the data on the backfill receiver can be in all kinds of inconsistent states. It's not just data that had been modified since the previous time the receiver has been synced. Even older data can be temporarily deleted during the backfill. If the backfill proceeds normally, that data is reconstructed later from the backfill sender. But if it is interrupted, there is no such guarantee."
