      "> Does that mean that if the client gets a \"not enough acks\" error the write always still goes through?\r\n\r\nIf the client gets a \"not enough acks\" error the write *almost* always still goes through.\r\n\r\nIf this is a problem, we can check the number of connected secondaries before beginning the write. If there aren't enough, then we can reject the write before we even start it. There will still be some cases where the client gets a \"not enough acks\" error and the write goes through, but the most common case will be for the write not to go through."
