      "@timmaxw, the only problem I can think of with that is that because backfills don't happen in chronological order (I assume), users may end up with rows from yesterday but be missing rows from last year, not following any predictable pattern.  And if they have rows that cross-reference each other, their data is now in an inconsistent state."
