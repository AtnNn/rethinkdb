      "Good news, everyone!  This problem exists in 1.11.x as well, so it's not a result of anyone's recent refactors!  Unfortunately, that means this has been in for god knows how long.  After an inspection of the code, it appears that the metainfo block knows that there's a newer version out there, so it's trying to backfill it before becoming primary.  Seeing as there is no newer version available in the cluster anymore, we need some way for the reactors to realize this.  Investigating options."
