      "> If the backfill is large, we'll need another solution.\r\n\r\nI meant create a new b-tree on disk for the backfill, dump the backfill in there, then if/when it's done, traverse the tree, update the \"main\" tree, and when that's done, delete the backfill tree.\r\n\r\nWhat you/@danielmewes are proposing (#1944) seems way better, though. I think we should do that."
