      "To clarify, the reason why I thought \"two secondaries\" matters is because if in case of blowing away the data we have to delete X completely (see example above), it will be backfilled from one of the secondaries. Or will it? Do we backfill to all secondaries concurrently, or to just one at a time? To K secondaries?\r\n\r\nIf after declaring the primary dead we go back to the state as if the partial backfill never happened, then this is perfectly fine IMO. If you use async replication (i.e. no write acks), that's expected.\r\n\r\nIf X gets deleted completely on two secondaries and zero write acks, that's actually a pretty big problem. Which one is it?"
