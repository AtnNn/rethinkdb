      "I opened a separate issue for write acks -- see #2039.\r\n\r\nI think both options so far are really bad. Ideally, either the whole backfill would go in, or it wouldn't, assuming the secondary stays up. The primary failing half-way shouldn't affect this. We could do it by storing the information from the backfill on a secondary separately, and then either just dropping it all, or applying it all to the btree in a batch. (Unless we're backfilling an empty secondary, then no copying is necessary)."
