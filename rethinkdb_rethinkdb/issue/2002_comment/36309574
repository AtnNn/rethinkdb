      "@coffeemug, unfortunately this is a bit over my head, I've only touched the edges of the btree and reactors.  I mean, if there is no coherent version of the data in the cluster, then we have no choice but to blow away what we have and fall back.  I really like the idea of snapshotting before backfills, but I don't know how much work it is to make that feasible.\r\n\r\nFor the record, the fact that a write can be committed without the required number of write acks means that we will have data divergence with automatic failover, and we will have to handle this same sort of issue in that case.  I don't suppose that can be changed, though, as it would slow things down quite a bit."
