      "@Tryneus: We *could* in theory make non-acked writes never happen by allowing transactions to be rolled back. The solution to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1841 might allow for that.\r\nBut I think that feature is pretty far away and needs a lot more thought. Also really making this work in this scenario would require extra communication between the replicas (something like 2PC I guess)."
