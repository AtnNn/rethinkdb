      "> I think we should require admin intervention.\r\n\r\nConsidering that:\r\n\r\n* This issue has been there all along\r\n* It's a rare enough thing\r\n* It's not even a thing if the server is configured well\r\n* To get it they have to declare a machine dead (which warns people in big bright red letters that they might lose data)\r\n* Both options are pretty bad and it's the best you can do\r\n* There are other important things to fix\r\n\r\nI think we should pick the easiest option, implement it for now, and then do the right thing in 2.x. Which of the options is easier to implement?"
