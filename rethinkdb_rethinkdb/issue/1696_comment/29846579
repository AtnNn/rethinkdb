      "@wojons -- thanks for the ping. We are working through the performance issues now and there is a lot of stuff happening internally to get these all fixed. There are some issues we're working on that might resolve this one, so unfortunately we have to wait until those get into next. So the only thing to do here is wait.\r\n\r\nWe definitely did not forget about this. It will be tested and fixed before the LTS. I'm sorry it's going to take a bit of time, but unfortunately that's out of my hands."
