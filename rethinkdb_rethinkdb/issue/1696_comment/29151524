      "@coffeemug i spent some time working with @danielmewes on this. I dropped a secondary index but system got into a weird state and dropped the table, we then ran it with a table with 4gb cache (but because of cache bug became 16gb when then lowered it to 2gb so it would be 8gb of cache. something interesting is that the problem still occurred around the 2.7 million record mark. then did made a change to try it with --no-direct-io and since then no problems have occurred."
