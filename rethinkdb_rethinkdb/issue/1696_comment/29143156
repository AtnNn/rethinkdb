      "The suddenness of it would imply that there may be a significant part of the tree that can no longer be accessed from RAM directly and needs to be read in from disk. It's just a hypothesis though -- definitely could be wrong as I haven't ran any tests. I'd prefer to wait until the new cache is in to retest this (there of course might be other things we need to fix then), but we'll see what we can do."
