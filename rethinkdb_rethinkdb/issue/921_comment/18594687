      "It can happen if you kill and restart your cluster with new data in less than 5 seconds.\r\nI have seen that a few times.\r\n\r\nThe web ui doesn't have time to time out and clear its data. And we don't check that all current data has been resent by the server.\r\n\r\nWe could enforce that but I think it's kind of overdoing it (especially since we may (soon?) send diff instead of the full semilattice)."
