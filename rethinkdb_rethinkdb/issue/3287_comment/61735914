      "We could definitely make the `r.point()` constructor deterministic again, since it doesn't perform any form of complex math (it only compares the coordinates to check that they are in range). Do you think that would help?\r\n\r\nThe same wouldn't work as easily for the other geo constructors because they use operations that are potentially suspectible to rounding errors (such as intersection tests)."
