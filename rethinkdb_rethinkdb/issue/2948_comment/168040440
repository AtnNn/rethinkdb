      "When a connection is opened to the server a default database is defined in the connection. The Data Explorer should behave the same. It seems to have the default set as `test`.\r\n\r\nThe issue is when debugging scripts made by a ORM (thinky in my case). The resulting query doesn't define which database it is using since the connection has it. Thus it's impossible to to take the query it generates and debug/profile it since everythere it calls `t.table()` it looks for the test database.\r\n\r\nI suggest a drop down above the explorer text area where the database is selected. If I then enter a query that begins r.database() then the value of the dropdown is set to this value entered in the query.\r\n\r\nThe call needs then to define this value when it opens a _new_ connection for the purpose of running the query.\r\n\r\nTo be able to debug and profile auto generated queries, I need to capture them, then examine them manually looking for references to r, update them, then run them. Slow and painful as you might imagine.  The alternative for me is forcing the ORM to use database calls to force them rather than use the connection."
