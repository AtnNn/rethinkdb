      "Sorry for taking so long to respond, I forgot to earlier! There was nothing logged to dmesg, and unfortunately syslog had cycled over and I don't have logs from that long ago. However, I did remember seeing something in the syslog regarding RethinkDB when it quit, although it wasn't the OOM killer, but it was a single line entry which I forgot the exact contents of (was quite terse, I don't think it was that human readable). I believe it contained an exit code, and I dismissed it as just logging RethinkDB quitting because it was a service running on startup by init.d, however it might have be caused by an out of memory when the child process was created."
