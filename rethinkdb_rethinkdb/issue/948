        "The --help for ./configure says that you must write `--fetch PROTOC` or `--fetch PROTOBUF` to force fetching of those libraries.  But really you must write `--fetch protoc` and `--fetch protobuf`.\r\n\r\nEdit: Well, it doesn't precisely say that.  I thought it said that.  It actually says to use `--fetch <dep>` and then the next line says to use `<dep>=<path>` with all-caps deps.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nWhile we're mentioning minor typos in the configure script, it also says \"CoffeScript\" somewhere."
