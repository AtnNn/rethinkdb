        "Currently the language drivers are not include with the Mac .pkg. This means that after installing the .pkg you have a nicely running server, but no way of connecting to it other than through the admin interface.\r\n\r\nI don't think that we should instal the node/javascript drivers, as that would require also installing node. We probably should include this for all of the versions of Python and Ruby that we support (even if they are just symlinks to the same file)."
