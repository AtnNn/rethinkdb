      "@danielmewes flags are fine as long as its also supported in the config file and commited out by default because lots of people may have config mangment. also when you say hevely rounded it will be like user has less then 100 tables user has less then 1000 tables and so on. I guess how that can help stop you from guessing users but in the end there will be more users then you can guess really and knowing some info like super large tables and so on could help but its ur call."
