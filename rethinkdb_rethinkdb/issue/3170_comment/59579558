      "Maybe we should return `2^(round(lg(size)))` instead of the exact size in bytes. That would reduce the amount of identifying information further while still giving us good usage statistics. We could even do the same thing for cluster size if we wanted.\r\n\r\nThis might be overkill, especially since users will already have to trust us not to track their IP address."
