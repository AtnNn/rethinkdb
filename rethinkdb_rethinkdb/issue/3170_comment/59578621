      "So here's an updated conservative proposal of what to send (adapted from @larkost):\r\n1. RethinkDB version\r\n2. Number of servers in the cluster\r\n3. uname -psr (e.g.: Linux 3.2.0-67-generic x86_64)\r\n4. Accumulated size of all shards on the machine (in bytes)\r\n\r\nThis doesn't allow us to detect mixed clusters, but I think it gives us a lot without making users trackable at all (unless they use some custom kernel, maybe we should restrict the uname one a bit more)."
