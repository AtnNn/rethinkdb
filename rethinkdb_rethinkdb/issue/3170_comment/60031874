      "For what i am thinking is this should be a cluster level thing checking for updates or not. So then the next thing needs to be making sure the user is okay with it. I think when the user first loads the UI dashboard or the admin console that is when they are aksed about sending data upstream version checking and so on. and then it should be easy from UI or CLI to enable or disable or to run a one time check."
