      "> I assume we would print the message again if the server is restarted; otherwise we'd have to persist the last seen version to disk, and that's annoying.\r\n\r\nSure, the only motivation is to not flood the log by printing a daily message that would accumulate over the period of months.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the proposal sounds great.\r\n\r\nA few more notes:\r\n\r\n- We should still keep the web ui ping\r\n- We should add a source field to the ping (e.g. web ui vs server)\r\n- We (obviously) have to change the update server to log relevant new data if it doesn't do it automagically"
