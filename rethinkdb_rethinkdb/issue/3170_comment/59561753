      "I'd prefer to err on the side of sending too little data.  It seems OK to me to have the server check for updates, as long as there's a way to disable it, but sending back cluster stats seems a little weirder.  (Just my opinion, though.  It might be that I'm out of sync with the times and people are perfectly OK with sending back usage stats by default.)"
