      "I agree, I think there's a difference between pinging for updates and sending anonymized data. It seems like pinging should be opt-out and stats collection should be opt-in. That being said, install time is probably the wrong time to ask them to opt-in. That should be really smooth, and maybe the web-ui could have a notification in it somewhere if the config option isn't set explicitly. That sounds like a new issue entirely though"
