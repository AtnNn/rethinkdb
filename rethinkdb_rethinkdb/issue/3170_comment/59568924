      "If we have stats as opt-in then almost no-one is going to actually opt-in making the stats worthless. I think that as long as we are clear, allow for opt-out, and make sure that the data is *never* useful except as aggregate data that we would both be on the right side of things as well as non-shocking when users suddenly learn of this.\r\n\r\nThe data I would be comfortable with:\r\n1. RethinkDB version\r\n2. cluster and server uuids (those are essentially random data)\r\n3. number of servers in a cluster\r\n4. limited information about the machine, something like `uname -psr` (e.g.: Linux 3.2.0-67-generic x86_64)\r\n\r\nI toyed with including things like memory size, but that starts to feel wrong. I don't know that I can articulate where the line is for me. Similarly I feel we should promise that we would never capture the source IP address for that data (which could in theory be used to develop profiles of customers).\r\n\r\nThis would give us a lot of information about where we should be concentrating our work."
