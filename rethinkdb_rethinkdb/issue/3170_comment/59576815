      "I think having multiple options is overcomplicating this. It should be a simple \"turn off all communication with RethinkDB Inc\" switch.\r\n\r\nAh, my assumption was that servers would submit the data in irregular intervals. We should keep in mind that in some setups servers are restarted e.g. once each night (for example for log rotation, or updating parameters). However that's probably rare.\r\nIf we do the \"check once every 24 hours\" approach, we should discard the request that's sent at startup in our statistics (we would just flag it somehow). That way if someone temporarily starts up a server for testing purposes or is experimenting with configuration options etc. that wouldn't be counted. We would only count servers that have been running for at least 24 hours."
