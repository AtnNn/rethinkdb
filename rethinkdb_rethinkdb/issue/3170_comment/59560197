      "I also don't think we should add opt-in stats features. I don't want to complicate the installation process, and having an opt-in arg somewhere isn't worth it because too few people will set it. So if we don't feel comfortable with collecting data to the point where we'd ask someone to opt-in, we shouldn't collect it at all."
