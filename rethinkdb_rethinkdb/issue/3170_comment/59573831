      "My reasoning in including machine UUID's was to make sorting out duplicate entries easier (so we don't double, or more, count things), and having some quasi-random tag for clusters would allow similar de-duping. And I think that us promising to disregard IP address means that we could develop some profiles, but we then can't (generally) connect that to any specific person/company [1]. Which would be my worry.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond de-duping I think it is worth being able to tell when people are using heterogeneous clusters (from RethinkDB version, hardware, and OS perspectives). That is one dimension we are not testing at all right now, and at some point I could see it biting us.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes: total database size feels fine to me, and maybe even size of largest table. Part of my criterion is \"what would be irresistible for marketing?\". The cluster size and number of users both sit on that line, but on the other hand are so valuable for prioritization that I think it is worth walking the line on those.\r\n\r\n[1] Of course there could be exceptional cases like we already know of a group with exactly 100 servers in their cluster, then we could pick them up out of the data. But at that point we already would have the targeted data that I would worry about."
