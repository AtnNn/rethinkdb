      "@drakester1 @rataw -- we purposely didn't include the functionality into the server because we were worried about privacy. We didn't want people to look at their firewall logs and discover that the server calls home to find if there are newer versions. We thought it would rub users the wrong way.\r\n\r\nDo you think this is something that would bother you?"
