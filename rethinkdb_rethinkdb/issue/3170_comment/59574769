      "Why are repeated submissions a problem? I don't think they would be very common.\r\n\r\nEdit: I am imagining that each server will check in at startup and every 24 hours thereafter. So if we take a 24-hour slice of the data, that should be a mostly representative sample of servers. Servers that have been repeatedly restarted will be overrepresented, but I don't think that's very common."
