      "Incidentally, this would give us much better visibility into usage numbers which would be very helpful for the company. It would be great to do it ASAP, so moving to 1.16 proper.\r\n\r\n@drakester1 @rataw -- would you be opposed to us also sending the cluster ID to the servers? This way we could collect statistics on the sizes of people's clusters which would help us guide product development (e.g. should we prioritize certain scalability features?) It would be a unique UUID, which is essentially a random number. We couldn't tell anything about you or your data from it (other than the size of the cluster and which machines/IPs belong to a given cluster)."
