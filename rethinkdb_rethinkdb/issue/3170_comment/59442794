      "@AtnNn could we ask such a question during package installation (through debconf for example?)?\r\n\r\nIf it's not easy I believe we should not bother with asking at the time of installation. Instead we would have a configuration flag to disable the update check.\r\n\r\nWhich data would we send exactly? I'm not sure if we have such a thing as a cluster ID. If we do, we should send the cluster ID and the machine ID of the current server. Otherwise we could send the list of all machine IDs in the cluster.\r\nWe could also send the total size of all database files together, and maybe the number of tables (but not their names).\r\nAll that information together would give us a much better understanding of the size of deployments."
