      "Just to chime in, in our local environments we restart the RDB process very frequently (several times an hour - our scripts trigger it on every rebuild since there's no harm in not doing so), and in general it is confusing to ask individuals to upgrade when we actually keep a unified version & upgrade all at once.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like there will be a single launch-time flag to opt out, which will work great for us.\r\n\r\nI have seen upgrade notifications in the webUI before - will this also turn that off?"
