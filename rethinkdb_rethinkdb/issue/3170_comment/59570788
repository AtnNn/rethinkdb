      "I agree with @larkost . We should not store IP addresses if at all possible. His list of things to send also looks reasonable\r\n\r\nInstead of sending the UUIDs of all machines in the server as I had suggested, what @timmaxw says is probably even better (sending the machine's own UUID, and the number of servers in the cluster). That way we wouldn't even know *which* machines are together in one cluster, but we can still calculate the size distribution of clusters.\r\n\r\nI think something like the total database size (in bytes) would be very useful. @larkost would you consider that crossing the line?"
