      "Maybe we could have a `tableDescribe()` command that provides an object of some sort that can be used to re-create the table including all settings and secondary indexes?\r\nThis is closely related to the question of copying a secondary index (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2797 ), though some additional work is required for cloning the whole table.\r\nI think this will also become easier when we have a ReQL interface for configuring a table's metadata.\r\n\r\nI imagine that cloning the actual (non-meta) data would be a separate step."
