      "I wa also thinking if this is to be done it should be something like a copy-on-write sort of things where the copy table has a new file that has blocks matching to the old file and when ever a block starts to get touched by the parerent able or the slave table the new entry (if being updatd by clone table) or the old entry (updated by parent table). This way crazy load is not added copying the table. The big use case for this is anaytlics and data transforming. "
