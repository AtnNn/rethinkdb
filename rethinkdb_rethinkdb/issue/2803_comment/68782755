      "@internalfx That's a very neat tool. Thanks for sharing!\r\nA minor improvement: To handle tables that don't use the default primary key field name `id`, you can retrieve the primary key of the source table through `r.db(sourceDb).table(table).info()('primary_key')` and pass it into the `tableCreate` call through the `primaryKey` opt arg."
