      "@alejandro -- cool thanks, would really appreciate you following up if you encounter a bug again. Do you still have the core file? If you do, we'd appreciate you sending it even if the server now starts fine. (If you tell me how big it compresses to, I'll get you the appropriate file transfer link).\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
