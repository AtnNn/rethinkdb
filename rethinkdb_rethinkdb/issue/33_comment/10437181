      "@alejandro -- sorry it took so long to reply, somehow this slipped through the cracks. The core file gets generated by the kernel automatically when the program segfaults. It's typically a file named 'core' located in the directory where the program was started from. So, for example, if you start rethinkdb from the home directory and it crashes, you should find a file named `core` there. If you can't find it, it's possible that the core file functionality is disabled on your system. You can enable it by running `ulimit -c unlimited`.\r\n\r\nWe'd really appreciate if you could send the core file on this bug, because we can't reproduce it here."
