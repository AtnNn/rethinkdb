      "I'm a big fan of the \"sane defaults that are easy to override\" model.  99% of users will be happy sending batches of, say, 100, so we shouldn't force everyone to specify a batch size when only 1% of them care.  (We should, of course, make it easy for that 1% to override the default batch size.)"
