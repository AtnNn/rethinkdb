        "Right now sindex function throws an error it will crash the server. An example of an error would be if someone did the following:\n\n``` Python\ntable.sindex_create(lambda x: x[\"sid\"], \"sid\")\ntable.insert({\"id\" : \"foo\"})\n```\n\nPart of this issue is figuring out exactly what we want to do in this case. The two proposals I've heard are:\n- Don't index the doc\n- Index the doc with `null` or a special value as the key and do things to make it not show up in places we don't expect it (i.e. in slice operations).\n"
