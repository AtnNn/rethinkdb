      "Thanks @danielmewes. I previously thought that the serializer version might need to be bumped. The `./scripts/pre-release.py` script tells me that the cluster version in next is 1.15. The serializer version is still at 1.13 and the driver magic number at V0_3.\r\n\r\nI believe only the driver version numbers need to be bumped. They get bumped during the release process, after the release notes have been merged and before the release gets tagged."
