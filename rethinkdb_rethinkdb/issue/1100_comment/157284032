      "@srsgores While rethinkdb is running, the web ui should be accessible on port 8080 by default. When you say you get nothing, what does that mean? Is there an error, in that case which one? Is there an html document that seems empty? If so, does the JavaScript console report any errors? Have you tried with a different browser? Does the log contain any errors?"
