      "* I'm not sure that that's true. Once the tool is available, people might choose to use it (and I suspect some would). It doesn't hurt to have a better tool in one's toolbelt.\r\n* The RethinkDB team is still small. I don't think we should extrapolate our current preferences to future engineers. The Visual Studio port would be a long game."
