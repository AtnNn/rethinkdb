Sorry, we don't have nightlies.\r\n\r\n[/ipfs/QmeaNpgJd2Uwharad1o1dcDx9K1m3i93vx7BUkiEcCJqi5/RethinkDB-windows-alpha2.zip](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeaNpgJd2Uwharad1o1dcDx9K1m3i93vx7BUkiEcCJqi5/RethinkDB-windows-alpha2.zip)\r\n\r\nMost of the issues mentioned above have been fixed, including support for `r.js`. It might also now work on Windows 7 or Vista, but I haven't been able to test that yet (my development machine is a Chromebook)."
