      "@jasonhansel You should be able to enable Hyper-V through the Control Panel, it's in the Programs and Features dialog; and says \"Turn Windows Features on or off\".\r\n@zoontek the BIOS should have nothing to do with Hyper-V directly, those are just options regarding hardware processor virtualization (by the CPU), which of course, as you said, should be enabled as well for everything to run nicely (it's not necessary though, afaik)."
