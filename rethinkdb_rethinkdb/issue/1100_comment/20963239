      "MinGW (and may be even Cygwin) would definitely make the job easier, though porting effort would still be a non-trivial project. This might be a good way to offer people a port, though in the long term I would definitely prefer a proper port to Visual Studio. This is somewhat of a personal preference though, so I'm not certain if it will get scheduled -- we'll have to evaluate it when the time comes."
