      "Regarding compiler and build system: many big projects like Firefox or FFmpeg are totally fine with using MinGW, however they include a lot of C code which does not compile with Microsoft compiler. There is also CMake which is quite popular for cross-platform projects and Google Chrome uses scons. I find latter to be problematic with latest Microsoft compilers however, CMake works better."
