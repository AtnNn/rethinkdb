      "@egeozcan In general it has issues that we are considering for the release after the one we are currently working on, where release means something like going from 2.0.x to 2.1.x. It doesn't necessarily mean that all issues in `subsequent` will make it into it.\r\nIn this specific case, we think that it will be around RethinkDB 2.3, though this isn't absolutely fixed yet."
