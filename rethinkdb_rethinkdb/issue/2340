        "Something that should not be the end of the world would be a multi range between. Assuming the user is using the same index and they want to run a between on values 100-200 and 500-600 they would need to use a union with a between in both entrys.\r\n\r\nI feel that if a user wanted to do something like 100-200 150-300 and 500-1000, that the system should parse and see there is an over lam and then do 100-300, 500-1000 .\r\n\r\nThe syntax of this could be one of a few things.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table().between(100, 200).between(500, 600) \r\n```\r\nThe query parse has to be smart enough to not lazy load them\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table().between([[100, 500]], [[200, 600]])\r\n```\r\n\r\ni think its harder to read but it could work but i guess is up to you guys"
