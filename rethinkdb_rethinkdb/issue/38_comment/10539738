      "Hmm, so I just got the VM and ran your query. For me it crashed because the rethinkdb process ran out of memory and was killed. This is easy enough to fix but it seems to match pretty well with your symptoms could this be the problem? Running rethinkdb with only 512 Mb of memory isn't fully recommended but it can be done by decreasing the cache size of the tables."
