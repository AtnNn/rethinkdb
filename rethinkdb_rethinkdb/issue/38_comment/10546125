      "There was a patch designed to notify processes of low memory conditions so they can take some action -- http://lwn.net/Articles/267013/. Unfortunately I can't find the relevant block device on Ubuntu 11.10, so either most distros disable it in the kernel, or the patch never went through. I'm not sure what a good way to detect when OOM killer spins up is, but it'd be great if we could find one so we can warn the user."
