      "Well, of course *every* responsible sysadmin would turn overcommiting off on a server, so malloc would indeed fail.\r\nhttp://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting\r\n(the every in there is ironic. I know that many people don't do it, and there might even be occasional reasons not to)\r\nAlso, malloc can still fail with overcommiting on, as some heuristic is apparently at work in the kernel that decides whether and how much to overcommit memory."
