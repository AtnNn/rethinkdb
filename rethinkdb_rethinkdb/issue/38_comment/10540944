      "I was under the impression that modern Linux only allows malloc and friends to fail when the *address space* is exhausted, and instead deploy the OOM killer when memory is exhausted.  So that would be hard to gracefully error on.\r\n\r\nWe could in theory periodically check how much memory we're using and warn if we're using too much."
