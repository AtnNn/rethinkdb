      "If this is indeed the case, we should give a good error message in case of out-of-memory conditions (e.g. if malloc fails, crash with an intelligent error message). Of course even printing a good error message in those conditions may not be possible, in which case we should ideally detect that the condition might occur and print a message in advance. Tricky, but certainly doable and will save people a lot of grief."
