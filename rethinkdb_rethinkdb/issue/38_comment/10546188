      "@spicyj In my case it popped up with a message that the process had been killed due to memory usage in the main window (the one I got when I started the virtual box session). If this is indeed the case and you need to run rethinkdb in low memory conditions the way to do it is by decreasing the sizes of the tables. This can be done in the optional settings of the create table dialogue. I ran with 256 MB of cache and still hit the oom although it did take a lot longer. I think you need to take it down as low as 128 total for it to work."
