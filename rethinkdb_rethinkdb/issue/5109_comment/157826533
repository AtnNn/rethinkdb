      "@Agamennon is there a chance you could export the data and send us a copy? My email is daniel@rethinkdb.com . We can also sign an NDA if necessary.\r\nThat would make it a lot easier for us to reproduce and investigate the issue locally.\r\n\r\nWhen you say \"cpu is at 1%\", is that the case even while the query is running?"
