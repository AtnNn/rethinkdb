      "For this small data set, I really doubt that it has anything to do with i/o, since everything should fit into RethinkDB's cache (except for the first run of the query after a server restart).\r\nVariations in the range of ~20% are not uncommon, and can be caused by client connections being scheduled on different CPU cores and a few other factors. An incoming connection is randomly assigned to a core. If it gets on a core that also has a bunch of other things scheduled on it, it might run more slowly.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5115 should help with the general performance of the query once we get to it."
