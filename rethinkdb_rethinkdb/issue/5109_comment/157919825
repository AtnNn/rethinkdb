      "it's shared (host1plus) it uses HDD + SSD cache, so to further test this i opened a droplet on digital ocean (SSD only) to test variation there, and it's better, more stable, but still varies about 40ms from time to time, the server time there is about 200ms, but as more data gets in this will get into the intolerable quick. Also my production vps will be on host1plus a HDD + SSD, all other processes seem to hold up ok in there throughout the day. the only one that's \"misbehaving\" seems to be rethinkdb, perhaps a IO issue on this kinds of environments? i could test different configurations for the db, any suggestions?  by the way (the server have 1.5g ram 4 cores) my current configuration is standard, i try using more cache 512mb, and i get the same results (after all all the data fits on a floppy disk for now, i also try setting cores to 4) "
