      "Great.\r\n\r\nSo I think I should raise when `skipped != 0`, and `get/get_all` was operating on a primary key.\r\nWhen fetching from a secondary key, returning `skipped!=0` would not trigger an exception, unless the secondary index is marked with a `uniqueness` constraint.\r\nIn the case of between, nothing is raised.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit convoluted, but I want to raise when the developer does a point update on a non existing document (perhaps an invalid id?). Maybe I'm over-thinking this."
