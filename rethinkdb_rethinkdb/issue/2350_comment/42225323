      "This looks like a bug -- the behavior of `get_all` should be equivalent to the behavior of `get`. Pinging @mlucy.\r\n\r\nBTW, there are legitimate cases where `skipped` could be not zero. For example, let's say you're doing a large range `update`, and someone issues a point-delete on one of the documents while the range update still hasn't gotten to it. In this case `skipped` would be set to one, and you it's debatable whether you want to throw in that case. Most likely, the user would choose to do nothing."
