      "Could we get come clarifications on the `skipped` semantics in the docs?\r\nEspecially with a `get_all` / `between` on a secondary index which values are shared among many documents.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, is this what's going on:\r\n1) The number of documents that could be updated is calculated before doing the updates\r\n2) The documents are updated\r\n3) set `skipped` to the number of documents that could be updated minus the number of updated documents.\r\n"
