      "Also, protocol wise, the test seems a bit strange. I can't get back any error response from the server with this particular test... The driver sends a `CONTINUE` and the server happily sends back **197** changes.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"t\": 3,\r\n  \"r\": [ //197 changes// ],\r\n  \"n\": [\r\n    1\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo error that I can see anywhere in the response. I'm looking for **\"Changefeed cache over array size limit, skipped...\"** but can't find it.... Maybe this is a **vnext** thing?"
