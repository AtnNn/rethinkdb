      "@bchavez Thanks for the input.\r\n\r\nActually, the RethinkDb driver [documentation](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/java/) (At the very end of the page) states that the connections are not thread-safe and recommends users to open a connection per thread or use a connection pool, so I wrote a pool like so.\r\n\r\nPoint 2 makes a lot of sense. As of now, I'm the only person working on the project and it's a small app so it works for now. I'll revisit the connection pool architecture in the future when the need arises.\r\n\r\nThanks for the advice.\r\n"
