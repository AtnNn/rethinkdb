      "@bchavez Yup. One last question, off the top of your head, would you see any problem with the connection pool I've written. I don't close any connections once I'm done using them, just return them to the pool. Basically,\r\n```java\r\nConnection conn = pool.acquireConnection();\r\n//Do task with conn\r\npool.releaseConnection(conn);\r\n```"
