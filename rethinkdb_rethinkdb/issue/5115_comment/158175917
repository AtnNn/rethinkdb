      "@danielmewes by \"small\" do you mean less than the array size limit? Also, how would you even know which side is small(er) without reading both into memory first? Especially in cases where you're doing a `.getAll` on a secondary index, like in the example you mentioned. Are you guys persisting subtree counts to disk or something?"
