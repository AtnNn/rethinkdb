      "@danielmewes @VeXocide Yesterday I added a commit which makes this compatible with older versions of OpenSSL. The tradeoff is that we only get to specify one elliptic curve to use for ECDHE. The default is the P-256 NIST/FIPS curve but we still have an option for specifying a different curve if the system admin knows what they are doing. Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed that there's a developer preview of RethinkDB for Windows which is slated for 2.3. Since this PR is also part of the 2.3 milestone, does that mean I have to make sure this will work on Windows or is there a team of Windows Devs that can port this? Honestly, I haven't investigated how much effort that would be.\r\n\r\nOh, *one more thing!*\r\n\r\nI published a Docker image which has a build of this branch: https://hub.docker.com/r/jlhawn/rethinkdb-tls/\r\n\r\nI tried to make the image as minimal as possible so it's mostly just the `rethinkdb` binary and some dependent libs. I just recently built it so there's not much documentation for it at the moment, but I'll put together a guide on how to set up a 3 node cluster with mutual TLS authentication and a proxy node with the web UI secured with TLS and driver connections secured with TLS using the existing authkey method for authenticating clients. Expect that some time soon this afternoon."
