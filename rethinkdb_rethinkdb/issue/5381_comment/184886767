      "OpenSSL 1.0.1. does support `ECDHE` if I understand correctly, and will, by default, send a list of all curves it supports which is clearly undesirable. It boggles my mind that OpenSSL became a defacto standard.\r\n\r\nFortunately we're not the first to run into this and it turns out there's an undocumented `SSL_CTX_set_tmp_ecdh` calling `SSL_CTX_ctrl` with `SSL_CTRL_SET_TMP_ECDH` under water which can be used to set a single curve. This is based on http://openssl.6102.n7.nabble.com/question-about-ecdh-functions-td38239.html which seems to explain how it is to be used. If possible it'd be cool to select the first curve from `--tls-ec-curves` though that might prove tricky.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't an option I'd be comfortable adding `EDH`, especially now that we have `--tls-dhparams`. I'd like to prevent statically linking OpenSSL for the the reason that @danielmewes mentions, it doesn't have the greatest track record."
