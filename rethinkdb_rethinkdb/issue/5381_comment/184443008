      "Awesome, I'm looking forward to this.\r\n\r\n1. Testing\r\n    I'm not quite sure how to best fit this into our testing infrastructure to be honest, hopefully @larkost who maintains this can chime in.\r\n\r\n2. Documentation\r\n    We have a separate repository for documentation, it's at https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs, and it'd be great if you could open an issue there with the list of parameters you've added. A technical writer can take it from there to add the necessary documentation.\r\n\r\n3. Configuration file\r\n    I've just been told that the configuration options are converted to command-line options internally, so this should already work.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all the work you've done here!"
