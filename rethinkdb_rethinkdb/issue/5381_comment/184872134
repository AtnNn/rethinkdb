      "I've got some potentially sad news: I use the following OpenSSL function for ECDHE:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nint SSL_CTX_set1_curves_list(SSL_CTX *ctx, char *list);\r\nint SSL_set_ecdh_auto(SSL *s, int onoff);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it looks like these are only available in OpenSSL 1.0.2: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/ssl/SSL_CTX_set1_curves.html\r\n\r\nI don't see any way of configuring ECDHE in earlier versions of `libssl`.\r\n\r\nI've been building this so far on my Mac with OpenSSL 1.0.2 installed and I ran into an error when trying to build it on an Ubuntu 14.04 system. The latest version available on that distro is `OpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014`. It looks like it works on Ubuntu 15.10 though: `OpenSSL 1.0.2d 9 Jul 2015`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think I should do?"
