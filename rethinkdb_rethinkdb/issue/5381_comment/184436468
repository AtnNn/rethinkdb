      "The last commit adds 3 additional options that we discussed: `--tls-ciphers`, `--tls-ec-curves`, and `--tls-dhparams` to give administrators more control for configuring TLS, though the defaults should be recommended if possible. This should enable backwards (and possible forwards) compatibility with clients and other versions of OpenSSL.\r\n\r\nThe next few things I was wondering about are:\r\n\r\n1. Testing\r\n\r\n    How would one add unit/integration tests for these TLS capabilities?\r\n\r\n2. Documentation\r\n\r\n    Should I add this or is there another team that works on documenting features and 'how-to's?\r\n\r\n3. Configuration file\r\n\r\n    I haven't added this yet, opting only for command-line options. It should be fairly straightforward to add those options to the config file."
