      "You shouldn't worry about the Windows compatibility.\r\nWe've had some discussion about this internally. For Windows the code will need some changes to get OpenSSL to work with the asynchronous networking code. On Windows you can't just do a non-blocking read or write and wait for a notification once you're supposed to retry, but instead need to register something they call completion ports (this post seems to describe all the details: https://famellee.wordpress.com/2013/02/20/use-openssl-with-io-completion-port-and-certificate-signing/ ).\r\nThis is something we can take care of post merge (though if you want to look into it, that would be awesome too of course! The Windows preview is build from the branch atnnn/windows2 I think)."
