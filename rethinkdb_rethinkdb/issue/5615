        "Our MacOS uninstaller is an Applescript application, and up to MacOS X El Capitan (10.11) those did not require application signatures. It seems that that has changed, so we need to figure out how to sign it, and start doing so.\n\nThe work-around is simple: right-click on the scriptlet, and choose \"Open\". Depending on your Gatekeeper settings you will then have the option to run it at the warning box.\n"
