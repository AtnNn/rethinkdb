      "@jdoliner -- I haven't tested his data yet, but the interruptor bug is something I haven't seen on Linux before.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug -- OS X **is** a second-class citizen.  Maybe that will change once we finally set up automated testing for it, but right now when someone running on OS X writes in with a bug my first thought is always \"I bet it's OS X\".  How close are we to getting tests running on OS X, do you think?\r\n\r\n(Also, as an aside, do we really want to encourage people to run RethinkDB on OS X in production?  I don't think that's a setup we want to support long-term.)"
