      "I would be opposed to doing this because it signals that we treat the OS X build as a second class citizen. I don't think that's what we want to do -- the OS X build shouldn't be any more \"evaluation only\" than our Linux builds.\r\n\r\nI'd much prefer to get tests running on OS X ASAP. I've finally gotten an introduction to Travis people, so I'm working on this right now."
