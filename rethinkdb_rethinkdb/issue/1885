        "@wojons noticed that one of his nodes became very slow. It was backfilling from another node, and by looking at ajax/progress, we could see that the backfilling was extremely slow indeed. Took about 30 seconds for a single block.\r\n\r\nWrites seemed to get through only sporadically. It would pause for 5 seconds or so, and then process a bunch of (backfill) writes, and then pause again.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the slow RethinkDB instance had a relatively steady disk write throughput of ~50 MB/s. CPU usage was higher than I would expect at this kind of throughput, but not maxed out (usually between 20 and 50%).\r\n\r\nRestarting the instance didn't change this.\r\n\r\nThen @wojons shut down the node, deleted the table file completely, and brought it up again. With the fresh table file, backfilling was back at normal speed (disk throughput was roughly the same, ~60 MB/s).\r\n\r\nCould be the same as https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1385 but I'm not sure."
