      "Hi @let4be. The timeout behavior seems to be specific to the Go driver. Our official drivers don't have any timeout like that, except for the first handshake during connection setup.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the solution for this is simply to disable the timeout.\r\n\r\n@dancannon do you have any additional insights on this?"
