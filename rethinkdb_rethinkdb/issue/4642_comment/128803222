      "Hi, currently the driver has a global timeout setting which is used for both connecting and queries. I think that having timeouts on queries makes sense but clearly it needs to be possible to ignore this for changefeeds. I will look into adding this soon.\r\n\r\nFor now I think @danielmewes is correct in saying that removing the timeout for now is the best solution."
