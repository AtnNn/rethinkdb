        "From config/args.hpp:\r\n```\r\n// We assume there will never be more than this many blocks. The value\r\n// is computed by dividing 1 TB by the smallest reasonable block size.\r\n// This value currently fits in 32 bits, and so block_id_t is a uint32_t.\r\n#define MAX_BLOCK_ID                              (TERABYTE / KILOBYTE)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis limits the size of one shard to 4 TB, if not even the size of all the data for the whole table residing on a single node. (are all shards of a certain table stored in the same file?)\r\n\r\nThis should be documented somewhere.\r\n\r\nAlso, the limit should be increased.\r\n\r\nThe maximal value that can be stored in a uint32_t = block_id_t is 4 * TERABYTE / KILOBYTE - 1, which would allow for 16 TB of data per shard. One more value has to be reserved for NULL_BLOCK_ID, so we would end up with MAX_BLOCK_ID = 4 * TERABYTE / KILOBYTE - 2 (assuming MAX_BLOCK_ID is inclusive, I have not checked).\r\n\r\nChanging this will have an effect on both the on-disk and in-memory LBA index structures in the serializer. I'll have to check the code to find out what kind of effect."
