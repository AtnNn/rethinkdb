      "Performance of the other two drivers should also be looked into. Our limited experience with profiling so far suggests that client bottlenecks can significantly degrade overall performance. I have a few tidbits to add:\r\n\r\n* Disabling the Nagle algorithm in the java driver was a huge performance win for YCSB. We should look into either doing this for the other drivers or be more careful about how we fill packets.\r\n* I read somewhere in the protobuf documentation that the python protobuf lib ships with alternative serializer implemented as a C extension. We should try to turn this on and look at similar options for other drivers. I believe @danielmewes had great success with such a C extension based protobuf serializer for PHP."
