      "Currently in next, there is zero support for IPv6.  The appearance that --join appears to handle it is more of a parsing error.\r\n\r\nThat said, IPv6 support is implemented and up in code review 968.  Sadly this didn't make it into 1.10, but as long as no major bugs are found in the implementation, it should make it into 1.11."
