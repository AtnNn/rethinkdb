        "For very large tables, it would be great if the dump and restore commands would support multiple threads/clients.  At a minimum, the ability to do a separate thread for each shard of a table, and ideally the ability to chunk up the table export/import with any number of concurrent threads.\r\n\r\nPerhaps by default it could check for shard counts and use that many threads, and have an option for X threads and first get the count of documents in the table, and splitting the workload across those threads?"
