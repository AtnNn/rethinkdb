It would make sure that `val` is transcoded into a constant datum, rather than a term. If `val` contains anything that is not constant, it should fail.\r\n\r\nIt could be implemented completely on the client side, or with server support.\r\nIf we implement it on the server, it might be useful to still stop the client from evaluating any lambda functions that might be nested in `val`."
