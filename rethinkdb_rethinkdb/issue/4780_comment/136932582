      "See PR #4784. I had to implement it as a separate method, which is annoying. We could have a single method again if we changed the existing callback-style `cursor.each()` to work like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncursor.each(function (row) {\r\n  // existing `callback` argument\r\n}, function (err) {\r\n  // existing `onFinishedCallback` argument\r\n  // `err == null` if all rows were read from the cursor\r\n});\r\n```"
