      "I agree, basically `cursor.each(...)` should behave the same as `bluebird`'s [`Promise.each(...)`](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md#eachfunction-iterator---promise). In addition to what @jorrit mentioned, if you return a promise from the `each` callback, that promise should be resolved before continuing iteration."
