      "I actually ran into this while fixing https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4068 and fixed it in the same code review (i.e. `return_changes: true` no longer returns changes on an error, but `return_changes: 'always' does).  It should be fixed when 2.0.2 is released.\r\n\r\nThanks for the catch!"
