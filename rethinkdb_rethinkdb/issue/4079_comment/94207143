      "Hi @dlee, the reason why this doesn't work is because the \"id\" and \"name\" fields contain a string in your case, while `count` in ReQL is only defined on arrays.\r\nWe might change this in the future (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/264 ), but at the moment you can use the following work-around to find out the length of a string:\r\n```\r\nr.table('users').filter(r.row('name').split(\"\").count().lt(3))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `split(\"\")` splits the name string into an array of individual characters, which you can then count. Note that this can become a bit slow for large strings, but it's the best option currently available."
