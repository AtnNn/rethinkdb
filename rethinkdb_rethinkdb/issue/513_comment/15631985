      "You can test / play with this in the `apiscroll` branch of `rethinkdb-www`. Scrolling is seamless and works perfectly, but there's a Backbone / event bindIng issue I'm trying to sort out when you switch languages (and the view gets rebuilt).\r\n\r\nIt's proving to be fairly pernicious in tracking down and debugging, so I might need to pair-program it with @neumino to get a second set of eyes on it."
