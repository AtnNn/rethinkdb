        "On a two server cluster, I observed the following behavior on `raft`:\n1. Create a table and insert some data (e.g. 1 M rows, must be enough for backfilling to take a while)\n2. Configure the table to two replicas\n3. The table will remain ready for writes while the backfill is going on.\n4. Now shut down and restart both servers.\n5. The table will now show in `table_status` with `\"ready_for_writes\": false`. However writing to the table actually appears to be working, so this just seems to be a case of `table_status` being wrong.\n\nI have the _debug_table_status output for this table, but it had 16 shards and the output is pretty long. I'll try to reproduce this with a simpler configuration later.\n\nThis is not super critical because only the status appears to be inaccurate.\n"
