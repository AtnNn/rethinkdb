        "Currently, `r.http` with `result_format='auto'` looks for some known binary content-types and returns a String if the content-type of the page isn't among them. The issue with this is that we don't allow Strings to have null bytes in them. It's possible for a content-type to miss our heuristic for finding binary files and to be returned as a string improperly. This throws an avoidable exception and prevents the user from doing what they want to do.\n\nFollowing the discussion on rethinkdb/docs#467, I think we should do one of these two things:\n1. Validate the page content as utf-8, and only if it validates return a String (otherwise return a Binary).\n2. If utf-8 validation turns out to be too slow in practice, switch from white-listing binary content-types to white-listing content-types that are utf-8. The default return type of `r.http` would become a Binary, and only white-listed content-types would return a String.\n\nThe downside of approach 1 is that we'd need to add code to do utf-8 validation, and that it may be slow. The downside of 2 is that it may be surprising to users that some content type comes back as a binary because we didn't explicitly white-list it.\n"
