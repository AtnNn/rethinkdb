      "Comparing with yesterday's last commit sounds more useful. It gives us a more direct feedback about recent changes.\r\nIf we improve one thing early during a release's development, we will have great green numbers for the rest of the development time, even though some later change might have made things worse (as long as they are still better than the previous release).\r\n\r\nComparing to the previous stable release is something that's most important during pre-release QA, and then it can be done manually through the `compare.py` script."
