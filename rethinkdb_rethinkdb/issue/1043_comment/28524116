      "I could improve this further in the meantime and scalability in the number of tables is now extremely close to linear.\r\nUnfortunately the scalability in the number of nodes in a cluster is still abysmal. It has improved by a significant factor as a side-effect of the optimizations I've done, but it still does not scale at all! I'm currently working on a solution. Going to open a separate issue for that though.\r\n\r\nOnce the scalability issues are resolved, the next step will be to run benchmarks with an increased number of hash shards. If they give positive overall results, we can bump up the number of hash shards and close this issue."
