      "We know why the directory system gets slow, having more hash shards increases its size linearly. #364 will help decrease this by a constant factor but the directory is basically always going to grow linearly with the number of hash shards.\r\n\r\nHowever if I recall correctly we choose this number of hash shards to optimize disk usage."
