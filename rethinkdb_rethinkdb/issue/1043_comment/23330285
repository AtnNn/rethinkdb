      "@mlucy you can just bump the number of hash shards here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/reactor/reactor.hpp#L19\r\n\r\nHowever, be careful! The problem here isn't just memory usage. Increasing the cpu shard factor also increases the size of the directory, which in turns makes any meta operations on the cluster unusably slow. If we bump this number, we'll have to fix directory syncing performance issue first, which is non-trivial. You might want to stare at the relevant code with @jdoliner and @Tryneus for a while, to see what's actually doable."
