      "@danielmewes clustering is aware of hash shards because it routes traffic directly to the hash shard it wants to use rather than to a single thread which then distributes the data to different threads. This is actually a pretty nice design because it makes things simpler and is much more performant since the work of reading data off of a socket is spread between multiple threads and there's no need to switch threads to respond to queries.\r\n\r\nWhy don't you try turning the hash shards up to 24 and running it under a profiler. You'll need to have multiple machines running of course to see the effects of the clustering slow down."
