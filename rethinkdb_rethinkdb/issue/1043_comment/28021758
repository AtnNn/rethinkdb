      "I've done some optimizations (mostly avoiding unnecessary copying of metadata) and directory updates now scale a lot better with increasing numbers of tables (which I think is essentially equivalent to increasing the number of hash shards?). It still looks slightly super-linear, and I'm not sure where exactly that is coming from.\r\n![metadata updates old vs new](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/505365/1497463/a480c7a0-480e-11e3-9039-d20e02b65043.png)\r\n\r\nNext up: check how meta operations scale when increasing the number of nodes in the cluster."
