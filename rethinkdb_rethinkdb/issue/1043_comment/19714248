      "My personal opinion is that both RAM and even more so disk size issues are an absolutely bad reason for keeping this number small. We are talking about the worse utilization of internal btree nodes in a small table aren't we?\r\n\r\nIf some metadata operations scale quadratically or worse, then that is a very good reason. We should figure out why they do so then.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner: Would you mind giving me a short hint for why the clustering has to be aware of hash-shards? For all I know, a hash-sharded btree can be made to behave just like a single one to the outside. But obviously I must be forgetting something here."
