      "> We know why the directory system gets slow, having more hash shards increases its size linearly.\r\n\r\nYes, but it appears that the speed of meta operations growth as a function of the directory size and it's a non-linear function. Tim did some work on this and alleged that the function is quadratic or even cubic, but he didn't have enough time to figure out the real cause.\r\n\r\n> However if I recall correctly we choose this number of hash shards to optimize disk usage.\r\n\r\nMy recollection is that we did it strictly to speed up the meta operations, not to optimize disk usage."
