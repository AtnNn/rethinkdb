      "Gotcha -- from eye balling my tables it appears that any table created in 1.15 appears with hard durability -- for pre-1.15, it appears that tables created with a pkey other than 'id' allows you to set the durability to 'soft'...however, if the pkey is the default 'id', then specifying durability has no effect.\r\n\r\nAgain, these are just my observations but might a good place to start looking."
