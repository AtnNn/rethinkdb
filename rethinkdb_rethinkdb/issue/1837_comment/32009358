      "Do we know that this actually causes problems? I'd strongly advise at least running a node profiler (e.g. like this one -- http://blog.nodejs.org/2012/04/25/profiling-node-js/)  to first see what's going on. If my C intuition applies to Node, looping through as few as seven elements may not actually be slower than a hash."
