      "@squarism -- talked to some people, rethink now compiles on maverick in a branch, awaiting code review before it can be merged into next. Issue #121 will address the RHEL/CentOS compilation issues. The current branch turns off warnings with a pragma -- if you do that, you should be able to build on RHEL (you might also need to pass LEGACY_LINUX=1 and NO_EPOLL=1 to Make). Closing this one."
