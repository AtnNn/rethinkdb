      "I'm having the same issue in CentOS 6.3 (the latest as of right now).  The kernel is 2.6.32-279.el6.x86_64.  So I guess RPM systems would be out until a new kernel 2.6.37+ comes out as an update.  You could roll your own kernel but RPM based systems probably aren't going to do that.\r\n\r\nIs there some other RPM distro you were targeting?"
