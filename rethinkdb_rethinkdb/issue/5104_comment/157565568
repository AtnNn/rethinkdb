      "@subblue Oh that makes sense actually. Indexes exported from a more recent version such as 2.2.x are usually not compatible with older versions of RethinkDB (2.1.x and older). I didn't think about that.\r\n\r\nOur error message seems to be pretty bad though. It looks like the server is terminating the connection rather than returning a useful error on the failed `indexCreate` query.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus do you have an idea what's going on? Could it be that we're not handling the case where `indexCreate` receives a version that's too high?"
