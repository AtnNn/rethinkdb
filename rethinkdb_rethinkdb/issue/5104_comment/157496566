      "That's pretty strange.\r\n\r\nCan you make sure that you have the latest version of the Python driver installed on your local machine (`sudo pip install --upgrade rethinkdb`)? The `rethinkdb restore` script is actually packaged with the Python driver.\r\n\r\nYou mention that it does still create the tables. If you leave the tables after the first run, do you get the same error again when you run `rethinkdb restore` a second time? If not, do you get a different error?\r\n\r\nCould you also try the `--clients 1` option, just in case there's an issue with the high load during restore?"
