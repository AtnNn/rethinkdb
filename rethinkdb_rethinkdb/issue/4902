        "My immediate use case is to be informed of whether a given rethinkdb instance has become the leader, however this could potentially be useful for other cases. Temporarily I can set up a change feed on the logs table and filter for the term \"Raft\", however a more direct means would be ideal. \n\nThough this was discussed briefly on the mailing list, no actual proposal was put forth. If this was something as simple as exposing a key like \"raft_role\" maybe on the `server_status` table (it looks like here: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/administration/servers/server_status.cc#L40), then I could totally put together a PR for that, however I wanted to open up the issue here first to discuss potentially better alternatives (or interest in the first place!).\n"
