      "This is the expected behavior, the response field has type `repeated Datum` it's not supposed to be an array. I think this is actually what we want since it makes it very easy for a driver developer to return the first result without parsing all of the results.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this because it's the intended behavior and I don't think we're planning to change this behavior right now. People should feel free to reopen if I'm wrong."
