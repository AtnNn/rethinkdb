      "*Actually* it looks like the full error message is \"http request speaking HTTP to HTTPS\r\nport!? \". I wonder why it's not getting printed completely.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it went away when I switches to a different port. I probably have a browser tab open somewhere that tries to connect via HTTP to the port...\r\n\r\nI might add some special handling for this particular error code to make the error message nicer."
