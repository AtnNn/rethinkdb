        "We currently limit multi-indexes to 256 values per row.  This is a limit that can be hit pretty easily in the real world.  I think we should change our key format in the near(ish) future to use 2 or 4 bytes to store the multi-index tag rather than 1.\n\nThis would also give us a good answer to questions like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30184818/rethinkdb-text-search .\n\n@danielmewes, any thoughts?\n"
