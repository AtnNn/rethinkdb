      "I have identified part of the problem. The .o file gets generated but the\r\n.d file does not. In your folder,\r\n\r\nbuild/debug_clang/obj/rdb_protocol/pb_server.o exists\r\n\r\nbut build/debug_clang/obj/rdb_protocol/pb_server.d does not.\r\n\r\nBecause there is no .d file, make does not know that pb_server.hpp is a\r\ndependency of pb_server.cc\r\n\r\nThe same invocation of $CXX generates both files. There must be a bug in\r\nccache, distcc or clang that causes the .d file not to be generated.\r\n\r\n\r\n2013/9/13 Etienne Laurin <atnnn@rethinkdb.com>\r\n\r\n> Can you recreate make_broken_rethinkdb with the original timestamps?\r\n> (using cp -a instead or cp -r)\r\n>\r\n> Otherwise make decides to rebuild everything.\r\n>\r\n> Thanks.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> 2013/9/13 srh <notifications@github.com>\r\n>\r\n>> Got it again.
