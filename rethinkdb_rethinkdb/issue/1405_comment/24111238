      "That worries me a little. This kind of behaviour is the reason I did not\r\nmake recc the default compiler on newton.\r\n\r\nIf you still have it, or if it happens again, can you send me the full\r\noutput of make? And if possible the output of the previous make as well?\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this happens because the build environment is different\r\non newton. All distcc servers have the exact same environment, but newton\r\nis different.\r\n\r\n\r\n2013/9/7 srh <notifications@github.com>\r\n\r\n> With ./configure CXX=recc --enable-drivers, after building succesfully, I\r\n> made some changes and then recompiled, and the recompile worked.\r\n>\r\n> Then, later, after a git clean -fxd, C++ build errors happened.\r\n>\r\n> \8212\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub<https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1405>\r\n> .\r\n>"
