        "Reported by @nergdron https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1885#issuecomment-42215527 : \n\n> Unfortunately, after leaving the replication running over the weekend, it's now dropped to a very unstable rate of 50-450 writes/s (centered around 250/s) and is behaving very erratically. After 3 days, it has only completed 747340/2730617 blocks. So, it doesn't appear like this problem is resolved in the latest 1.12 releases.\n\nI can reproduce similar replication rates on deadshot (one of our servers).\n# 2392 describes a possible solution, at least a partial one.\n"
