Why? Because many people add datetime fields to secondary indexes and compound primary ids and it's a pain sometimes to fit the index byte limit.\nAlso, this could help the document squeeze into the 250 bytes limit to share the same memory block with others: https://rethinkdb.com/docs/memory-usage/#internal-metadata\n"
