        "To repeat the problem:\n\n``` javascript\n// Run in window 1.\nr.tableCreate('user')\n// Run in window 2.\nr.table('user').orderBy({ index: r.desc('id') }).limit(100).changes().slice(5, 10)\n\n// Run in window 1, repeat 10 times and insert 10 records. Change feed works expected in window 2 \nr.table('user').insert({ name: 'foo' })\n// Run in window 1. Change feed closed and does not work in window 2 \nr.table('user').delete()\n```\n\nI have tested this on linux and osx, and have the same result, change feed upaded and works as expected when inserting data, but closed when you deleting more than 5 records. Is it intended or am I doing it wrong? Thanks.\n\nP.S, the following alternative works:\n\n``` javascript\nr.table('user').orderBy({ index: r.desc('id') }).limit(10).changes().skip(5)\n```\n"
