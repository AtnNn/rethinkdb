      "Ah, that's right, `group` also supports an index optarg that isn't specified in those instructions. (You might want to check out the API docs if you haven't seen them already -- http://rethinkdb.com/api/python/group/)\r\n\r\nHowever, commands like `max` and `avg` don't accept an index, so the protocol docs for those are right.\r\n\r\n/cc @mlucy "
