      "Hello @jmdobry \r\n\r\nFirst, we are sorry for all the inconvenience the changes we made can produce. We are also aware that this involves some work for people maintaining libraries like reheat. We really appreciate your work, and will try our best to stop making breaking changes as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nTo answer your questions, the changes for the syntax of `run` is backward compatible and it is safe to update the driver to 1.12 in your `package.json` file. The only thing that can happen is that the user will see a deprecation warning (it gets printed only once though).\r\n\r\nIf you run into a bug/crash, feel free to open a GitHub issue, and I'll make sure to fix it -- but as far as I have tested it, the 1.12 driver works with the 1.11 and 1.12 server (like your tests show too).\r\nThe internal message sent to open the connection did not change.\r\n\r\nIf you have more questions, let me know."
