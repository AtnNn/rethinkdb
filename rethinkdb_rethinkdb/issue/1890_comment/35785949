      "Err, I don't think silently supporting an old, misguided function signature is a good idea. At the very least we should change the signature in the docs, and have the old signature in a deprecated example.\r\n\r\nI think we have different people with different philosophies on compatibility, and it's hurting us because there is no coherent approach throughout the whole product. We need to make a decision on #1960 and stick to it everywhere. I don't think we should do this before the release, but it's really important for all of us to commit to a single approach. Let's talk about it together once 1.12 is out."
