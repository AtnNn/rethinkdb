      "Thanks for the insert tip, now on the proposal, just to be thorough, if think this construct is super useful, delete should also have this, suppose i have an array of documents i want to delete, ``` r.table('posts').delete([{},{},{}]) ```   that's a clear statement and nicer then constructing a query that fetches those specific documents so i can delete, usually from the client i already \"have\" those documents, this make for a quite straight forward way of telling rethink i need those deleted, the same argument holds true for replacing or inserting (that wisely implements this)."
