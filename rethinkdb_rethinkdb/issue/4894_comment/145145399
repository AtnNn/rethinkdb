      "One potentially bad thing about that `delete` syntax is that it degrades badly when given no arguments.\r\nImagine someone writes code that looks like this:\r\n`r.table('posts').delete(r.args(ids_to_delete))`\r\n\r\nUsually this will delete all documents with the ids in the `ids_to_delete` array. However if the array is empty, it will suddenly delete the whole table which is unexpected and dangerous.\r\n\r\nWe can avoid that edge case by making `delete` take an actual array rather than being variadic, more like in @Agamennon first proposal:\r\n```\r\nr.table('posts').delete([key1, key2, ...])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen passed an empty array, `delete` will delete nothing.\r\n\r\nThis is also consistent with how `insert` accepts multiple documents."
