        "We purposely don't incorporate automatic startup into the installer, despite it being standard practice with server debian packages. The idea behind this is to make the product really nice for developers, and we always found automatic installations fairly uncomfortable from the developer perspective.\n\nWe should add an installer script that places rethinkdb in upstart. Essentially it should automate the steps described here: http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guides/startup/\n"
