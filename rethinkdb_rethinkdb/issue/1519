        "Running rethinkdb on a set of Dell blades.\r\nGot some dual port 10Gbit addon cards with SFP+ direct connect copper cables from blade to blade, and dual copper 1Gbit onboard, all intel.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if interfaces is set to 'all', the first routable interface (lowest metric) is used for traffic. In my case, it's the onboard gigabit ethernet ports, and traffic flows across my switch instead of the dedicated interconnects, which are exposed via br1.\r\n\r\nThere are several other use cases that will deal with how sockets are bound to ports on interfaces, such as exposing the web interface on a VLAN interface while clustering across a 10Gbit addon card, while exposing the driver port to the localhost interface only, or providing a unix socket path instead of a TCP receive socket.\r\n\r\nSupport for Systemd's socket activation may further embedded usage in various projects like CoreOS.\r\n\r\nRelying on iptables to handle all of this for you may be tempting, but it feels like using a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito for us users, when a handful of configuration options that accepts a comma delimited list of interfaces would obsolete several pages of potentially complex iptables rule ordering and unintended blunders like -I instead of -A or vice versa.\r\n\r\nPreferably in the future, iptables should be resorted to only if you have a truly complex configuration you, the all-seeing all-knowing senior system administrator, require to express.\r\n\r\nLove the elegance, simplicity, and flexibility elsewhere; so this little sore spot could use the Rethink magic too.
