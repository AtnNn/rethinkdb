      "@wereHamster sent me his data and I could reproduce the slowness. Profiling shows that this is indeed due to data deserialization overhead.\r\n\r\n@wereHamster Thank you for the report and your assistance in finding the cause of it. I'm going to close this issue in favor of #1915 which we hope to solve in RethinkDB version 1.15."
