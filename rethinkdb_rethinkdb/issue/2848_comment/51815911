The server has 64GB RAM and there are roughly 30k documents of less than 5k each.(about 150MB if my math is right).\r\n\r\nI did run the query multiple times back to back, the performance didn't improve.\r\n\r\nI can get you the full table dump (~7.2k documents) and the query if you think it would help you track this down."
