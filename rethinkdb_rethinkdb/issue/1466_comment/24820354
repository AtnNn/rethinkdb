      "Hi Alex,\r\n\r\nWe've talked before about having something better than `left` and `right` here, but the problem is that joins in ReQL are very general, and it's hard to come up with reasonable autogenerated names.\r\n\r\nFor instance, you can join a table with itself, e.g. `r.table('people').eq_join('spouse', r.table('people'))` -- what do you name the fields then?\r\n\r\nOr, as another example, you can have any stream on the lefthand side of a join -- there's no rule against writing `r.union(r.table('new_links'), r.table('old_links')).eq_join(...)`.\r\n\r\nMoving to backlog, since the next few releases are going to be mostly performance and stability fixes; we'll come back to this API when we start looking at new QL improvements.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion!"
