      "Thanks for reporting this @dineyw23 .\r\n\r\nThis is weird, since 1) OpenSSL 1.0.2 should be compatible as far as I know and 2) It's failing during linking rather than compiling, which means that the missing functions were present in the OpenSSL headers but not in the actual library.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's linking against a different OpenSSL library than what it's compiling with. I can see that OpenSSL 1.0.2h is installed in `/usr/local` on your system.\r\n\r\n@dineyw23 The easiest way to work around this is probably adding `--fetch openssl` to your `./configure` flags and then recompiling.\r\n\r\n@larkost Could it be that we're using the OpenSSL includes from /usr/local/include because the OpenSSL that comes with OS X doesn't have any include files, and then link against the system OpenSSL because it comes earlier in the library path?"
