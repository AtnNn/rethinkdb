      "@danielmewes: I think you have the problem diagnosed correctly: the OpenSSL 1.0.2 headers are the only one in the resolution path (because El Capitan removes the system OpenSSL headers), but the binary for the system version is ahead of the `/usr/local` in the resolution order, so it grabs that one.\r\n\r\nSince this sort of case is more possible since Apple removed those headers, I wonder if we should try anything to make sure that things match? There are going to be lots of edge cases, but it might prevent some problems."
