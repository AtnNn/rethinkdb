        "It looks like the Python driver can't correctly handle objects that have the key 'self' in them as it conflicts with the `__init__` method's self parameter.  Here's a piece of test code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport rethinkdb as r\r\nconn = r.connect(\"127.0.0.1\", 28015)\r\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"test\").insert({\"self\": \"woot\"}).run(conn)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's the traceback output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"import.py\", line 10, in <module>\r\n    r.db(\"test\").table(\"test\").insert({\"self\": \"woot\"}).run(conn)\r\n  File \"/home/mfenniak/Development/github/venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rethinkdb/ast.py\", line 513, in insert\r\n    return Insert(self, records, upsert=upsert)\r\n  File \"/home/mfenniak/Development/github/venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rethinkdb/ast.py\", line 11, in __init__\r\n    self.args = [expr(e) for e in args]\r\n  File \"/home/mfenniak/Development/github/venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rethinkdb/query.py\", line 19, in expr\r\n    return MakeObj(**val)\r\nTypeError: __init__() got multiple values for keyword argument 'self'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error seems to occur with 'self' as a top-level key, and also as a key inside any embedded object as well.
