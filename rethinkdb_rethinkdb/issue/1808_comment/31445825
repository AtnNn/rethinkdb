      "@coffeemug i think this is something that has to be done in chuncks first figuring out what you currently log and what u dont log and not just what gets logged onto the admin ui but what also gets logged into text files. Then catgorizing it. Then followed by being allowed to enable or disable my level or category not sure what you like more. Finally once its ogrinized then figuring out what not being logged becomes easy. \"what logs were visable based on the ticket that was just opened\", \"would more logs or more verbosity have helped this ticket be solved easier\" "
