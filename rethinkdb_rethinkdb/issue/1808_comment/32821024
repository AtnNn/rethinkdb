      "@coffeemug i am thinking that it could be intresting if in the config file users would be able to log gc steps and times.   Right now i am having a back fill that keeps getting slow and slower but the disk io is staying high. (already checked iotop and it says rethinkdb is using the io). My guess its the gc running. But no way for me to know.\r\n\r\nTicket for the backfill issue is #1885 "
