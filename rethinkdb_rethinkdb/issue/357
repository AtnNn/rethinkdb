        "Here are some unintuitive things I bumped into when using the RethinkDB web UI.\n- I keep trying to click the \"Connected to\", \"Issues\", \"Servers\", and \"Datacenters\" icons in the second row.\n- When there are issues, and the issues banner has a little arrow pointing at the \"Issues\" icon, I first thought I should click on the \"Issues\" icon. Ideally, the design should draw the eye towards the \"Resolve Issues\" button on the right instead.\n- On the page for a specific table, in the \"Servers used by this table\" section, \"Unassigned servers\" sounds like it's a list of servers that aren't used by the table. Consider changing it to \"Servers in no datacenter\" or something.\n- In the table-list view, when I click the stack of documents next to the table name, it checks the check box. Is that intentional? Maybe it should take me to the page for that table instead.\n- When declaring a server dead, the UI should explain to the user what it means to declare a server dead, and warn them about the potential dangers. In particular, the UI doesn't mention that declaring a server dead is irreversible.\n\nOverall I really like it, though. Also, the replication progress UI is really neat.\n"
