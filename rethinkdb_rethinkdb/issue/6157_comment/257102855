      "@mcjp78 When you add code to an existing codebase you will want to match the existing conventions so all your code looks and reads the same as all the code around it. Doing so will make the codebase one cohesive unit. You'll find this in every open source project, and the majority of closed source projects as well.\r\n\r\nI believe RethinkDB has an official style guide though I'm not sure it is public at the moment. In lieu of an official style guide, it should be easy to match the other code already existing in the repository."
