      "@srh Current Java driver has a limited ability do map values provided by DB (basically a JSON)  to Java objects (you don't wan to marshall/demarshall data coming/going to DB by hand, right?). \r\n\r\nThis patch would provide a much better mapping abilities, as provided by Jackson, IMO the best JSON-to-Java-object mapper there is. So this is a good patch that would provide a much better functionality.\r\n\r\nHowever, this will change current API (the data returned/sent to driver will be different) and will break things for current users. As a basic rule minor updates should not change API contract, even major updates should be backwards compatible.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to make this optional via a config setting and announce this change, than later change make it default when major number is bumped."
