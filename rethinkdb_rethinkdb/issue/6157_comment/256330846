      "@PeterKnego I'm a bit torn on this. So in an ideal world, we'd be backwards compatible for a while. In practice though, this is a big maintenance burden and obviously now there's less manpower available for it.\r\n\r\nGiven that Jackson is better at this stuff than the hand-rolled system we have now, I think it's reasonable to replace it, even if it results in some small changes in client code."
