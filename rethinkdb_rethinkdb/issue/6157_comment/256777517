      "> However, this will change current API (the data returned/sent to driver will be different) and will break things for current users.\r\n\r\nMy understanding was that the Java driver was still kind of in beta. It's also relatively new, and missing features like async responses which means that many people aren't able to adopt it. I suspect that the number of people who would be affected *and* wouldn't have the engineering resources to update this would be low.\r\n\r\n> As a basic rule minor updates should not change API contract, even major updates should be backwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThat's a good general principle, but may not work with the RethinkDB drivers, as they are versioned against the RethinkDB version, rather than using semver on their own. The RethinkDB protocol is also very stable and RethinkDB is backwards compatible with older protocols, so there is nothing stopping people from relying on the older driver while they migrate.\r\n\r\nEspecially considering the reduced manpower available for RethinkDB, anything that can reduce maintenance burden is a big win in my book."
