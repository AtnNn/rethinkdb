      "I thought that Javadoc comments don't mean anything (to the Javadoc tool) inside a function body.  At least a quick google suggested that.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of a Java-specific RethinkDB style guide, but having the statements in a block be at the same level of indentation is a more or less universal standard for the same reason that they're indented in the first place.  Regarding spacing between tokens, one of the following happens:  Somebody goes and cleans it up later, polluting git blame history.  Or, before that, somebody reading the code will see the weird style, think to themselves, \"Oh what is up with this, I better check this out,\" and start scrutinizing it for quality problems.  So now they're doing work that doesn't need to be done, because of a false bad code smell.  Good code should smell good, so that bad-smelling code is a more reliable signal."
