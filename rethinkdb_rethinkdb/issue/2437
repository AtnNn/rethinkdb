        "With changefeeds:\n\n``` ruby\n# Blocks until there is a first change\nc = r.table('foo').changes.run\n```\n\nThe fact that this command blocks is quite confusing when using it interactively. It would feel much better if the server would return an empty batch and the client driver returned the cursor immediately. Then calling `next` on the cursor should block, not returning the cursor itself.\n\n/cc @mlucy \n"
