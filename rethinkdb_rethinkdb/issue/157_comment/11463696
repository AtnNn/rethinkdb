      "The thing is there's no way to enforce the restriction that output and input types are the same because we don't have a type system. Implicit restrictions that are unenforceable are how we got here in the first place. And I'm convinced they're a pretty bad idea in general. Having this as an implicit restriction allows people to write functions which work sometimes but then break when they happen to only have one element in their dataset."
