      "The two languages I know that are dynamic and have reduce are Common Lisp and Ruby, and both let you provide an optional base case, but don't require it.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nirb(main):6685:0> [].reduce(0) {|a,b| a+b}    \r\n0                                             \r\nirb(main):6686:0> [].reduce {|a,b| a+b}       \r\nnil                                           \r\nirb(main):6687:0> [1].reduce(0) {|a,b| a+b}   \r\n1                                             \r\nirb(main):6688:0> [1].reduce {|a,b| a+b}      \r\n1                                             \r\nirb(main):6689:0> [1, 2].reduce(0) {|a,b| a+b}\r\n3                                             \r\nirb(main):6690:0> [1, 2].reduce {|a,b| a+b}   \r\n3                                             \r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know how Python does it, but if it's extremely non-Pythonic to omit the base case we could just enforce that it's present in the Python driver.\r\n\r\nI think we should take an optional base case, and have the semantics Bill suggested when people don't provide it (returning NULL on an empty stream and returning the only element of a one-element stream).  This is easier for 99% of cases, and also what I expect based on Ruby's reduce."
