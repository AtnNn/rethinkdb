      "Defining a reduction on an empty array as `null` isn't an option because it's something that could be returned by the reduction function. People could write a reduction function which returns `null` sometimes but if I'm understanding your proposal correctly we would then convert that in to the same value they'd get should they pass in an empty array. Which is not going to be what they expect. Similarly returning just the single element from a one element stream isn't correct either consider the following function:\r\n\r\n    >>> ([{\"users\" : 1}]).reduce(lambda x,y: branch(type(y) == \"object\", x + y[\"users\"], x + y).run()\r\n    {\"users\" : 1}\r\n    >>> ([{\"users\" : 1}]).reduce(lambda x,y: branch(type(y) == \"object\", x + y[\"users\"], x + y, base = 0).run()\r\n    1\r\n\r\nNotice that adding an optional base which to the user seems like an identity element actually changes the result of the reduction which is very confusing. \r\n\r\nI'd also like to point out that of the examples you give:\r\n\r\n    >>> r([]).reduce(lambda a,b: a+b, base=0).run()\r\n\r\nWhich is the proposed syntax is the shortest, and could also be even shorter since you don't need the `base` keyword there.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to point out that reduce in Python Ruby and Javascript all take bases so I think taking one will be the least confusing thing for developers."
