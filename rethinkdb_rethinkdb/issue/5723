        "Elasticsearch has the concept of [index templates](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/indices-templates.html) which allow you to automatically apply configuration when new indices are created. I think it would be really nice to have something similar in RethinkDB.\n\nThe templates could be stored in a new system table, perhaps `config_templates`. This example would probably be the most common use-case. Ensuring all tables in your cluster are created with the same number of shards and replicas by default:\n\n``` js\n{\n  \"db\": \"*\",\n  \"table\": \"*\",\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"shards\": 3,\n    \"replicas\": 3\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe next example illustrates how this could be useful for dynamically created tables. In this case, we have tables acting as queues. Each time we create a new table in `job_queues`, it will automatically have a standard configuration applied:\n\n``` js\n{\n  \"db\": \"job_queues\",\n  \"table\": \"*\",\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"primary_key\": \"job_id\"\n  },\n  \"indexes\": [{\n    \"index\": \"status\"\n    \"function\": r.row('status'),\n    \"multi\": false,\n    \"geo\": false\n  }],\n  \"grant\": [{\n    \"username\": \"job_handler\",\n    \"read\": true,\n    \"write\": true\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nNote that it's possible for multiple config templates to be applied when a table is created. Order should be deterministic, probably based on the specificity of `db/table` names in the template. Options passed directly into `dbCreate` and `tableCreate` would have the highest priority.\n"
