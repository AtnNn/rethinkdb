        "Right now we have lots of `checkOpen` calls in the Java driver ConnectionInstance class. This is a leftover from basically copying the python driver's implementation 1-1. A more java-esque way to do this would be to have a ConnectionInstanceBuilder that ensures you can't have a null socket inside a ConnectionInstance once it's created. The connection already destroys connectionInstances whenever it detects the socket is closed, so there's no real reason to have the ConnectionInstance be tolerant of missing sockets."
