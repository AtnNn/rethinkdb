        "The messages we write to the log file could be nicer, particularly the table-related ones. In no particular order:\r\n\r\n* Maybe we shouldn't log Raft elections; they're a lot of noise and maybe not meaningful to some users. But if the table is repeatedly trying to run elections and failing that can be a useful signal.\r\n\r\n* When we log table-related events we currently just log the UUID. It would be nice to log `db.name` instead or in addition.\r\n\r\n* We currently log table-related events on the server that implements them, but some context is missing at that point. Maybe we should log them on the server that initiates the operation, where we can provide more specific detail.\r\n\r\n* Maybe we should print a list of all the tables to the log file at server startup."
