      "Sorry about the delay on this, got side-tracked by a bunch of other things while performing tests to try to reproduce this.  It appears that secondary index updates can indeed be stopped by a well-timed interruptor, which would result in inconsistent data between the two trees (easy way to check is that table.count() is not the same as the number of rows gettable by sindex).  In order to avoid this situation, I've removed interruption from sindex updates, which should ensure that sindexes are always up-to-date.  This may slow down resharding and shutdown during traffic, but I think this is necessary.  This is up for review in 577."
