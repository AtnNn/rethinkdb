      "It could be a quick fix to keep this crash from happening, but I'm not sure we won't just be covering up some underlying bug.  I've been trying some more extensive tests to check if there may be side effects, but have not been able to reproduce this.  Next I'll be implementing a unit test that interrupts an rdb_protocol_t::point_replace_t at different points to make sure there are no holes in the secondary index logic.  (I'm thinking that this issue was related to a write being interrupted by the resharding between updating the primary btree and secondary-index btree, but no proof yet)."
