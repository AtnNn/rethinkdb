        "Basically, for the JS driver, I want to get a connection object immediately from r.connect() (or a similar function) that I can then pass to queries' `.run()`, and it will add the command to the connection promise's `.then` callback.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n``` js\nvar conn = r.connection(cfg.rethinkdb);\nconn.use('example');\nr.insert({stuff:'foo',things:['bar','baz']}).run(conn);\n\n// would work like:\n\nr.connect(cfg.rethinkdb).then(conn => {\n  conn.use('example');\n  r.insert({stuff:'foo',things:['bar','baz']}).run(conn);\n})\n```\n\nRight now, if I want anything like this behavior (where I can return a synchronous value and not have to worry about buffering queries to run after the connection is established), I have to use rethinkdbdash, which has problems (namely, I can't easily use it to run connection-agnostic queries constructed with a module like https://github.com/stuartpb/endex).\n"
