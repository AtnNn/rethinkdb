      "The change I made is probably not helpful in the general case, and might break other people; as I stated, I simply removed the scheme and authority sections, and left only a \"relative\" absolute path (well, first I hardcoded it with my new hostname, but then I decided I wanted something less fragile). The issue comes down to whether or not this code is used for other purposes where the host needs to be configurable.\r\n\r\nRegardless, here is the change (as would be made to the un-minimized version that comes in the source code for httpconnection.js):\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar url = 'http://'+this.host_+':'+this.port_+'/ajax/reql/';\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nvar url = '/ajax/reql/';\r\n```"
