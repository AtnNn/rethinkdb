      "@saurik -- actually one more question, what is the issue with autodetecting port 80 in your setup? The way the system is set up now, if the dataexplorer is accessed via an explicit port, that port will be used in the ajax request, otherwise it enforces port 80. Do you know what about this doesn't work in your setup?"
