      "Hmm, I actually think the easiest thing to do here is just make databases work like datacenters do. That is tables don't have to be in a database they can be in the null database which is where we look if people just do `r.table(\"foo\")` Then we'll have no need to create the \"test\" database on startup and headaches will go away."
