      "Someone just ran into this and I spent a while walking them through it on IRC. This is pretty intuitive to me, but it was *really* confusing for a user. An intuitive workflow for a user is this:\r\n\r\n* Start node A on a VPS, test if they could connect to it with a browser\r\n* Start node B on a VPS, test if they could connect to it with a browser\r\n* Ok, everything works, now restart node B but add a `--join` argument\r\n* Name conflict. What's going on? Go on IRC and spend an hour trying to understand it\r\n\r\nI'd like to reopen this issue. This isn't a super-high priority, but we should fix this to avoid first experience snafus."
