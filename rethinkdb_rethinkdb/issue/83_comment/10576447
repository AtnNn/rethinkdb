      "Agree with everything above, except removing default `test` database. I don't see why we need to do that - what we do now is a pretty good way to be friendly on startup, it doesn't seem to cause issues, and it's how other databases do it. Also, I really don't like the idea of allowing database-less tables. It... offends my sensibilities?"
