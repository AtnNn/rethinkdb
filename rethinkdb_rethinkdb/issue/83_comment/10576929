      "> So I'm really confused, I've seen from you:\r\n\r\nActually, I'm really confused as well. I have absolutely no idea what I meant by \"We have no need to create a `test` database on startup anyway\", except I'm certain I didn't mean that we should just drop it :)\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to understand what the actual problem here is. If you start a node and then join nodes into it, there is no conflict because we don't create a database on joining the cluster in porcelain. If you start two nodes separately, then shut one down and bring it up again with a join, you'll get a conflict, but I think that's desired (although we might want to give a better warning about accidentally joining two clusters). I don't think we should fix anything until we actually know exactly what the issue is."
