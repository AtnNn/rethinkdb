      "@mlucy: I'm not sure what you mean by the call to `caller`. My understanding of Ruby is very limited as you know, but I don't see it getting called in `sanitize_context`, or is it? What I actually did in my change was to basically short-circuit `sanitize_context` to its `else` case. More specifically I replaced calls to `sanitize_context` by the arguments that were passed to it. E.g. I replaced `sanitize_context(caller)` by `caller`.\r\n\r\nWhat definitely showed up in the profile was the `.reject` method which is used in sanitize_context, and a lot of regex matching things that originated from there."
