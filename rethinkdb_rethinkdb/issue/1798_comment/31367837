      "One thing in the Ruby driver that's apparently using quite some CPU is `RPP.sanitize_context`. Commenting the call to it in the function `expr` in shim.rb makes the benchmark run roughly 50% faster. @mlucy: Any thoughts on that?\r\nPS: Also disabling it in rethinkdb.rb's RQL#initialize function adds another 25% or so of throughput."
