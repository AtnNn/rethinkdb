      "@mlucy: I'v profiled the benchmark with ruby-prof (http://ruby-prof.rubyforge.org/).\r\nThe report is in /home/daniel/ruby-bench-ruby-prof.kcachegrind on newton. You can open it witch kcachegrind.\r\nYou can run the benchmark through `ruby /home/daniel/RubyDatabaseBenchmarks/run.rb`, and create a new profile through `ruby /home/daniel/RubyDatabaseBenchmarks/profile.rb`. Both scripts expect a RethinkDB server to be running on newton with port offset 23. They load the Ruby driver from my RethinkDB directory /home/daniel/rethinkdb/drivers/ruby/lib.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the bottleneck is in the protobuffer decoding. Should the Ruby driver be using a compiled/native Protocol Buffer implementation?"
