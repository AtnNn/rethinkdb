      "It's almost certainly the call to `caller` that's slow rather than the call to `sanitize_context`.  (Note that this bottleneck should only appear when you're building queries in a loop rather than building one query and running it repeatedly.)\r\n\r\nI'll try switching it to use `caller_locations` on Monday and see if that's any faster.  If it isn't, we should see if there's a way to capture context lazily (so we only do the expensive call when we need to print it).  If that doesn't work, we should just stop capturing the context by default, which should make the problem go away."
