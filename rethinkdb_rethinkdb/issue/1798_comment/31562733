      "Fixing sanitize_context is pretty easy (up in Review 1101).  When I do so, I get about 320 inserts/second on Newton.  When I switch to using `noreply: true`, I get about 935 inserts/second.  So we're now spending about 2/3 of our time waiting for the server.\r\n\r\nI can do some more optimization work on the Ruby driver if it turns out to still be slower than the others ( @danielmewes -- do you have a sense of how fast the others are? ), but I think at this point optimizing the server would be the best way to improve the iterated-point-insert workload.\r\n\r\n(Also, @danielmewes , `rethink_runner.rb` in the directory you mentioned has you home directory hardcoded into the `$LOAD_PATH`.  You might want to change that.)"
