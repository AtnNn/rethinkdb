        "We have 30-some `.test` files in `./test/rql_test` that are just setup files for actual tests. So we run them from `test-runner`, and they in turn run the actual tests. Mostly these are just to make sure that the actual test file gets run with the desired version of the interpreter (e.g.: `ruby`) that it was written for. A second reason I started writing these was so that you could run the tests outside of the testing harness, a goal that was important at a previous job, but which I have become less convinced is relevant here.\n\nSo the goals for whatever solution presents itself are:\n1. Reduce the number of extra files to simplify management/maintenance.\n2. Make sure that the tests are run in the proper interpreter.\n3. Allow these to only run once per run, rather than being run for each version of the specified interpreter (e.g. `-irb1.9 -irb2.0` should still run only once) since most are not testing the driver/language but rather server behavior.\n4. Still allow specifying an interpreter version for interpreter-version-agnostic tests so we can make sure tests will run (e.g. for the pending Python2.x->3.x shift in various OSs)\n\nNote that this only applies to `.test` files that also specify a language, such as `get_all.rb.test`. Ones that do not specify a language do not have this problem.\n"
