        "Hey guys,\n\nI wasn't able to populate a list of keys while joining on an other table so I was wondering if my models are correct and if what I'm trying to do is possible with Thinky, here is my code:\n\n`Group` model\n\n```\n  var Group = thinky.createModel('group', {\n      users: [thinky.type.string()],\n      place_id: thinky.type.string()\n  });\n```\n\n`User` model\n\n```\n  var User = thinky.createModel('user', {\n      name: thinky.type.string()\n  });\n```\n\n`Place` model\n\n```\n  var Place = thinky.createModel('place', {\n      name: thinky.type.string()\n  });\n  Place.hasMany(Group, \"groups\", \"id\", \"place_id\");\n```\n\nI'd like to fetch all the `groups` with user's name & place's name for a `place_id`\n\nHere is what I've done:\n\n```\nPlace.get(PLACE_ID).getJoin({groups: true}).then(function(g){console.log(g);})\n```\n\nHow can I populate the user's name ? Using `_apply` ? How ?\n\nThank you in advance :)\n"
