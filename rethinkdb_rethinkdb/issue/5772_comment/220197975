      "Thanks for the suggestion @tatsujin1 .\r\n\r\nWe've had some similar discussions before, but as far as I can find we hadn't had an issue for this.\r\n\r\nOne issue with this kind of thing (having a write operation chained onto a changefeed) is that you can easily build infinite loops, where the write triggers another change and thereby gets triggered over and over.\r\n\r\nFor the specific case of TTL we'll probably provide a different framework (though the API you describe would be very nice for it indeed!). I've been wanting to write up a proposal for it for the past week, but have been busy with Horizon-related things. Will try to get to it today or tomorrow."
