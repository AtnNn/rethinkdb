      "Another option is to reject the insert (this is the SQL way).\r\n\r\nIt sounds like a really bad idea to do it for missing attributes (for the same reason erroring on missing attributes is a bad idea elsewhere), but it might be the right thing to do in other cases. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable.sindex_create(lambda x: error('message'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like we should not include the document in the index in `default`/`Nothing` situations, and reject the insert in other error situations. I'm not at all sure this is the desired behavior, but it \"feels\" right (thought it might turn out to be very wrong when we explore the edge cases)."
