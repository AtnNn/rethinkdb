      "I like the idea of using `NULL` as the index best.  That way people could see the rows that didn't evaluate by doing `table.get_all(NULL, :index)`.  Also, then if people index on an attribute, we'll have the same behavior whether that attribute doesn't exist or maps to NULL.  (I think we should do this same thing for arrays; if people index on `[:foo, :bar, :baz]` and `:bar` doesn't exist we'll use `[fooval, NULL, bazval]` as the index.)"
