      "So the issue with rejecting a write is that you also have to reject sindex creation if they already contain a row which errors. This is actually something of a pain so I'd prefer not to do it right now. Also I think it might be kind of annoying if you're spend a few hours creating a sindex and then we throw it out because some row threw an error.  I'm not 100% sure on that but definitely if we can get away with just dropping the row on errors (and maybe reporting that in some way) that would be easiest."
