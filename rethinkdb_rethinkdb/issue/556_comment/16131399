      "I'm not sure we can special case it enough. Right now I'm assuming that we compare by alphabetical type names so NUMBER < NULL < STRING which means that even if someone does `table.between(1, \"foo\", \"sid\")` they're going to get the `null` values as well. I guess we could push `null` all the way over to one side of the ordering and special case a `null` bound to actually mean \"greater than `null`\" but this is all starting to seem weird to me.\r\n\r\nIt also seems really weird for `between(null, null)` to not be a no-op."
