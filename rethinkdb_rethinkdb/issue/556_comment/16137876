      "@al3xandru we definitely could place it outside of ordering rules although with `between` we're normally not doing a reql comparison for each row so it would still take some finagling. My overarching objection is just that it seems very weird to first come up with a special way to include rows in the index for which you can't really compute a value of the index function (putting them in as `null`) and then come up with rules that make sure they don't show up in the index when you use `between`. I feel like this leads to it being kind of hard to have an intuitive notion of exactly what's in the sindex."
