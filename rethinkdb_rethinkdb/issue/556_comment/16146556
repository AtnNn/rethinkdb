      "Sorry I'm a bit late to the party. I think what we've arrived at is cool for sprint-2/1.5 (dropping the row from the index if the function fails). In the long term though, I *think* I'd prefer to implement @mlucy's proposal where we include nulls into the index. My main objection to the approach taken here is that it feels like `t.between(null, null, index='foo').delete()` should leave the table completely empty, whereas dropping rows from the index will have the effect of this operation leaving some rows in the table. I agree with @al3xandru and @jdoliner that we should just wait and see if this is even an issue."
