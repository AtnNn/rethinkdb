      "So the main thing that seems weird to me about using `null` is that it's not immediately obvious to me what happens with between queries. Since we define an ordering across all types, including `null`, unless we do something fancy people are going to get something like this:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n> table.between(5, null, \"sid\")\r\n[{\"sid\" : 6}, { }, { }]\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause `null` compares greater than numbers. That seems really weird to me."
