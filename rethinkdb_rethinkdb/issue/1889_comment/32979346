      "Besides standartizing path there is another problem with python. The version 2 versus version 3 issue. As some distros (like Arch) python points to python3. If the script is python2 specific then it should use ``#!/usr/bin/env python2`` shebang to work properly. Unfortunately ``python2`` does not present on MacOSX macports that I use on test machine. Here is related macports ticket http://trac.macports.org/ticket/38661"
