      "It seems that a block is referenced which is actually not in the LBA (or at least not the in-memory LBA that the serializer has in memory after startup).\r\nThe block ID of the block that's not in the LBA index is 79 (after translation, 19 before translation).\r\n\r\nIn case you want to try reproducing also the potential database corruption: I had 4 shards, with the primaries split between the two servers (2 each, no replication / no secondaries). Then I ran the following stress client configuration:\r\n\r\n    stress -d 21600s -c 32 -q - -w 1/4/8/64/0/0/0/8 --ignore-protocol-errors -s rethinkdb,localhost:28015 -s rethinkdb,localhost:28016"
