      "Well, my speculation about a problem with the backfilling code was due to the fact that the bug only shows for me while replication is being enabled.\r\nMaybe it accesses the b-tree slightly differently than regular (point) updates?\r\nOtherwise, I guess this must be a problem with the b-tree code itself or *shudder* the buffer cache (snapshotting maybe?)?"
