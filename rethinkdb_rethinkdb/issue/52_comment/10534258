      "It's perfectly ok to write random data in release mode -- there is no need to zero it out if the code is correct (other than perhaps to ensure easier debugging later -- but that comes at a cost of performance).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the API should have a guarantee that triggers if the block has been allocated but not written to? (though this isn't an ideal solution, since it doesn't prevent bugs at compile time, which a better API could)."
