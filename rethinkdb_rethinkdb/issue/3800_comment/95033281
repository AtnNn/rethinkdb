      "Because usually the reason you'd want to take advantage of auto-coercion is in code like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.expr(\"I have\").add(x).add(\" cookies and \").add(y).add(\" brownies\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere coercions would be really verbose. (Though without overloaded operators in js, it's pretty verbose even with auto-coercion.)"
