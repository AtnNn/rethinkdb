      "Ok I can see that supporting this can be dangerous.\r\nI think having a special `concat` term would be reasonable generally, but on the other hand the difference between that term and `add` would be difficult to explain since it's so small. So in the end I think that would be a bad idea as well.\r\n\r\nI don't understand how a string formatting term is related to this though? You can already coerce the number to a string."
