      "The problem could be that we call fdatasync, but we don't call fsync in such a way that makes sure the file's actually present in the directory.  Then the file doesn't exist upon startup after the power failure, but the metadata says the table exists, and (perhaps) silently creates the table when it can't find a file for the table."
