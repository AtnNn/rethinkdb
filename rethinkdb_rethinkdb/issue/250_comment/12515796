      "The issue described in the blog post is a little bit different (the author started Rethink as a service, so even if we had a better error message, it wouldn't have solved his problem -- I will address it separately). Nevertheless, fixing this is a good idea. I'd make two changes here:\r\n\r\n1. Move the \"Listening on addresses (add more using '--bind'): 127.0.0.1\" closer to the end, right before \"Server ready\" (or  merge it with server ready message e.g. \"Server ready -- listening on...\"\r\n2. Change the contents of the message to make the *solution* more clear, i.e. instead of saying \"add more using '--bind'\", I'd say \"use '--bind all' to listen on all interfaces\".\r\n\r\nAssigning to @atnnn."
