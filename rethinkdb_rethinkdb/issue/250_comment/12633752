      "I think the solution is good but the text of the message could be improved.\r\n\r\nThe solution is good because if you're running on one machine but are trying to access the server from another, you have no choice but to bind to other network interfaces. We're just being helpful by telling the users exactly what the problem might be and how to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe part where you say \"if you are unable to connect ... try adding\" could be improved by simply fixing the wording. Instead of telling them what to do if they can't connect (e.g. check port, add bind, etc.) you can instead say \"To expose RethinkDB to the network, bind to other network interfaces with '--bind=all'\" (or a similar message). This simultaneously tells them how to fix the problem and informs them that the server will now be accessible remotely. EDIT: I wouldn't warn them about the port here, as it muddles the issue.\r\n\r\nGood catch, btw."
