        "In ql2.proto the STATUS term is described as having the type `Table -> SingleSelection`. I was told that SingleSelection is (OBJECT or NULL), ie. if the object is not found then NULL is returned. However, when I run STATUS on a non-existing table then the server thows an exception. Contrast that to GET which returns NULL if the entry doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nAlso, why should I use STATUS over `r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_status').get('table_name')`? Ignoring the difference in handling non-existing entries, those two seem equivalent."
