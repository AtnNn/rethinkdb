        "### Connection parameter in run()\r\n\r\nIs it really necessary? Can we use the \"default\" connection, saved internally on connect()/reconnect() and use simplified API?\r\n\r\nI changed a few lines in JS driver to store connection as rethinkdb.connection and allow me to use run(conn, callback) as run(callback) instead.\r\n\r\n### Proper events: connect, error, disconnect\r\n\r\nWe really need to know if there is something wrong with connection or if connection has been closed and needs to be reopened.\r\n\r\n### Mongoose-like query calls\r\n\r\nIn Mongoose you can do something like User.find(&lt;search>, &lt;callback>) without need to call exec(). Can we have similar functionality in RDB drivers?\r\n\r\n### Automatic cursor \8594 array conversion\r\n\r\nSometimes you just need a JSON array returned immediately instead of cursor. In Mongoose there is lean() chained method, I think it would be nice to have similar in RDB.\r\n\r\nI can work on these for JavaScript driver as we use RethinkDB in our new project and it seems really promising. But after using MongoDB and Mongoose a lot I find RDB JS API to be less convenient."
