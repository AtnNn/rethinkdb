      "Ouch that is bad. The original crash with the range error would usually indicate a corruption (or incompatiblity) in the persistet metadata or auth data.\r\n\r\nHowever the other crash after clearing `rethinkdb_data` makes me think that something else must be going on. That crash *should* not be possible because the magic value of the secondary index block that it's complaining about is initialized to (hopefully) the right value just a moment before that check.\r\n\r\nI'm going to ask Alex for some additional information on the mailing list.\r\nHe also appears to be running a self compiled RethinkDB binary (at least it seems to have symbols). Maybe it's an incompatiblity with his version of GCC (4.8.2 apparently)?"
