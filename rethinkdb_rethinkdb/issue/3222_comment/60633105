      "@acasanova This shouldn't be a problem. The yum package installs the actual rethinkdb server, while the pip install is for the Python driver which also supplies the `rethinkdb dump` / `rethinkdb restore` functionality.\r\n\r\nIn your locate output I don't see the actual rethinkdb binary (it should be in /usr/bin/rethinkdb). Do you still have that installed?\r\n\r\n@acasanova can you try starting rethinkdb with the `--no-direct-io` flag and then test again if table creation works?"
