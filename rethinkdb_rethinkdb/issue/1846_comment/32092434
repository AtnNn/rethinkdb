      "@nviennot -- what style problems are most glaring?  The run-up to the LTS release has been starving the Ruby driver of attention recently, but long-term I'm hoping to bring it more in line with community standards.  (Some aspects of the driver are strange in order to make the Ruby/Python/JS APIs more similar, but probably most of the problems you see are things that we should just fix.)\r\n\r\n> Also, it might be worth using the @mutex for connect/close because this is not thread safe.\r\n\r\nCould you elaborate a bit?  Do you mean `r.connect` and `conn.close`?  Which parts of those (or other functions) aren't thread safe right now?"
