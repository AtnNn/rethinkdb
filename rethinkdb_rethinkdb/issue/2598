        "There do not seem to be any tests that cover the dump/backup/restore/import functions. This is obviously an important area for coverage, and so we need to write some tests in this area. The should cover things in the following ways:\n1. `./rethinkdb dump`\n2. `rethinkdb-dump`\n3. Explicitly importing `rethinkdb._import`, and using it directly from Python.\n\nThe way that both of the first two are implemented has them making external calls, and so they wind up using only the installed driver on the system. This will have to be worked around (e.g.: calls to specify the driver to use).\n"
