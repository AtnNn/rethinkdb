        "The `Connection` class in the Python driver currently supports the Python `with` structure, but our `Cursor` class does not. I just ran into a case where it would be nice to have this. An example for clarity:\n\n``` python\nwith r.db('foo').table('bar').run(conn) as full_table:\n     for row in full_table:\n          pass # do something in reality\n```\n\nWhile our `Cursor`s are not that expensive, it does make sure that things get cleaned up on-time.\n"
