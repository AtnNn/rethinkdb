        "I needed a better way to run tests and examine their results. The `run-tests.sh` script has a lot of unmaintainable code and other disadvantages. I ported it to python, improved the output of the script and added some flags that allow loading and examining previously run tests. It is in the `atnnn/490` branch in `test/run`.\n\nI still need to:\n- Clean up the code\n- Make it work on OS X (which I have not tested yet)\n- Have it generate HTML reports\n- Replace `run-tests.sh` for `make test`\n\nThe code for this script was also written with the polyglot tests in mind, so that fixing #1402 will be easier.\n"
