      "@coffeemug as far as writes are concerned I think you're going to find that next right now is faster than 1.4 was. This won't tell us much about secondary indexes though because one of those tests has write batching while the other doesn't. I think I told @Tryneus this was the case and I'm not sure if he already tested it so it would be good to get some corroboration on this. I don't think reads are affected at all but I suppose it can't hurt to check."
