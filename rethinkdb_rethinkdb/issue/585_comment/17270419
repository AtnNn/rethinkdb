Here's what I'd like to know:\r\n\r\n* For point writes (so batching doesn't pollute the numbers), what was the performance on 1.4?\r\n* What about point reads?\r\n* What's the performance for point reads and writes on next with no secondary indexes for an equivalent workload?\r\n* What's the performance for point reads and writes on next with one secondary index?\r\n\r\nReopening and moving back to 1.5 for now."
