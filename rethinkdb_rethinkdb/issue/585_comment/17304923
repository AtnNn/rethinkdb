      "That seems to make sense although since 1.6 is going to be all about looking at performance and stability I feel like this issue should be closed. It was about a few specific things that might be worth checking for 1.5 which @Tryneus  did check. I think if anything it's going to serve to prevent us from taking a holistic approach to bench marking and it's basically outlived its usefulness."
