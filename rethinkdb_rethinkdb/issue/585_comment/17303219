      "It doesn't make much sense to talk about point reads, as they don't touch the secondary index blocks at all.  If we actually want to compare performance changes due to secondary indexes, we should just look at writes.  I didn't compare the performance to 1.4 because that wasn't necessary for this issue, but I'll see what I kind of numbers I can get."
