        "I've been watching http://www.rethinkdb.com/videos/query-languages-and-dsls-in-ruby where @mlucy talks about reasons for implementing following comparisons:\r\n```ruby\r\nr.table('users').filter {|u|\r\n  r(5) < u[:infractions]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut there is a ruby feature, not very well known, called unsurprisingly coerce which allows you to implement comparisons and arithmetics with numbers without monkey-patching. \r\n\r\nYou can simply add something like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef coerce(other)\r\n  [r(other), self]\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nto appropriate class. After that the following expression ```5 < u[:infractions]``` will be automatically coerced to ```r(5) < u[:infractions]```"
