        "I've been watching http://www.rethinkdb.com/videos/query-languages-and-dsls-in-ruby where @mlucy talks about reasons for implementing following comparisons:\n\n``` ruby\nr.table('users').filter {|u|\n  r(5) < u[:infractions]\n}\n```\n\nBut there is a ruby feature, not very well known, called unsurprisingly coerce which allows you to implement comparisons and arithmetics with numbers without monkey-patching. \n\nYou can simply add something like:\n\n``` ruby\ndef coerce(other)\n  [r(other), self]\nend\n```\n\nto appropriate class. After that the following expression `5 < u[:infractions]` will be automatically coerced to `r(5) < u[:infractions]`\n"
