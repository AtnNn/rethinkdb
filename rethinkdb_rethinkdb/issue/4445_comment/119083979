      "We've covered some distance since we first designed this, and we have a little bit more perspective now and understanding of how people use the system. I think throwing on `undefined` when evaluating json document expressions is always too aggressive -- it's clearly not what people want the system to do. I think it would be dramatically better for user experience to just drop the undefined fields (though it's probably not too important to do fast because people don't run into it *that* frequently)."
