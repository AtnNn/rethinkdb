        "I'm using rethinkdbdash to run a query like so:\n\n``` javascript\nr.table(tables[index])\n    .between(r.minval, r.now().sub(oldestDocAge), { index: 'time' })\n    .orderBy({ index: r.asc('time') })\n    .limit(deleteCount)\n    .delete()\n    .run()\n    .then(doNext)\n```\n\nFull source: https://github.com/cyounkins/purge-db/blob/master/src/index.ts\n\nAs you can see, the limit() uses a constant. Why then does the result sometimes come back:\n\n```\n{ deleted: 96,\n  errors: 0,\n  inserted: 0,\n  replaced: 0,\n  skipped: 4,\n  unchanged: 0 }\n```\n\nThere are inserts going on (about 50 per second), but there are no other delete operations running.\n\nThe table in question has 2 shards, 2 replicas per shard, and two indices.\n"
