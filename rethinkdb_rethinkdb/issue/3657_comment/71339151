      "I find the \"live updates\" checkbox difficult to translate into the idea being proposed here. It sounds more like it would create a web page that will rerun the polling query when the results change. This would be something like a live view of the entire table.\r\n\r\nProviding a dynamically available run option sounds easier to understand.\r\n\r\nI have not had time to explore the new web interface, so I may be missing something with the checkbox interface."
