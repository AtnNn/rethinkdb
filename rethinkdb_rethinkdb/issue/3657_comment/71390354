      "Ignoring for the moment the problem of how to represent this in the UI (e.g. button, checkbox, etc.), I think it's a great idea that would give this (fairly critical) feature more prominence.\r\n\r\nI would hold off on this for a few more months, though, until we build up server support for more queries. I'm not entirely sure what ratio of commonly used queries are currently supported as feeds, but my guess is that it'll go up significantly after we introduce a few more features (specifically, gmr, but possibly some more). I think this would be an anti-feature if the button is grayed out most of the time, but would quickly convert into a killer feature if we can get to a point where ~75% of commonly typed queries in the data explorer can be supported.\r\n\r\nEDIT: note, I don't mean 75% of *all* queries one could possibly express; just 75% of the queries people commonly type in the data explorer."
