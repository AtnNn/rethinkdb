      "@grandquista: as I understand it, @mlucy is suggesting a button next to \"Run\" that says \"Changes\". I'm suggesting (not sure it's the best option yet) that a checkbox be placed near \"Run\" that says \"Run with live updates\", or \"Run with changefeeds\", for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- We already have several buttons (run, abort, all the buttons above the Data Explorer), and too many buttons can make an interface lose clarity.\r\n- Using a checkbox next to \"Run\" indicates to the user that changefeeds are an upgrade from simply running the query (streaming updates vs simply polling the database once).\r\n\r\nIf we decide to do this, I'll provide some mockups."
