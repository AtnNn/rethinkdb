      "TL;DR: we can close this issue once #1231 is merged.\r\n\r\n@atnnn updated the requirement for Browserify in #1231\r\n\r\nOnce it will be merged in next, we will require browserify >= 3 which uses native-buffer-browserify instead of buffer-browserify -- https://github.com/feross/native-buffer-browserify\r\n\r\nThe new buffer library sticks to the official node documentation and the depreciated `get`/`set` (not mentioned in the docs) has not been implemented so I pushed a fix on @atnnn's branch for that -- so it also removes the warning for the depreciation."
