      "Fixed in `michel_1803_buffer`\r\nReview 1117 assigned to @Tryneus \r\n\r\nI looked browerify's buffer implementation, and can't find why buffer.concat doesn't work (the truth is there is a test and it doesn't seem broken)\r\nI'll keep looking into it and hopefully we can fix that and completly remove `buffer.get` and `buffer.set`.\r\n\r\n@atnnn we should probably release the driver when this is merged (it's currently broken with node-protobuf)."
