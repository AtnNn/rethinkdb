      "Hum, I have a problem with the JavaScript driver since this morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n`buffer.get(i)` throws `Cannot read property 'NaN' of undefined`\r\nReplacing `buffer.get(i)` with `buffer[i]` seems to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nI think it's related to the new node-protobuf library that sometimes return a SlowBuffer instead of a Buffer.\r\n\r\nI'll keep looking into it.\r\nMoving in v1.11.x for now."
