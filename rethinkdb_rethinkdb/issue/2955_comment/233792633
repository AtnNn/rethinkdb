      "I can't reproduce this issue with the current `next`, and so am going to close it. I don't see an obvious place where it got fixed along the way, but checks with driver hacked to print the file locations it is using show everything where I put them with `TMPDIR`, both when using the driver directly and indirectly through the `rethinkdb` binary.\r\n\r\nJust to be pedantic: the version I tested (minus two `print` statements) will be out with the 2.4 version of RethinkDB, but is available in `next` at the moment."
