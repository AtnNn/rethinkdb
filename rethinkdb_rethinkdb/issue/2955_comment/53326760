      "@nickpoorman, the backup scripts are packaged as part of the python driver, have you tried updating that to the latest?\r\n\r\n@coffeemug, we actually use python's `tempfile.mkdtemp()`, which will already use environment variables if `--temp-dir` is not specified (even before v1.13.4), see [the article](https://docs.python.org/2/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.tempdir).  @nickpoorman, have you tried using that environment variable already?"
