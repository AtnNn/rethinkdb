      "I have two proposals. Adding a `DEL_ATTR` to simplify deleting an attribute and having the javascript driver recognize `undefined` as a shortcut for this.\r\n\r\nI'm imagining that much like `{'foo': r.row('foo') + 1}` is detected and changed into a `FUNC` term, `{'foo': undefined}` could be detected and changed into a `DEL_ATTR` term.\r\n\r\nYou might consider this too hacky if it has to be handled as a special value at the DatumTerm level, but it would fit with javascript conventions.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm just guessing that `DEL_ATTR` could be faster than `WITHOUT`, but I don't know enough about the implementation to know for sure."
