      "What might be better is to add `DEL_ATTR` to the protobuf, and allow the javascript driver to recognize setting `undefined` on an attribute as a call to `DEL_ATTR`. Then you'd be keeping with javascript conventions, *and* deleting an attribute might become faster/easier than `row.update( row.without(\"foo\") )`."
