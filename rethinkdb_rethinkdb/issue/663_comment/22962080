      "`undefined` isn't a value in JSON and it doesn't have a ready equivalent in languages besides Javascript. The way to do what you're looking for is using `literal`. For example to delete the field \"a\" from a value you can say:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable.update({a : r.literal()})\r\n```\r\n\r\n`literal` allows you to plop a value into an object exactly is it is. So `literal()` means put \"nothing\" in this value. This is the closest we could get to the use case you're describing and keep things cross platform."
