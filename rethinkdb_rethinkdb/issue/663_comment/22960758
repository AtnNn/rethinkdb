      "I am trying to remove a value from a document. I am really, really surprised I can't simply call `update` with an object literal and an attribute set to `undefined`. I know there are alternatives but because I'm building the update object dynamically just setting an attribute to `undefined` really would be the easiest way.\r\n\r\nThe error is: `Object field 'card' may not be undefined`"
