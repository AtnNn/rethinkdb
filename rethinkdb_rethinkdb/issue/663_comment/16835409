      "> I'm having trouble seeing how `DEL_ATTR` would different from `without` or how it could be made more efficient.\r\n\r\nIt might not necessarily be different, but it certainly would offer a degree of convenience that `without` doesn't.\r\n\r\nAnyway, let's go with a better error message for now. We'll open a separate issue for `DEL_ATTR` if/when this comes up again."
