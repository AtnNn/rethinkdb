      "So, we *could* make the JS driver treat `undefined` as `r.literal()` in case of update and it wouldn't impact other drivers. I think we chose not to do that because it would significantly complicate the driver (for example, how would we treat `undefined` in case of `insert`, or elsewhere?)\r\n\r\nThis might be worth revisiting though, if a lot of people report running into this problem."
