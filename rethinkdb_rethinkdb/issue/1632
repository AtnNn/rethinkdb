        "One of the goals of Rethink is to ensure that no single query (or small combination of queries) can take down the cluster or interfere with realtime operation. There are a few ways to do that:\r\n\r\n* Implement per-query memory limits (#1375)\r\n* Change the query language to enforce index use for expensive operations (#1566)\r\n* Automatically yield if a query takes too long (#1631)\r\n\r\nOne other change we can make is to automatically lower the coroutine priority for a query that takes over some number of evals (say 10000; we'll obviously have to pick a good constant). We can do this along with or after #1631. This will ensure that long analytics queries won't interfere with short realtime queries from the application.\r\n\r\nMoving to backlog."
