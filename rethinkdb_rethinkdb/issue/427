        "Hey all,  I'm evaluating rethinkdb for a project that has pretty large large data volume (I've mentioned to @jdoliner), and I just noticed that rethinkdb doesn't have a native time data type.    Now for my purposes doing unix epoch seconds would probably be ok, but doing time right is pretty handy for time series like data.  Are there any near term plans for a sane native time data story?\n"
