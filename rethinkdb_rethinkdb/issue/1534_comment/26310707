      "Alright, I can load the `rethinkdb_data` directory successfully with the binary @joshmarinacci provided.\r\n\r\n@atnnn -- do we have an easy way to do 32-bit builds from source right now?  That would let me start work on the original issue, and I'd like to narrow this down and make sure that it's actually a 32-bit/64-bit issue."
