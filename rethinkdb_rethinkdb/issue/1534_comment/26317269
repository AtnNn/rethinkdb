      "@joshmarinacci -- That line is unreachable because we only hit it if we fall through the switch statement, which should only happen if we're deserializing data that contains an invalid cJSON type.  I'm not 100% sure why that would be the case, but we've fixed some bugs in our cJSON implementation since 1.8, and we no longer use it to serialize things onto and off of disk, so I'm reasonably sure that you won't run into this again in the newest version.  If you do, though, please let us know!"
