      "Thanks!  Unfortunately I get the same error, so this is probably an actual bug of some sort.\r\n\r\nThis is sort of outside the part of the code I understand.  @srh probably understands it a lot better, but he's gone until Tuesday.\r\n\r\nI have a few hypotheses I'd like to check, though.  You're running 32-bit RethinkDB, right?  This might be caused by trying to read those data files with 64-bit RethinkDB.  Would you be willing to upload the binary you're using somewhere so that I can narrow this down a little more?\r\n\r\n@atnnn, do we have an easy way to build 32-bit versions of RethinkDB from source right now?"
