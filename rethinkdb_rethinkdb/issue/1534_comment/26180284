      "Looking at where @joshmarinacci saw the original crash, we shouldn't get there unless we're deserializing corrupted JSON data.  If the database files were corrupted somehow, that might also explain why `n_files` is `4`.  It seems odd that we would be getting this error while @joshmarinacci isn't, however."
