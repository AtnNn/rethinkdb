      "I looked into this a little more, and I don't think I understand how this code works.\r\n\r\nThe call to `create_proxies` is from the `serializer_multiplexer_t` constructor in the `res == 0` branch of `file_based_svs_by_namespace_t<protocol_t>::get_svs`.  This branch constructs an empty vector, then pushes a single serializer onto it and calls the constructor with that vector of one serializer.\r\n\r\n`serializer_multiplexer_t` passes that vector down unmolested to `create_proxies`, which correctly sees that the size of the vector is one.  What I don't see is how it could ever *not* be one.  So I don't get what `n_files` is supposed to be, or why it would ever be `4`.\r\n\r\n@srh, can you shed any light on this?"
