      "While we're at it can it be \"Show multi datacenter options?\" According to Chicago Manual of Style you're only supposed to hyphenate \"if doing so will significantly aid the reader in recognizing the compound adjective.\" For example \"large print paper\" might be confusing because it's unclear if it's paper with large print on it or larger paper intended for print. Our case doesn't have that ambiguity."
