        "So, recently printing most values in gdb stopped working for me.  It looks like the cause is Graham's change to `rethinkdb-gdb.py`:\n\n```\ncommit ce4bbb8a9244c2fd294c0c2e75158f2893688611\nAuthor: Graham Hughes <graham@rethinkdb.com>\nDate:   Mon Aug 11 15:48:31 2014 -0700\n\n    Make this actually load in gdb without error\n```\n\nMy guess is that this made the script work well enough for gdb to load and try to use it, but not well enough for gdb to actually print values:\n\n```\n(gdb) p __y\n$3 = Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/ssd2/mlucy/rethinkdb/build/debug_clang/rethinkdb-gdb.py\", line 526, in to_string\n    reptype = gdb.lookup_type(str(realtype) + '::_Rep').pointer()\nRuntimeError: No type named std::basic_string<char>::_Rep.\n```\n\nI'm compiling on the build farm with all the default settings (except DEBUG=1), which I think uses clang.\n\n@gchpaco -- any insight into this?\n"
