      "Ah, for-each loops require it, right, I missed that. \r\n\r\nI think the benefits of allowing `for (x : cursor)` are worth slightly violating the interface in this respect.\r\n\r\nA second function `runIterable` would just be less intuitive. It would also still not be a real `Iterable`, since we have no way to have cursors that you can iterate multiple times (unless we store all results in memory, which defeats the purpose of a cursor)."
