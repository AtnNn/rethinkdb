      "It was for the exact reason stated, you can otherwise not use it in a for-each loop. We could add a method `runIterable` which would return an Iterable for a forEach loop, and have `run` just return the iterator directly.\r\n\r\nThis would be a little annoying, but if it really goes against the grain of Java developers' expectations, it might be worth it."
