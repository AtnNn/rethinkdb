        "Someone reported that after running ./configure on RedHat 6, make fails with the following output:\n\n```\n./scripts/gen-version.sh: Warning: could not determine the version, using the default version '1.11.2-fallback'\n    [1/44] DOWNLOAD libunwind\n\ngzip: stdin: not in gzip format\ntar: Child died with signal 13\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\nmake[1]: *** [support/src/libunwind] Error 2\nmake: *** [make] Error 2\n```\n\nThe user reports that libunwind is installed. There are a couple of questions here:\n- Why do we automagically fetch dependencies even when the user doesn't pass `--allow-fetch` to the config script? Is it a bug? If not, what's the point of `--allow-fetch`?\n- Why does the fetching process fail?\n- Can the user manually provide the path via `unwind=PATH`? I saw a reference in #641 that it doesn't work.\n"
