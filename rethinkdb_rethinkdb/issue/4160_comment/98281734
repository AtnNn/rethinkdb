      "Hi @tcoats, I'm not aware of anything better than `conn._sendQuery` at the moment (which is of course also not part of the official API, and could change at any time).\r\n\r\nMaking ReQL queries serializable sounds useful. We should probably support it across all drivers then.\r\n\r\nI cannot say yet when we'll get to this, but we'll keep it on our list of things to discuss."
