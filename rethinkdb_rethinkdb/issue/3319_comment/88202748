      "Another option would be to fall back to string matching transparently if the match regex is a plain string (this was suggested in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2196#issuecomment-39141983).\r\n\r\nHowever `contains()` still has the advantage that it avoids generating the relatively complex result object that `match` generates. Instead `contains` could just return `true` or `false`."
