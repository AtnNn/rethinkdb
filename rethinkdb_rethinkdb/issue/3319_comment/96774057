      "Urgh, good point. Though `r.substr` reminds me of `std::string::substr` which would give you a slice. If it'll also work on arrays in the future we should come up with a name that doesn't have `str` as part of it.\r\n\r\nThe C way is using `strstr` which essentially gives an offset. Could we extend `offsets_of` to give you the offsets of the substring or `null` if it isn't found?"
