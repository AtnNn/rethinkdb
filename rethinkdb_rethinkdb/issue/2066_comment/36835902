      "What would you expect `r.db(\"test\").table(\"test\").group(\"city\").group(\"owner\")` to do? Currently we can't have groups of groups, though this would be pretty cool, particularly since `ungroup` is a command to pop the stack. It would get rather confusing, though.\r\n\r\nI do think we should improve the error message."
