      "I was expecting `group(\"owner\")` to create groups on each previously computed groups.\r\n\r\nBasically it's something similar to `.group(\"city\", \"owner\")`, but with a result with more hierarchy. So I was expecting a result like\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        group: \"NY\",\r\n        reduction: [\r\n            {\r\n                group: \"Owner1\",\r\n                reduction: ...\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                group: \"Owner2\",\r\n                reduction: ...\r\n            },\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        group: \"SF\",\r\n        reduction: [\r\n            {\r\n                group: \"Owner3\",\r\n                reduction: ...\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                group: \"Owner4\",\r\n                reduction: ...\r\n            },\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n]\r\n```"
