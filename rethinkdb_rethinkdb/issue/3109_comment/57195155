      "I looks like the problem is the version of Boost that is installed on your system is not compatible. We do have a check in `errors.hpp` with a range of Boost versions to try and prevent this class of problems, but it looks like that compiled fine, so there is probably a specific version in that range that we don't work well with.\r\n\r\nThis is easy to work around though, just add `--fetch boost` to your `./configure` line and that should bypass this problem by downloading the version that we get with internally.\r\n\r\nAnd so I can verify this, and possibly work around it, could you post the version of Boost that you have? The methods can be found in this post:\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3708706/how-to-determine-the-boost-version-on-a-system"
