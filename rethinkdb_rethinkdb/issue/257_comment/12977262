      "Sorry, but that still seems bad. Suppose I clone the repo, run make, and then run rethinkdb. I won't get the UI unless I pass --web-assets because there are no shared assets installed. That's a pretty bad experience. I'd much rather call the dir `rethinkdb_web_assets`, which would solve our problems and we'd never have to think about it again."
