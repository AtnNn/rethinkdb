      "You actually explicitly said to me: \"JD don't worry about distinguishing between masters and replicas, it's too complicated and doesn't actually make a difference.\" This behavior was fine for 1.2 because it made things simpler and clumped up masters was very far from being a bottle neck at that point. These are both still true so I'm not sure if it's really worth reconsidering.\r\n\r\n"
