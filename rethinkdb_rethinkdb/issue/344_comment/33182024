      "This appears to work fine. Basically it still tries primarily to balance the number of replica roles over machines. However it assigns slightly higher costs to primaries. So if the number of replicas (secondaries+primaries) on two machines is the same and it can assign primaries/secondaries to either of those, it assign the primary to the one that currently has fewer primary roles."
