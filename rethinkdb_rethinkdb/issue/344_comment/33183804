      "Also, what I meant by \"it will not guarantee that primaries for a given table are distributed across machines\" is the following:\r\nSay we have two nodes A and B. Node A currently has 3 primaries for table 1 (e.g. because they were manually pinned to node A). Node B has no roles.\r\nNow if we create a second table and shard it into 2, both primaries can end up on node B. I think this is a desired property though. We primarily want the suggester to distribute load. Distributing primaries for a single table across different nodes is just an aspect of that goal which makes sense in some scenarios but not in others."
