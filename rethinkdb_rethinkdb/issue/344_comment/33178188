      "I wonder if it would be enough to assign primaries a higher \"usage\" value than secondaries.\r\n\r\nThis could be changed in `suggest_blueprint_for_shard()` in the file src/clustering/suggester/suggester.cc (*not* src/clustering/*administration*/suggester.cc).\r\nCurrently, we have lines like this:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n//Update primary_usage\r\n++(*usage)[primary];\r\n...\r\n//Update secondary usage\r\n++(*usage)[*jt];\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat if we just made the first one something like `(*usage)[primary] += 10` and the second one for example `(*usage)[*jt] += 7` or something like that?\r\n\r\nEverything else being equal between nodes, I think this might be enough to have primaries distributed between machines.\r\n"
