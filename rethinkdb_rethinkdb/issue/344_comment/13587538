      "I would never say that. The whole purpose of sharding is to split the table's shards across multiple machines, otherwise the feature has no point. I ran into this bug while doing a demo, and it immediately confused both me, and the people I was demoing the product to. This is also why we added the `prefer_distribution` flag, to tell the server we value spreading out the shards over availability.\r\n\r\nThere are at least three separate issues in the deprecated branch where the observed behavior is that the shard primaries are placed on the same machine and the expected behavior is stated to be that the primaries should be on different machines (all three submitted by me):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb-deprecated/issues/1232\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb-deprecated/issues/617\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb-deprecated/issues/1378\r\n\r\nThis definitely needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nEDIT: found another issue to the same affect -- https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb-deprecated/issues/1383"
