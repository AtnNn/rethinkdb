      "@Tryneus: What it does not do - in case that's what you mean - is to weight those two criteria against each other.\r\nThe one always has a \"hard\" priority over the other. Weighting them against each other would make it much more complicated though. It is also difficult to do if we don't know how much a backfilling or an assignment actually costs. To do that properly, we would have to take things like available disk space on a node, speed of backfilling (which varies heavily based on the storage system used, network bandwidth, cache size etc.) etc. into account.\r\nAnother limitation of our current solution is that it is greedy. So it does not necessarily find the global optimum. In general this is a combinatorial problem with exponential complexity. We might implement a better approximation some time than we get from the greedy approach, but that's definitely outside of the scope of this issue."
