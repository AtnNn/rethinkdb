        "I heard of RethinkDB. So started to explore it. I am looking for a particuler solution :\n\nWhenever a new comment is posted, a notification should be sent to all other user who had commented on that post. A tradition solution is everytime a comment is posted, iterate through all user who commented and send them notification. But its a bit time consuming solution, cos evertime a new comment comes you have to iterate through all user.\n\nThe kind of solution I am finding (if possible through RethinkDB). I will maintain a record per post:\n\n```\nTable: PostComments\n----------------------------\nPostId=> user1, user2, user3.............userN\n```\n\nSo if a new comment comes, i will just notify to \"PostId\" and as all \"user\" are there subscribed alreday, it should be notified automatically\n"
