      "I appreciate that my scenario is unusual - I just reported it as an issue in case you guys thought this behaviour was undesirable (and nobody had noticed because it's unusual!)\r\n\r\n@Tryneus I'm not sure about how you want to handle nodes changing IP/port, but in most cases a warning on startup that a node in the cluster was unreachable would be preferable to blocking entirely (in my opinion).\r\n\r\nJust a couple of cents though, I have a perfectly usable workaround so please close this if you think it's not an issue :)"
