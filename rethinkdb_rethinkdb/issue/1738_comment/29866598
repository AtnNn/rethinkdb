      "Ah, sorry, I misread the original issue.  But still, I'm not sure if we should change that behavior.  It could be a little tricky to add timeouts to the initial join at startup, but certainly doable.  Perhaps @coffeemug could comment on what the behavior should be.\r\n\r\nThere is a trick you can do to connect two instances of rethinkdb to each other after startup - by starting another instance that connects to each of the others.  The simplest way is to use the `rethinkdb proxy` with `--join <node A> --join <node B>`, and they will all be pulled into the same cluster.  The reason to use proxy is that it doesn't represent a permanent member of the cluster and there's no cleanup necessary once you kill it (you could also use `rethinkdb admin` for the same effect).  Keep in mind that this is a workaround, I don't recommend this for serious operations, as it's a little hacky."
