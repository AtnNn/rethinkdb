      "> It therefore seemed wrong to me that I couldn't restart one half of my cluster whilst the other is unavailable.\r\n\r\nI agree with this assertion, but I think a cluster of two nodes is a special case. You wouldn't run into this problem if you had three or more nodes, for instance.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is worth changing for the two node scenario. @mafrosis & others -- what do  you think?"
