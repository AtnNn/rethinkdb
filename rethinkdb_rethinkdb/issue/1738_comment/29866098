      "This is actually a result of the startup parameters you pass to `rethinkdb`.  If there are any `--join` or `-j` command-line (or config file) options passed to `rethinkdb`, it will wait until it has connected to at least one peer before completing startup.\r\n\r\nI assume that your node A does not have any `--join` options defined, while your node B is told to `--join` node A on startup."
