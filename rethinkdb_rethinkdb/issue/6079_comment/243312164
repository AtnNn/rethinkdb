      "@nodesocket Probably not a ton of code, but it will require work for all drivers and I'm a bit concerned that this will lead us to feature-creep, which will add additional maintenance work down the road.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should add functions to ReQL just because they require additional libraries in some of our supported client languages, unless running them on the database adds some additional benefits.\r\n\r\nEncryption is somewhat on the edge, since doing encryption and decryption on the database can sometimes allow you to do things that aren't otherwise possible, such as indexing encrypted data (though the index would need access to the encryption key). I don't think this applies to bcrypt though.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this for now. If you feel strongly that this should become a part of ReQL, I'm happy to give it more consideration."
