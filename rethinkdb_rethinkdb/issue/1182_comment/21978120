      "Whoops, sorry it took so long to get to this, been working on a bunch of different things the past couple weeks.  As for finding the symbols from the backtrace, it would be nice to know which version of rethinkdb you were running.  I just brute-forced it with some symbol files, until I got a stack trace that made sense, and it looks like the exception was occuring in `protob_server_t` when trying to write the description of an authentication failure.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed a place in `protob_server_t::handle_conn` where it writes to the connection without a try...catch block, so that's probably what happened here.  For that situation to arise, you would a client to connect, have a problem with authorization, and then the client immediately closes the connection before we can respond, as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have a fix for the uncaught exception up in review 780."
