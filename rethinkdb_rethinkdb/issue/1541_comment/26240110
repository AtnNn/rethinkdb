      "@presidentbeef -- just to be sure, by client, you mean the application that uses a RethinkDB client driver, not the RethinkDB server itself, correct?\r\n\r\nIf so, which driver are you using (i.e. which language)? Can you give us the idea of what the application is doing? Would it be possible to narrow it down to a query that worked well before, but then started using more RAM?\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting this issue, we appreciate your help immensely. (Also, if you fill out this form -- http://www.rethinkdb.com/community/shirts-for-stories/ -- we'd love to send you a t-shirt for your troubles)."
