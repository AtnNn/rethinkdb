      "Haha, oops. I was going to confirm something and then I submitted without updating the issue with info like which driver I was using... I see this increase with the Ruby driver (1.10.0.1). I tried to confirm that it doesn't happen in the web interface, but actually it takes too long in either version.\r\n\r\nThe query is pretty simple, just grabbing a bunch of records:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nr.table(\"reports\").get_all(\r\n  \"6778223c963cef556581a322e2b90d51de58b76c\",\r\n  {:index => \"brakeman_sha\"}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe query takes 24 seconds and 142 MB on 1.9. On 1.10 it takes 114 seconds and 812 MB :crying_cat_face: This is just on the client/driver side.\r\n\r\nEdit: server side, with 1.9: 162 MB, with 1.10: 588 MB."
