      "We don't enforce any order on the tree view, but I think it would be a good idea to do it.\r\n\r\nWe do order fields in the table view depending on\r\n- first how often the field is defined in the documents retrieved\r\n- if two fields have the same occurrence, I alphabetically order them.\r\n\r\nOrdering keys on the tree view should be a 3 lines fix.\r\n\r\nTagging as 1.6. Thank you @Linicks for reporting this : )"
