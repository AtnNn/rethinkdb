      "It's now half fixed in branch `michel_536_large_file`, code review 310.\r\n\r\nThe improvements are the following ones:\r\n- We do not make suggestions if the query is too long (current limit set to 1000 char - at this point, codemirror doesn't highlight things too)\r\n- We do not make suggestions if the query contains too many functions/object (current limit set to 100)\r\n- Fix a regex (that was the main culprit)\r\n\r\nNow pasting one line of 150k char require about 2-3 seconds to be printed. Updating the line takes about the same time. The reason why it's slow is because codemirror will repaint the line (the line is currently the smallest unit that get re-painted). See https://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror/issues/1022\r\nUsers can still paste a lot of data as long as there are some new lines in.\r\n\r\nI'll write a little doc about this limitation on the website. Meanwhile, I'll take a look tonight or tomorrow at codemirror to see how much work it would be to fix codemirror myself but after a first glance, it looks like a lot of work."
