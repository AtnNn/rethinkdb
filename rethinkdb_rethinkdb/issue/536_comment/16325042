      "FYI @neumino , this is also an issue in 1.4.3. Here's how to reproduce it:\r\n\r\nType `r.table('foo').insert([{}, {}, ...])` in data explorer where you have a few hundred empty documents. Observe that copy pasting, typing, and moving arrow keys gets really slow, but only at the end of the query (right before the last `]` character and `)`. Everywhere else things seem fast enough. This is probably a different issue, so feel free to close this one and open a new one if you'd like.\r\n\r\n"
