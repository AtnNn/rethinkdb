      "A first version of this is up for review with CR 3729 from branch `larkost/2598-test-dump-restore`. It handles:\r\n- round-tripping all of our data types through dump/restore and export/import (the latter both single file and a whole folder)\r\n- round-tripping for strings and uuid using `cvs` (the only types that survive the trip)\r\n- includes indexes and a trivial check of `_index_rebuild`"
