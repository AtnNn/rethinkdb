      "Should `reconfigure()` wait for the tables to be ready before returning? If not, it would presumably return a status that showed the tables as unavailable. Is that OK?\r\n\r\nI'd prefer to omit the `status` field completely.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug: If the user reconfigures multiple tables, how would that be shown in the result?"
