      "I would be fine with having `reconfigure` (and `rebalance`) always return an array with one entry per table, similar to `table_wait()`.\r\n\r\nAt the same time one can make an argument that `reconfigure` really behaves quite differently from `table_wait()`, in that you cannot just give it an arbitrary set of tables. As far as I understand, you will be able to either run it on a whole db (#3225), or on a single table.\r\nSo maybe having it return just a single object when it's applied to a single table, and having it return an array only when applied to a db would be a more reasonable choice here.\r\n\r\nI really don't know which option I would prefer. I think I have a slight preference for the second one, i.e. only returning an array if you run it on a db. @coffeemug @mlucy opinions on this?"
