      "@danielmewes, I think the second option makes the most sense.  This isn't the same as `table_status`, `table_config`, and `table_wait`, where it is always run at the `db` level and where you can provide an arbitrary set of tables to work on.  If we changed it to always be `db.table_reconfigure([tables...,] shards=x, replicas=y)`, things would be different.\r\n\r\nAs is stands, if we have `db.reconfigure(shards=x, replicas=y)` and `table.reconfigure(shards=x, replicas=y`), I think it makes the most sense for the db-level to return an array and table-level to return a single object."
