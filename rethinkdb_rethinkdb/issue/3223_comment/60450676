      "The impetus for this was me calling `reconfigure` when I played with the API, getting back a new config, and then wondering \"so what happened?\" It's not at all clear from the return value whether the server is done reconfiguring, or started reconfiguring, or did nothing, or something else. It also wasn't clear how the new config differed from the old, or what happened, really.\r\n\r\nSo I thought that returning old config, new config, and status would solve these problems. It would tell me exactly how the config changed, and what's going on inside the server. I think that gives the user much clearer visibility into what's happening, and makes them feel like they really grok what's going on."
