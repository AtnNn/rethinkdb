      "> I am in 2 minds about using ReQL virtual tables for this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to solve this dilemma is to use ReQL virtual tables, and add a simple HTTP API that allows reading all ReQL tables. This way would get us the best of both worlds for monitoring, but also for simple access to data in general.\r\n\r\n"
