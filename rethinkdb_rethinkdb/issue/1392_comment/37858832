      "I am in 2 minds about using ReQL virtual tables for this sort of thing. In some ways it's a fair bit better as it's a more native experience but at the same time that vast majority of the people monitoring these stats are not going to be the developers writing the applications.\r\n\r\nSo I think it's better to be mindful or the sort of things people will be wanting to hook up to this interface. Namely old and busted software like Nagios, Ganglia, Sensu etc. HTTP GET is also lighter weight than ReQL if your client is going to be spun up each time it's executed.\r\nThere is also the case for monitoring daemons written in languages other than the fully supported client languages, these are no doubt in the minority but it does happen. (Perl/C namely)\r\n\r\nAgreed on the fact that `/ajax/stat` is too heavy.\r\n\r\nWhist not strictly stats related it would also be nice if there was another endpoint `/ajax/machines` maybe? that aggregated all of the interesting things about a machine other than it's performance data. For instance wether or not our node thinks said machine is reachable, what it's name, UUID and IP addresses are. Atm you need to piece together information from across the `/ajax/directory` and `/ajax/semilattice` to get a decent idea about the cluster state. This makes writing availability monitoring etc plugins daunting for people that don't understand RethinkDB very well.\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that other than cluster issues there is very little that indicates if a machine is dead/zombie etc. Machine state should be more of a first class citizen IMO."
