      "@ajose01 Note that the particular change described here wouldn't change the complexity of `distinct`. It would just make it faster by a constant factor.\r\nIt would still iterate over each document in the index. However it could iterate more quickly since checking whether a key has been seen before would not require loading the whole document."
