        "When a server is added to a cluster it does not automatically get assigned any shards. This is probably a good thing, since it allows advanced admins to finely tune their apps (and lots of other complicated situation). However, it is going to result in a lot of admins naively adding more machines to their cluster, then being confused when it does not make anything any faster and does not protect their data when the one machine with data falls over.\n\nA possible solution to this would be to make unused servers painfully obvious in the WebUI. Maybe with a warning notice saying something like \"There are 3 unused machines, would you like to assign them to tables?\".\n"
