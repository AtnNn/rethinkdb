      "I'm in favour of requiring the member `\"error\"` in failure cases, it simplifies the protocol marginally and an error message makes it easier to debug what's failing.\r\n\r\nInstead of the version I'd like to propose an optional member `\"capabilities\"` in the first message from the client to the server containing an array of strings with capabilities that the client supports. We may need to do this server to client as well.\r\n"
