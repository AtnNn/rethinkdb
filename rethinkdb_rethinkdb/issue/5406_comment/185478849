      "Oh right. We were talking about the client version the other day and didn't know what it should be, but indeed it should send something akin to the different magic numbers that we currently have I think.\r\nMaybe just \"{protocol_version: <integer>}\", where the integer would be 1 for now, and could be incremented in the future if we ever change the handshake again?\r\n\r\nOne more remark: \"and MAY contain a member \"error\" containing a description of the error. \" / \"If not successful it MAY contain a member \"error\"\"\r\nI think both of these should be \"MUST contain\". The error being optional just adds an additional case that all clients will need to handle."
