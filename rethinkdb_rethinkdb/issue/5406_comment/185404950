      "This looks good to me.  The only thing that comes to mind is that maybe the client should also send a version in the second step so that we don't have to bump the magic number every time we want to make a backwards-incompatible change.  (I think the magic number should only change if the wire format changes, not if e.g. the fields in the JSON objects change.)"
