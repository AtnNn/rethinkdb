      "Why can't the client send this stuff together?\r\n```\r\n0xd27951cc\r\n{\r\n  protocol_version: 4,\r\n  authentication: \"SCRAM-SHA-256\",\r\n  \"user\": \"mlucy\",\r\n  \"nonce\": XXX,\r\n  # Maybe a capabilities array in a future protocol version.\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt seems like an unnecessary round trip. If the server doesn't support the protocol version or authentication method it can just error as its first response."
