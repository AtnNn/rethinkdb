      "@mlucy I think allowing for the extra roundtrip in case the protocol isn't supported by the server might be better. It makes the protocol slightly more complex, but removes a round trip. I've seen lots of benchmarks and simple applications where a new connection is opened for each request, so I think connection setup latency does matter.\r\n\r\nIn practice, most users are going to run servers that match the client version and hence the fallback case where the authentication protocol isn't supported by the server is going to be very rare."
