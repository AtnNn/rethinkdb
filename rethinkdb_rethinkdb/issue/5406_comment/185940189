      "Merging the messages seems bad.  You want the server to say what protocols it speaks *before* the client starts talking to it, I think.\r\n\r\nOne way we could change the protocol to allow lower latency is we could say that if the client asks for a protocol the server doesn't support, the server responds with an error but keeps listening for another protocol request.  (So instead of erring out it goes back to waiting for step 3.)  Then the client could send the magic number and optimistically send the protocol request, and if the server doesn't support that protocol then the client can send the \"correct\" protocol request after receiving the server version and swallow the first error."
