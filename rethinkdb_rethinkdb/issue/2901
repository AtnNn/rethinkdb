        "We should have an undocumented table or other such interface that contains information we don't want the user to touch. This has two purposes: testing, and debugging users' problems.\n- @larkost needs this table to contain the split points for tables for testing purposses. Now that we're not exposing split points through the public API, the tests need a way to access them, and this seems better than having the tests guess wildly.\n- We should expose the directory in all its gory detail. `rethinkdb.table_status` glosses over many details, so it's not very useful for debugging mysterious hangs.\n- We could expose UUIDs here.\n\nI'm not sure what else belongs in this table. We can add more things as we think of them.\n"
