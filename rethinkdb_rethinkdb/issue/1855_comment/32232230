      "@coffeemug -- I think alphabetical is what we want for `collapse` with no arguments, but when people specify fields I think that we should proceed from left to right through the fields.  This gives people a really easy way to get the merge behavior they want (`stream.collapse('b', 'a')` if they want a b-preferential merge).  I also don't think we should support nested object syntax; it seems too complicated to me, and you can get most of what you want from it by chaining collapse commands."
