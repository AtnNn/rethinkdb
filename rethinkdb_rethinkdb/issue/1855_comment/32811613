      "I'm happy with this proposal.\r\n\r\nOne problem with defaulting `clobber` to `false` is that the command isn't very useful on streams. As @atnnn pointed out, this option will result in different document structures depending on the content of each document, which in turn makes processing the resulting stream very difficult. So in practice, people will either set `clobber` to `true`, or use `map`, or set `clobber` to `false` but *only* if they know what they're doing.\r\n\r\nI think \"useful and compatible with the old `zip`\" is better than \"impractical but safe\" in this context."
