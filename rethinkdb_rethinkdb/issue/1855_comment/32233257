      "@neumino -- for nested arguments, `collapse` would rip out the specified nested field and leave the rest as is (assuming we want to support that). So:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.expr({left: {a: 1, b: 2}, right: {b: {e:5}, c: 4}}).collapse('left', { 'right': 'b' })\r\n{a:1, b:2, right: {c: 4}, e: 5}\r\n```\r\n\r\n@atnnn -- one other option is to have an optional `conflict` that can take on a couple of meanings (e.g. `prefix`, and `merge`). That would be really cool (though a bit complicated).\r\n"
