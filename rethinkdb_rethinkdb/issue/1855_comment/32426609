      "Yes! I just thought of something slightly different -- I was still unhappy with the command because when `delimiter` is specified, sometimes I want to delimit *everything*, and sometimes only ambiguous fields. I think `clobber` would be awesome -- when the user doesn't specify the delimiter it would have the behavior above. When the delimiter is specified, it would be used for everything or only ambiguous cases depending on `clobber`.\r\n\r\nThe only problem here is that `clobber` isn't the best name in the context of a delimiter. Other than that, this would make this command awesome!!"
