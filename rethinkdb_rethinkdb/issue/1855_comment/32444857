      "@atnnn -- ok. If `clobber` is `true`, it clobbers them, if it's `false` it leaves them as is.\r\n\r\nAlso, I propose an optarg `prefix` (only used if `delimiter` is set) with possible values `all` and `conflict`. If set to `all` it uses the delimiter to prefix everything, otherwise only fields that are in conflict.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking about this for a bit, I like names `clobber` and `collapse`, I think using these is cool, and the command would be absolutely awesome!"
