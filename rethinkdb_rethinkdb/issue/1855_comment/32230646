      "I think that he default should not be to traverse the fields in alphabetical order because naming should not affect the order of operations. It would cause programs to behave differently if the names of the fields change and we would be encouraging programmers to prefix their fields so that they sort correctly (such as `01_foo`, `02_bar` and `03_quux`).\r\n\r\nI suggest that `.collapse()` should just merge the `left` and `right` fields."
