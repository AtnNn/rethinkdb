      "I strongly disagree, particularly because hardcoding `left` and `right` has terrible taste to me, and any arbitrarily selected order (other than perhaps random) is better than hardcoding two field names. If we want `collapse()` to work by default, we'd have to pick *some* order, and alphabetical order is probably the best we can hope for. Alternatively we can drop support for `collapse` with no arguments, but I think the pros of supporting that with alphabetical ordering outweigh the cons of not supporting it at all."
