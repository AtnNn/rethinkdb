      "@mlucy -- I think it's a matter of taste. The zen of python says \"flat is better than nested\" and I often try to flatten my documents whenever I can. I know a lot of others do too -- that's why we added `zip`, because many people don't want to deal with the nestedness.\r\n\r\nI think occasional string-munging edge cases might not be sufficient justification not to do this -- we just have to define what happens in that case. If this function could do an alphanumeric collapse or a delimiter collapse, I personally would find it *really* handy in my travels with RethinkDB. I don't want to project on other people too much though, let's ask @mglukhovsky when he gets back if he likes it. I think he is from the \"flatten whenever you can\" camp too."
