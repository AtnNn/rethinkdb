      "@coffeemug -- `zip` is useful because instead of writing `obj['left']['field']`, you just write `obj['field']` in the common case where there are no conflicts.  If we make collapse just use string munging combinations, everything is still ugly.  For example, `tbl.eq_join(tbl2).eq_join(tbl3)` would yield things like:\r\n```\r\n{left_field1: ...\r\n left_field2: ...\r\n right_left_field3: ...\r\n right_left_field4: ...\r\n right_right_field5: ...\r\n right_right_field6: ...}\r\n```"
