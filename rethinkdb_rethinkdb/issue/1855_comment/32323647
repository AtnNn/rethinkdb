      "I would argue that concatenating field names isn't an instance of \"flat is better than nested\" -- you still have nested structure, you're just using string delimiters to express it rather than having it be explicit in the object structure (which is why you'd end up with names like \"right_left_field3\" -- you're using the name to express where the field is in the nested structure).  From that perspective, I think string delimiters are a much worse way of expressing nested structure than explicit object structure."
