        "Talked about this with @mglukhovsky yesterday. It'd be a good idea to be able to identify which language/driver people are using to connect with so we know how to prioritize driver development. Ideally, the server could keep track of what kinds of drivers connect and report it in the daily report. Since we're contemplating a protocol modification in #3934 , this might be a good thing to do at the same time.\r\n\r\nping @mlucy @danielmewes "
