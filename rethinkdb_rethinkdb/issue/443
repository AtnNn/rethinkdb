        "As suggested by @Raynos.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion is the `cur.each` API having a seperate callback for the cursor being finished / empty. That way you don't need an `if (cur.hasNext())`. The second callback is optional.\r\n\r\nIf people prefer they can still use the `if (cur.hasNext())` pattern in the `onrow` callback.\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncur.each(function onrow(err, row) {\r\n    if (err) throw err;\r\n    processRow(row);\r\n}, function onfinished(err) {\r\n    finishedRowProcessing();\r\n});\r\n```"
