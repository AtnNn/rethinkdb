      "@cggaurav \r\n> Is restore backward compatible?\r\n\r\nIt looks like that is the problem. Secondary index definitions from future versions of RethinkDB are generally not backwards compatible.\r\n\r\nI think we fixed the issue that the server crashes when getting such an index, but that fix isn't in the older 2.1.x releases yet (or I'm misremembering and we never actually fixed is. @Tryneus do you remember?).\r\n\r\nIn any case, if you need to import the 2.2.x data into a 2.1.x server, you can import the data only without the secondary indexes by passing the `--no-secondary-indexes` flag to `rethinkdb restore`. You'd then need to recreate the secondary indexes manually."
