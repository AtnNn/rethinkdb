      "A fix for https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5428 is now in code review which adds proxy listings to the `jobs` table. I think they will also appear in `current_issues`, though only memory issues will currently work for proxies.\r\n\r\nThe other tables still don't include proxies, so this issue is still relevant."
