      "Currently we generate a connection ID when setting up an HTTP-backed ReQL connection. These IDs are very predictable and so an attacker doesn't need to get the reply of the connection setup POST request before they can send a query (the web browser would reject the reply because of the same origin policy).\r\nA decent way of fixing this issue would be to generate a cryptographic random hash instead and use that as the the connection ID, so the attacker couldn't guess it."
