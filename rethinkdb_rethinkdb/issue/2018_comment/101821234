      "Turns out we are still vulnerable. At least as of v2.0.x our HTTP server does not appear to check any headers to verify the origin of a request, and I was able to make cross-domain requests successfully. The browser throws an error because of the cross origin request, but that only happens *after* it has sent the request to rethinkdb and has received the response."
