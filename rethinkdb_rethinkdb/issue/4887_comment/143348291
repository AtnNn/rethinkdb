      "@chris9753's theory makes sense to me. Resumable changefeeds ( #3471) might make sense for this use case, where the frontend connection can be dropped and you want to pick up changes where they left off. The current strategy for this is to do as @marshall007 says and close the cursor when you get the disconnect message, then start a new changefeed when the client reconnects."
