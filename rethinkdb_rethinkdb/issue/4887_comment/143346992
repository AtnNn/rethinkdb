      "@danielmewes socket.io connections disconnect and reconnect somtimes  and each time they have a different id. Typically, this behaviour shouldn't affect anything unless the reference to the socket is cached or a completely different reference entirely..... The rethinkdb connection is never reset and I received no errors. Thus, my theory is that because it stops working when i refresh the page(start a new socket.io connection) the  socket.emit in cursor.each sends it to clients that do not exist.. anymore.."
