      "Alternatively, you can open up a changefeed on the entire table and just emit events to the relevant connected client when you receive a change. This is a more stateless approach that I've found easier to maintain, but obviously it can come at some performance cost.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table('foos').changes().then(function (cursor) {\r\n  cursor.each(function (row) {\r\n    var socketId = socketIdForRow(row);\r\n    // io.connected contains all connected clients\r\n    var socket = io.connected[socketId];\r\n    if (socket != null) {\r\n      socket.emit('name', row);\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```"
