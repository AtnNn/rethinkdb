      "Theoretically, Rethink should do it automatically if you set `useOutdated` to true (see http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/run/). However, I'm not sure how smart the existing algorithms are. We could definitely improve them, and also allow more control to the user as you're suggesting.\r\n\r\nMoving to backlog for now, as this probably won't happen prior to the LTS release."
