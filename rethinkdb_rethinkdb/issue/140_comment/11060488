      "I like the promise style. We're already returning a cursor object that behaves much like the promise object in the example. It preserves the optional nature of the fail callback and the clean, single argument callback style (having one of two arguments to a function defined feels fragile to me). Moreover, it removes a bit of code duplication since the callback is handled directly by the cursor object and the two different run options don't need to support the optional shortcut for setting the success callback.\n\nWe'll be significantly be reworking the drivers with the introduction of the new, cleaner protobuf spec and are using the opportunity to fix a lot of these usability issues too. If it's alright, I'll move this to planned work as part of that project.\n\nThank you very much for your feedback! We can't possibly be experts in everything so we really do depend upon the community for help with this stuff. If you have any more feedback like this please don't hesitate to let us know."
