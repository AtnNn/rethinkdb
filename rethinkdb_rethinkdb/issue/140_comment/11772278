      "Supporting the default convention (err,val) may not feel as clean to some, but it will lead to wider acceptance in my opinion.  And with wider acceptance will come more module implementations using rethinkdb.   Please consider supporting it.   The promise style is a nice option, but the standard callback should be the default.  Hard to tell from this thread which way you may be leaning...hope I'm not too late!  Really like rethinkdb so far!"
