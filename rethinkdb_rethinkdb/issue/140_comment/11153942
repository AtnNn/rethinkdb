      "After talking to a few more users about this, I'd like to escale this for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. This is actually very important for how people write their code, and it impacts applications in a pretty deep way.\r\n2. It's a cosmetic change on the client-side and doesn't depend on the server API.\r\n3. It's a pretty easy fix with massive impact."
