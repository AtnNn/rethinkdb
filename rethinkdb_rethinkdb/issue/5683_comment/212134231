      "Handing this over to @nighelles, since it turns out that there are deeper issues with the `changes` return value computation.\r\n\r\nI think the issue is with this line https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/rdb_protocol/val.cc#L371 where we move a value out of `pkey_to_change`. If multiple entries in the insert batch have the same primary key and the `update` or `replace` conflict-resolution strategy is used, the value might get moved out multiple times."
