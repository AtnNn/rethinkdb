We should eventually support efficient index intersection (which is a neat problem). This is obviously in backlog because:\r\n\r\n* There's far more important low-hanging fruit\r\n* None of the state of the art systems in this space support this\r\n* A lot of technical (language optimizer) work likely needs to be in place before we can do this"
