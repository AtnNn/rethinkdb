      "...Actually I think this doesn't quite work, because you can't put the `r.table.between` into an `r.args` since it's a stream. You could coerce those to an array in the `unionArgs` definition if the result is expected to be small, but that's not ideal.\r\n\r\nThere's probably a slightly different way of getting the same query that works better. Or you could do a part of the query construction logic on the client."
