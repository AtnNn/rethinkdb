      "This depends on the number of users compared to those blacklisted. If it's a relatively small number that are blacklisted you'll effectively do a table scan and simply using a filter is your best option, don't overthink this. If the majority is blacklisted that isn't the case anymore, and I'm not quite sure how you'd best handle that, setting a flag on the user and indexing that would likely be the way to go.\r\n\r\nI'll close this issue since it's not a bug, but feel free to ask more questions here."
