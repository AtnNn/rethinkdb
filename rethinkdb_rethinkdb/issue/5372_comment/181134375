      "I believe there is an issue with your internet connection. The read error is a strong indication of that.\r\n\r\nWith http, those errors have a higher chance of going unnoticed and end up in the file, since there is no additional error checking on the application protocol layer.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, something or someone might be interfering with your connection intentionally.\r\n\r\nCan you also post the DNS entry you get for `download.rethinkdb.com`? It should look like this:\r\n```\r\n$ host -a download.rethinkdb.com\r\n[...]\r\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\r\ndownload.rethinkdb.com.\t1797\tIN\tA\t72.14.189.19\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you get a different A entry or any other entries, the DNS server you're using might be compromised and might be redirecting you to the wrong machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our end, there is only one server (hosted at Linode) that serves `download.rethinkdb.com`, and it's the same server for http and https transfers. Furthermore both serve the same file on the file system. We don't use any CDN."
