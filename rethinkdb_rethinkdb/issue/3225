This should work and should be equivalent to `r.db('test').table_list().map(r.table(r.row).reconfigure(...))`. I assume this just isn't implemented yet (unless there is some problem with this I haven't considered).\n\nWe decided to have this act as if each table had been reconfigured individually with the given parameters.\n"
