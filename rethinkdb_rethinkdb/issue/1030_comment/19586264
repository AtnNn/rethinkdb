      "No.  Currently if you write `r(...)[0]` we turn it into `nth`, but if you write `r(...)[:a]` we turn it into `getattr`.  If you write `r(...)[r(...)]`, we don't know what to turn it into so we throw an argument error.  I'm saying that we should improve that error message to tell people how to fix the problem."
