As I see it, it would be a waste of effort if you as a human have to handle obscurely concatenated variants of function names instead of having your computer reformat them for you.\r\n\r\nAlso the fix for this is almost certainly very easy. We probably just need to modify `parse_backtrace_line()` very slightly."
