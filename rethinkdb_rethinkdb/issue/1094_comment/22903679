      "Let's say I have an object in RethinkDB in the database 'mydb' and the table 'mytable' (I'm working in Node.js):\r\n\r\n     {\r\n         meta: {\r\n             md5: 'something'\r\n         }\r\n     }\r\n\r\nI want to find a specific object called \"something\"; I tried filter like so:\r\n\r\n    var filter = {\r\n        meta: {\r\n            md5: 'something'\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    r.db('mydb').table('mytable').filter(filter)\r\n\r\nAm I doing filter wrong? I think I should make the md5 an index, but I'm curious about my use of filter and whether it is correct.\r\n\r\nFilter returns with no results, even if there are multiple entries with the same value."
