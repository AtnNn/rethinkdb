      "Thanks @al3xandru \r\n\r\n1. Now the docs in the data explorer and the API page are the same, so I'm not sure that it's really relevant to have a link to the API page. But if we have a \"short versions\" of docs for the data explorer, it's definitively a good idea.\r\n\r\n2. I think adding too many colors is a bad idea (blue for 1. and red for 2.).\r\nAlso the reason why the db/table names are red is because it's a string, not because it's an argument\r\nBut I can of see why you would want that. Eclipse and IntelliJ add some colors in the suggestions. \r\n\r\n3. Yes, good idea.\r\n\r\n4. Writing \"example\" instead of \"ex\" is just longer, and we have a small popover, so I'm not really sure about that. But I'm not really opposed to.\r\n\r\n5. The examples already have a fixed-width font (Inconsolata, monospace). At some point (before releasing 1.2 I think), I tried to use a normal font for the description and a monospace font for the code snippets, but it wasn't looking good, so I just put everything with a monospace font.\r\n\r\n6. That would require to add examples and tweak a little the docs system, but I think it's a good idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving users click on a link can be a little tricky when a suggestion is not selected yet, but that's my problem. I'll find a way to do it.\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky @coffeemug any thoughts on @al3xandru's feedback?"
