      "2 colors is too many colors? Currently the only emphasis in the suggester is some bolded grey and the underlined Ex. My eyes are not able to quickly anchor on the important details. \r\n\r\nIn the suggester that are a couple of important anchors:\r\n\r\n1. function name\r\n2. parameters\r\n3. description\r\n4. example\r\n\r\nIf my eyes cannot distinguish these immediately, then IMO the suggester is good, but not fantastic.
