        "My PR for #5525 adds dump/restore to/from stdout/stdin which already helps to implement the `ssh otherhost rethinkdb-dump --file=- | rethinkdb-restore - --force` workflow I had in mind.\r\n\r\nBut since `dump`/`restore` are still based on the `export`/`import` commands, which are directory based, it still writes temporary files, both for `dump` and `restore`.\r\n\r\nThere are situations when you don't want that for security reasons, e.g. if you want to use the `ssh otherhost rethinkdb-dump --file=- | rethinkdb-restore - --force` workflow to ensure the data is never written to (potentially unencrypted) disk anywhere, not even temporary files.\r\n\r\nTo cover this case, we would have to switch the `export`/`import` commands to support a streaming fashion, and then use them accordingly from `dump`/`restore`."
