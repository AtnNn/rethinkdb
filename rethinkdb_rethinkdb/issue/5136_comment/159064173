      "There was no GCC-4.8 installed on newton this morning, so installed one to `/opt/gcc-4.8.5` and created symlinks in `/usr/local/bin`.\r\n\r\nIt had no problem building RethinkDB. Running the resulting binary required the correct `libstdc++` which it was taught to find by setting the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/gcc-4.8.5/lib64`.\r\n\r\nIt would be very easy to make those libraries available systme-wide. I didn't because it might cause the GCC 4.8 libraries to interfere with GCC 4.6. That is also why I haven't installed GCC 4.8 from the PPA at http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-toolchain-r/test."
