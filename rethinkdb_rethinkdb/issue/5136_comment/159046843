      "@AtnNn Have you tried using the GCC 4.8 that's installed on `newton`?\r\nEvery time I tried to do that I had to preload a certain version of `libc` I think (or was it `libstdc++`?), because the one installed was too old. Maybe we just need to install a different GCC 4.8 build?\r\n\r\nSome versions of GCC 4.7 have crashing bugs on our code base during compilation, so I'd definitely suggest switching directly to GCC 4.8 and skipping 4.7."
