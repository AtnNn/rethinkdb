      "The animation on the website is just that, an animation for illustrational purposes (though as you saw it is procedurally generated in this case).\r\nIt's just like the reads/sec and writes/sec graphs further down in the \"Scale your cluster in seconds\" section.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for making this clearer? Do you think it would help if we added the word \"simulation\" to the animation?\r\n\r\n(also pinging @mglukhovsky)"
