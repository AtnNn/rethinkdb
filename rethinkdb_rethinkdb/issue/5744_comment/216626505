      "let me count the ways:\r\n1. don't claim that the widget is showcasing \"Streaming RethinkDB results...\".\r\n2. don't put a flashing green light in the design that suggests the widget is live\r\n3. don't name the classes in the markup \"realtime-queries\", \"query-results\", and \"messages\"\r\n4. don't name the symbols in your code things like \"add_realtime_query_message\" that might lead the developer in passing to believe the code might actually be adding a realtime query message as the name of the function suggests.\r\n\r\ni spent time looking at the network panel in my browser trying to understand how your implementation worked before digging deeper to find this source code.  i believe (and validated this assumption with others here in my coworking space) that any reasonable person who encounters your home page would expect this to be a working demo of your technology, since, after all, you claim that it is.\r\n\r\nthis widget was clearly designed - with a carefully written 150 sloc marketing effort - to make others believe it is a showcase of your technology.  it would be pointless addition to the website otherwise: any developer knows how to \"push\" to an array.\r\n \r\nto remedy the situation, why don't you simply use your tech there?"
