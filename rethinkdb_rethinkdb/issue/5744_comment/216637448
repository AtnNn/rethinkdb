      "you did, in fact, deceive me.  i believed, since you claimed your demo was \"Streaming RethinkDB Results\", that it was in fact streaming those results.  the reason i started looking deeper is because the difference is not trivial at all; as your company is well aware, there are a number of engineering challenges associated with the various \"push\" technologies from short polling, long polling, http streaming, websockets, et. al, and i was looking to see how this was being done so smoothly.\r\n\r\ni'll happily soften the title of this ticket to make it reflect my observation.  but it is my belief that, if part of a website claims to be streaming results from a database, in fact it should be."
