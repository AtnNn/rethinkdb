      "Reading this issue makes me very upset. We work hard every single day to build a great product that tries to push the boundaries of what's technically possible and make developers's live easier. We then give it away for free and make the source code available to anyone who wants it. It's very important to us to have a close relationship with the developer community that makes it all possible, and seeing accusations of deliberate deception really hurts. In the future, could you please ask about our intentions when you make a suggestion before implying deception?\r\n\r\nWith respect to the actual illustration, the goal is to demonstrate what RethinkDB does and how it works from the user's point of view. The product *actually* does exactly what's illustrated, so I think the illustration accomplishes its goal without any deception. It would have been deceptive if RethinkDB didn't do what the illustration purports, but that isn't the case here. I agree it would be nicer to stream data from a real live instance, but given that we have limited resources I don't think the cost of maintaining a live RethinkDB instance, connecting to it from every client, and serving the data live is justified given that the javascript code already exists and accomplishes the same goal.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue because the title is inflammatory, and we have a policy of not changing titles to avoid confusing email users. If anyone feels like switching to a live instance is a worthwhile undertaking, please open another issue and we'll prioritize it as part of our normal scheduling process."
