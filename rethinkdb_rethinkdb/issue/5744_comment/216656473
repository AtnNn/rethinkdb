      "my critique was not directed towards any individual, but towards what i perceived to be yet another corporate marketing department wasting the time and money of consumers by playing fast and loose with the facts.  i was impressed by how well the product was working... until i discovered it wasn't working at all.  it was after this discovery, and with the objective of creating some sort of accountability, that i filed this ticket:  i could easily see a new developer or company executive, given the way the widget was presented and the classes/functions/variables were named, making a decision to purchase this product based on the performance of what they believed to be a demo (every person who works with me, when shown the page, believed it was \"live\" as well).\r\n\r\nin the spirit of providing constructive feedback, i might suggest merely replacing the \"STREAMING RETHINKDB RESULTS..\" with \"WILL STREAM THE RESULTS...\" or maybe even \"STREAMS THE RESULTS...\" without the \"live\" light.  i think that would make it clear enough.\r\n\r\nfwiw, i do think, if the product performs well across difference browsers, devices, and networks, that dropping in a frame with a working client of your service, provided you can find/create an adequate data stream, would be quite compelling."
