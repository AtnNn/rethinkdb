      "@haf In addition to the `--no-update-check`, I also recommend turning off update checks in the web UI if you're using it. You can get to that option by clicking on the small gear icon at the top. That setting is stored in a cookie, so you'll need to turn it off in each browser you're using and for each RethinkDB server URL you're accessing (if there are multiple).\r\nLong term we will make the web UI update notification use the server-side mechanism, so that supplying `--no-update-check` is going to disable both. We just haven't gotten around to that yet."
