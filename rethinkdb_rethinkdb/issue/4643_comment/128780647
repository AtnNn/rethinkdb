      "This is just the server checking in with ours for two reasons:\r\n1. Checking to see if there is a newer version\r\n2. Giving us some rough usage numbers so we can prioritize development (so order-of-magnitude on number of servers and tables, etc..)\r\n\r\nTo disable this you can supply the `--no-update-check` flag and no such connection will be made.\r\n\r\nOn the assumption that this solves your worry I am going to close this issue, but if I am wrong please re-open it."
