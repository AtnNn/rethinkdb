        "I have a cluster of four servers based on `next`.\r\nI created 400 tables in the `test` database, and then ran\r\n`r.db('test').reconfigure({shards: 8, replicas: 4})`\r\n\r\nTwo things happened:\r\n* One of the servers started using a lot of memory. According to `htop`, it used in the range of 20 GB, with >40 GB virtual memory allocated to that process. I think this part is ok, though at some point we might want to look into it (and maybe throttle the query or something).\r\n* The server started printing lots of these messages: `<jemalloc>: Error in munmap(): Cannot allocate memory`. It kept running though and everything still seems to be fine after the reconfiguration has finished.\r\n\r\nThree questions:\r\n* What does this message mean exactly?\r\n* If an allocation failed, why is the server not crashing? Is jemalloc internally recovering from it somehow?\r\n* If this is just a sort of warning without any consequences, can we suppress it?"
