      "Another question:  Do responses arrive in the same order over the wire as queries?\r\n\r\nql2.proto implies that the response will always have a token that corresponds to a query's token, which suggests the answer could be no.  It also says to send a CONTINUE with the same token as a response, which suggests the answer would have to be yes."
