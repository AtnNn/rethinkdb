      "Eager loading of result batches would require adding significant extra complexity to the python driver. It also doesn't really jive with the otherwise lazy nature of RethinkDB query execution. Someday we may build a high performance, thread safe, asynchronous API supporting, connection pooling Python driver but even then I don't know if we want to implement eager loading of future result sets as it would entail forcing the server to compute results the application may not be interested in. Even the JS driver, which already is forced to support a complex, asynchronous query API and so has the necessary infrastructure doesn't do this for precisely this reason."
