      "Because responses have to arrive in the same order as requests, the Ruby driver's sending of a preemptive `CONTINUE` will cause subsequent requests to block until the `CONTINUE` response has been sent.  This can easily drastically worsen user experience of web page response times (i.e. by doubling the time before data begins loading).\r\n\r\nThis issue is all backwards.  The problem here, assuming the server will not change, is the Ruby driver, which should not preemptively try to load extra data.\r\n\r\nThere are other problems that can affect response times in the protocol, too, in that the server could support replying out of order, or in that large batches or large objects can clog up network traffic with big solid protobuf blobs, but there are other issues about that."
