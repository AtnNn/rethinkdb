      "I think accepting a file path for the certificate file like it does now is slightly nicer (and it makes it more consistent with the other drivers).\r\n\r\nWould it be a big problem to change the file loading to `readFile`? From looking at the API it looks pretty straight forward (you could wrap it into a promise I think to avoid the separate callback, @deontologician could help you with that).\r\n\r\nThere are definitely a few users who open new connections very frequently, so I would prefer if the driver behaved well under that scenario.\r\n@jipperinbham if you don't want to do this change don't worry. We can do it ourselves after the merge."
