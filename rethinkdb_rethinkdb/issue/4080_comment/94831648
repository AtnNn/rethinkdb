      "IMHO that would be over-optimization, how many times are we opening connections to rethinkdb for that to become a problem because of readFileSync ?\r\n\r\nAlso, why not follow the same signature of [tls.connect](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_port_host_options_callback) and accept an options object that will be passed all the way to tls.connect (because it's what will be used underneath right ?) ? The options object is an object that may have `ca` and `cert` parameters that may be strings or buffers, so we pass on to the user the option of how to obtain those (they decide to use fs.readFile or fs.readFileSync). It would be a lot cleaner IMHO, [it's about 10 SLOC](https://github.com/joaojeronimo/rethinkdbdash/blob/master/lib/connection.js#L41).\r\n\r\n(very sorry about just making suggestions and no pull requests but I don't write coffeescript)"
