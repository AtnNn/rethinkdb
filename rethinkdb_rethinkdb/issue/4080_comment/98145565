      "@danielmewes I've made a [change](https://github.com/compose/rethinkdb/commit/1a80811a2911e492be03f8ca342fbdca3b4d2ac3) that I think is best given how different node is and the differences in how users may want to connect. It's what @joaojeronimo and I discussed above and it's also how my [PR](https://github.com/dancannon/gorethink/pull/179) to the gorethink driver is setup. \r\n\r\nSince the python and ruby drivers setup the SSL/TLS connection differently, I think it's ok to have the connect options differ slightly.
