      "> I think would expect to automatically coerce a grouped_data to a datum (since we return it by default as a simple array in the drivers).\r\n\r\nI don't want to go back and revisit the decision right now, but this way of thinking about GROUPED_STREAM and GROUPED_DATA is one of the reasons I don't like turning it into an array in the JS driver.  It makes it feel like a normal datum, when it isn't handled that way at all by the server."
