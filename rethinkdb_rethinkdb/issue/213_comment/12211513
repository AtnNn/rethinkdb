      "@mlucy The JS evaluation code was changed such that the `return` statement is no longer necessary. My guess is that the updates to the ruby driver did not get pushed along with the updates to the server. If so, the ruby driver would still be helpfully inserting return statements in front of JS code snippets. Since the new server behavior is to essentially call eval on the code snipped you're get an illegal return statement error if one happens to be in there."
