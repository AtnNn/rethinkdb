      "Yes as far as I know the example above doesn't work because the string of\r\njavascript won't be interpreted as a function. However if you do:\r\n\r\n    r.js(\"return this.key.match(\\\"foo\\\"))\r\n\r\nYou get a function which behaves as you want. This works in ruby as well as\r\nJavaScript and python.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, January 12, 2013, Charl Matthee wrote:\r\n\r\n> Is there a way to accomplish this if I am using the ruby driver?\r\n>\r\n> \8212\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub<https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/213#issuecomment-12189786>.\r\n>\r\n>"
