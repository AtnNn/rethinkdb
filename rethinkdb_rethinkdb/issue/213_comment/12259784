      "@wmrowan I think the js() option is fine (and the only option) for now but having to resort to calling js from within ruby to query the db seems like a leaky API. If I am using ruby (python, etc.) to access RethinkDB my driver should be built around idiomatic ruby (python, etc.) instead of having to resort to calling out to js which is an implementation detail that should be hidden from me (unless I need bare metal access to it of course ;).\r\n\r\nThe native matching primitive @coffeemug is suggesting seems to be the right way to go."
