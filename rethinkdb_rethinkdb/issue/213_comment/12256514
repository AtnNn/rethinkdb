      "@charl Would you say that using `r.js` solves the underlying problem or would you still like to see regex matching added as a built in feature? This actually seems to be the kind of operation that `r.js` was intended for and isn't necessarily any more verbose than a native alternative, especially considering the upcoming syntax changes. Soon you'll be able to write a regex match (in the JS driver) like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table(...).filter(r.js(function(row) {\r\n    return row.url.match(/regex/);\r\n}))\r\n```"
