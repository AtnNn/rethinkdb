(version on disk: 6)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a RethinkDB user not familiar with the core, \"6\" doesn't mean anything useful to me and the client could not remember what version of RethinkDB they were using previously. \r\n\r\nI was able to track it down [here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/bb735c63c7560bc6737656fd504068ff56917c5a/src/version.hpp#L20), but I realized it would be very useful as a developer if RethinkDB also included in matching RethinkDB version.\r\n\r\nPossibly like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: Data version not recognized. Is the data directory from a newer version of RethinkDB? \r\nVersion on disk: 6 (matches with RethinkDB 2.1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is potentially related to #2657, but it looks like the issue was considered resolved there.\r\n\r\n"
