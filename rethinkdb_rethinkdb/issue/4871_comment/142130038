      "I added an initializer for `mode_(backfill_mode_t::PAUSED)` and moved the `tracker_.reset()` down to the line `mode_ = backfill_mode_t::STREAMING`, and I can't reproduce the crash anymore.  Unfortunately, this shouldn't make a difference because this code should have a write lock on `cleanup_rwlock_`, and the backtrace above should have a read lock."
