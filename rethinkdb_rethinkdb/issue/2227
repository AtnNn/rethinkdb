        "The blob code has a few problems.\r\n\r\n1. Deleting a blob doesn't load the requisite blocks in parallel (the way reading a blob does).  It loads them in order.\r\n\r\n~~2. Lots of very fragile append/prepend logic, which could be a lot simpler considering that we no longer append, unappend, prepend, or unprepend  from blobs.  (Edit: In sam_2130, prepend/unprepend and its shifting logic is removed.)  (Edit: Fixed -- we just have append/unappend logic, which is much simpler.)~~\r\n\r\n~~3. Some gratuitously large memcpy's that are fragile with respect to #2130, smaller in-memory block sizes.  (Edit: Fixed in sam_2130 as of 2caa20599763befb21bffc587c4d74e3b345b38d.)~~\r\n\r\n(Edit: I don't want to remove the append/unappend logic from blobs, and I won't, because I think it potentially has value.)"
