        "When implementing `reconfigure()`, I changed how the suggester algorithm worked. This has an unfortunate side effect that it sometimes won't distribute replicas over all machines properly. For example, in #2957 @neumino reported that it generated the following configuration for a cluster of five machines:\r\n```\r\n{u'shards': [{u'directors': [u'Ananke', u'Apollo'],\r\n              u'replicas': [u'Ananke', u'Apollo']},\r\n             {u'directors': [u'Apollo', u'Ananke'],\r\n              u'replicas': [u'Ananke', u'Apollo']},\r\n             {u'directors': [u'Asteria', u'Lapetus'],\r\n              u'replicas': [u'Asteria', u'Lapetus']}]}\r\n```\r\nWe should fix this."
