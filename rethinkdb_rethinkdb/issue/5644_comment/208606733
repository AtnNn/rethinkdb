      "It looks like the behavior prior to the change that introduced the crash was to treat `squash: true` and `squash: false` identically for artificial tables, with semantics that are most similar to `squash: true` for real tables, but with implementation details in the `changefeed` namespace identical to `squash: false`.  I think we should go back to that behavior."
