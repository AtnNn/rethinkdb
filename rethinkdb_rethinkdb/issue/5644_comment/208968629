      "If you end up building this week, I recommend someone take a look at https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5622 first. For 2.3.0, I literally waited until buildbot was done with the checkout step, and then went into its temporary directory and edited the scripts/gen_version.sh script to not add `-dirty` before it started compiling the server. You can do it again the same way of course, but at least need to be aware of it."
