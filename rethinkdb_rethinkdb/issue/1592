Users will be able to quickly select a table (by typing the table name or by selecting from a list) and browse through the documents in the table.\n\nLater versions will support visually editing data, potentially graphing it, etc. but the first version will allow conveniently browsing data without having to type queries.\n\nAssigning to @neumino, most of the info on how this will work is in his, my, and @mglukhovsky's mind as of now.\n"
