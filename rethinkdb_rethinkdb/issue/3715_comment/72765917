      "We could update the protobuf to have both a `ResponseType` (what it has now) **and** a `ResponseNotes` field.  We would then remove `SUCCESS_FEED` and `SUCCESS_ATOM_FEED` (they would both go back to being `SUCCESS_PARTIAL`).  `ResponseNotes` would be an array of enum values where we could put any information we want that isn't essential to writing a functioning driver but might allow people to implement extra functionality."
