      "Would we need more types like this for other types of upcoming changefeeds? What about `group().changes()` changefeeds for example?\r\n\r\nI'm a bit concerned that we will end up with lots of different return types for different sorts of changefeeds, in which case we should probably think about a different way of passing the \"changefeed type\" to the client.\r\n\r\n@neumino any opinions or insights on this?"
