Sending it as a DATUM term results in the \"Invalid data collector.\" compile error.\r\nThis is counter-intuitive for driver developers, as the object is actually completely static.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to fix this:\r\n1. Add a note about this in the documentation\r\n2. Make the server accept both variants"
