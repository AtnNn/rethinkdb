        "I've made some inserts performance testing (using durability:'soft') and I've noticed that when the cache is 100% (I have no idea what does it mean, I can only guess its a temporary buffer used to store inserts in memory until writted to disk), it causing the insert speed to be about 50% than before.\r\nI thought that it might be causing due to high insert rates, but the bad part is that the cache is keep being on 100% even if I stop using the database, and will only clear when stopping the process and raising it up, so it means that after a few seconds/minutes, there will be permanent performance issue.\r\n\r\nI can use the --cache-size flag, but it will only give more time until 100% of the cache will be used, but when it will hit 100% I will get the same effect as before.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"969\" alt=\"performance-on-100-cache\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1299681/15804412/b4c9cd32-2b0f-11e6-9e88-573b88713d78.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n"
