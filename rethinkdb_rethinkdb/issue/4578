        "Since reql has such a regular syntax (not quite lisp, but... pretty regular), we could probably add some [paredit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6h5dFyyUX0)-like keyboard shortcuts to make editing really nice.\n\nFor an example of how this might look in javascript, the same emacs guy wrote js2-refactor, which adds paredit abilities for the javascript emacs mode:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7yMWD1wUu4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJEP1j1UTRk\n\nSome operations I often do which are annoying currently and would become a lot nicer (the pipe is the cursor):\n- jump the cursor back term by term\n\n``` js\nr.tableCreate(\"foo\")|\n// jump command (could optionally select the previous term so you can overwrite it)\nr.|tableCreate(\"foo\")\n```\n- wrap the current query in a function wrapped term\n\n``` js\nr.tableCreate(\"foo\");|\n// wrap command\nr.|(function(val) {\n    return r.tableCreate(\"foo\")\n});\n```\n- r.row to function\n\n``` js\nr.something(r.row('foo')|);\n// to function\nr.something(function(row){ return row('foo')})\n```\n- add index\n\n``` js\nr.someExpression().orderBy(\"foo\"|)\n// add index\nr.someExpression().orderBy({index: \"foo\"})\n```\n- wrap term with parens. Would be useful for adding things like `r.desc` etc. Would place the cursor before the opening paren\n\n``` js\nr.someExpr().orderBy(\"foo\"|)\n// wrap term with parens\nr.someExpr().orderBy(|(\"foo\"))\n```\n\nI think that gives the flavor.\n"
