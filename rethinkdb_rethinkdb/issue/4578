        "Since reql has such a regular syntax (not quite lisp, but... pretty regular), we could probably add some [paredit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6h5dFyyUX0)-like keyboard shortcuts to make editing really nice.\r\n\r\nFor an example of how this might look in javascript, the same emacs guy wrote js2-refactor, which adds paredit abilities for the javascript emacs mode:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7yMWD1wUu4\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJEP1j1UTRk\r\n\r\nSome operations I often do which are annoying currently and would become a lot nicer (the pipe is the cursor):\r\n\r\n* jump the cursor back term by term\r\n```js\r\nr.tableCreate(\"foo\")|\r\n// jump command (could optionally select the previous term so you can overwrite it)\r\nr.|tableCreate(\"foo\")\r\n```\r\n* wrap the current query in a function wrapped term\r\n```js\r\nr.tableCreate(\"foo\");|\r\n// wrap command\r\nr.|(function(val) {\r\n    return r.tableCreate(\"foo\")\r\n});\r\n```\r\n* r.row to function\r\n```js\r\nr.something(r.row('foo')|);\r\n// to function\r\nr.something(function(row){ return row('foo')})\r\n```\r\n* add index\r\n```js\r\nr.someExpression().orderBy(\"foo\"|)\r\n// add index\r\nr.someExpression().orderBy({index: \"foo\"})\r\n```\r\n* wrap term with parens. Would be useful for adding things like `r.desc` etc. Would place the cursor before the opening paren\r\n```js\r\nr.someExpr().orderBy(\"foo\"|)\r\n// wrap term with parens\r\nr.someExpr().orderBy(|(\"foo\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that gives the flavor."
