      "You just need to add semicolons:\r\n```js\r\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"foo\").filter((d) => {\r\n  console.log(d);\r\n  return true;\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever this code is not going to do what you want it to do, since the JavaScript function is executed only once in the Data Explorer with `d` being a placeholder object, and is then sent over to the server as a ReQL function where it actually gets executed on each document (http://rethinkdb.com/blog/lambda-functions/ has all the details if you're interested). There is currently no equivalent to `console.log` in ReQL. We will probably add it at some point in the future though, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/329 ."
