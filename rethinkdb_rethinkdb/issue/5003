        "Right now the testing for the java driver is fairly un-integrated with the rest of the stuff we have.\r\n\r\nA couple things off the top of my head that are wrong with it:\r\n\r\n1. It isn't possible to invoke the java tests through test-runner\r\n2. It expects you to pass in the server info through the `test-config-override.properties` file. It should get them from the command line or environment variables.\r\n  - this involves changing how gradle test runs the tests or how TestingCommon.java gets the info\r\n3. The script that converts the tests (`convert_tests.py`) is needs to be run before the tests are run, there's currently no make target or gradle rule that does this, I've been doing it manually\r\n4. (Maybe long-term) buildbot running the tests\r\n5. There's an error currently when running `gradle test -i` that the logging configuration isn't found. This should be fixed, I didn't have time to get to it."
