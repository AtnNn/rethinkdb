      "Making queries `pickle`-able is a really good idea. But looking at this I think that rather that the root problem is that we don't expose the class we are using. Since the classes in question provide only a minor addition to `RqlConstant`, and all have just a single instance that we use, that it would be better to just make instances of `RqlConstant` that have the two attributes that we want them to have (`tt` and `st`).\r\n\r\nI have a version that does this in branch `larkost/5875-python-pickling`, @wwoods would you mind seeing if that solves your use case as well? If you don't want to check it out through `git` I will be happy to send you a built version."
