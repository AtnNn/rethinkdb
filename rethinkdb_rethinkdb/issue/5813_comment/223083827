      "What about cases where you want a modifier function in the vast majority of cases (including new stuff that developers write) but want to skip it for just this one weird query? (e.g., table is append and delete only, but you want to rewrite all rows once with an `.update({\"_notimportant_\":true}); .update({\"_notimportant_\": r.literal()})`, and you'd like to keep your modifiers in place during that process.)\r\n\r\nShould we have an optarg to `insert`/`update` to optionally skip the modifier functions? Do you need `config` permissions to use the optarg? Or is this too subtle and unknown territory to put into the first version?"
