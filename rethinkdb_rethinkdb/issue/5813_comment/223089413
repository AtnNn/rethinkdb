      "@encryptio Interesting, I think that could be very useful.\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure what the permission requirements for the override should be.\r\n\r\nIf we allow everyone with write permissions to ignore the modifier, that would obviously rule out modifiers as a security feature. On the other hand they will be really limited for that purpose in the current proposal anyway, and their main use case is a different one.\r\n\r\nRequiring `config` permissions for it would be safe, and might actually make sense since most cases I can think of where you would want to ignore the modifier are administrative operations."
