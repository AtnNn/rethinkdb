      "@neumino: Thanks, I scheduled #151 for the `reql_admin` milestone.\r\n\r\nI don't think that #1905 is related to `reql_admin`. Accidentally merging two clusters is awkward with or without the `reql_admin` changes. I don't think that the proposed `reql_admin` changes will make accidental merges more likely or make the consequences any worse than they already are."
