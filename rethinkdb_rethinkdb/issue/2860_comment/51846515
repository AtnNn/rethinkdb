      "Currently the renaming system will always pick an unused name. So if there are two tables named `foo` and one named `foo_renamed`, one of the `foo` tables will become `foo_renamed2`. But I can see how the user might want a table called `foo_renamed`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we don't currently allow `$` signs in table names."
