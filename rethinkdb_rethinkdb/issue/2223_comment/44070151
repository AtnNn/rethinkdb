      "Wouldn't it be a better idea to return a native node stream (which simply requires subclassing stream.Readable and calling `this.push()` inside it) to be compatible with the thousands of node stream libraries that already exist? For example, this could be used with the great `through` module to transform cursor streams as they flow from the database, and (for example), could be used to pipe documents somewhere else, like a http response.\r\n\r\nAdhering to the node stream spec is a little bit of overhead for a lot of gain"
