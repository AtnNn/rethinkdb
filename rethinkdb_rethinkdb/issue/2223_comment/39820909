      "> Once you call `on`, we'll add methods like `next`, `toArray` on the cursor object such that people won't be able to use both interfaces.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand what you mean here. Could you be more specific about what you want to see happen if the user calls `on` followed by `next` or `toArray`? Do incompatible functions throw an error? Also, could you provide the complete list of incompatible functions?\r\n\r\n> We'll add things like `once`, `removeListener`, `removeAllListener` etc.\r\n\r\nCould you specify a complete list with headers and descriptions more precisely? Also, if I call `once` and get a ping, presumably I can use `next`/`toArray`/etc. again?\r\n\r\nAssuming we polish up the details above, I think the proposal is good. Personally, I think we should wait before we ship 1.13 to get this done, for a couple of reasons:\r\n\r\n- I disagree that we need this for feeds. I think the existing cursor API will work just fine, and the only way to know is to ship and see. If people don't like it, we can ship this very quickly, but it's always better to test first before adding APIs.\r\n- It adds some complexity which I think is unnecessary. Before we add complexity, we should always make sure people really want it.\r\n- The feed examples won't be easily translatable from JS to other languages. I think we should only do that if we're 100% sure it's worth it, and it's not clear to me that it's the case here. The difference is purely syntactic and isn't that big."
