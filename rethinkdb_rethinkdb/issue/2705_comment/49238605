      "Also note @mlucy's comment:\r\n\r\n> The problem with making optargs \"statically evaluated\" is that they have to be a datum, and right now we let people specify terms as optarags (e.g. for the default database).  I'm also not convinced that we won't want more non-datum optargs in the future.  For example, we let people pass a function to the `default` optarg of `filter`; I could see letting people specify functions in global optargs.  Maybe a batching strategy?  Maybe an error handler?\r\n>\r\nI think the easiest thing to do would be to just evaluate the optargs in a context where no other optargs are defined."
