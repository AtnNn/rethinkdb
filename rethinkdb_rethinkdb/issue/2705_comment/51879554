      "Quite.  The problem basically is this: to compile an expression, we must parse the datums from the protobufs or analogous representation.  To do that, we must have already evaluated some of the optargs (the particular one that motivated this was the `array_limits` optarg, because the protobuf may specify a literal array that is in excess of the limit).  Evaluating those optargs requires parsing the datums from the protobufs or analogous representation, which is a full circle.  For `array_limits` we hacked it for compile time, but this is kind of an ugly thing, and we're retaining it on the global optargs because maybe kinda we might want it for future expansion?"
