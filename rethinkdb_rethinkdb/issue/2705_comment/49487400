      "> I would also be OK with evaluating the optargs upon arrival at the server, in a context where no other optargs are defined, and then passing around the evaluated values.\r\n\r\nThat sounds good to me too, provided that we allow them to evaluate to `val_t`s as well as `datum_t`s (so that we can e.g. have a function specified as a global optarg)."
