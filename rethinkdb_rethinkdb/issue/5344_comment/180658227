      "@mglukhovsky\r\n> do both delete buttons include a second confirmation step?\r\n\r\nYes. The \"Delete selected tables\" button lists the tables in a modal and requires an additional confirmation click.\r\nThe \"Delete database\" button actually makes you enter the database name before you can continue.\r\n\r\nSince the issue is about accidentally deleting the database instead of the selected tables, things should be very safe in practice because of the confirmation step that database deletion involves.\r\n\r\nStill we should probably change this of course."
