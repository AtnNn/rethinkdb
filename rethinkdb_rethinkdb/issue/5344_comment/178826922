      "I believe these were changed in the web UI rewrite (correct, @deontologician?) -- we originally hid these under an \"operations\" button to avoid this kind of confusion.\r\n\r\nTwo different ways we could improve this:\r\n  - make the header sticky, so as you scroll past, you still see the header with the global buttons\r\n  - move \"delete selected tables\" to each database, and have it appear only once you start checking off items\r\n\r\n@danielmewes: do both `delete` buttons include a second confirmation step?"
