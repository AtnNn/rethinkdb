      "I thought there was a PR that added one of these buttons, but I can't find it so maybe I was thinking of something else. The biggest issue is that delete database is next to add table and add database is next to delete tables. So we could also switch it so that the table operations are in the database block, and the database operations are at the top. This would probably require a checkbox for the database blocks, or a way to select the right database in the modal"
