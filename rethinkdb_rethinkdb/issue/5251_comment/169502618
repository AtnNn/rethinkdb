      "Whoops, I tried to write these in a way that would be language-agnostic and didn't know about the `r.row` limitation in the Ruby driver. PR is up with the fix.\r\n\r\n@deontologician @larkost could we add Ruby 2.2 to the default `rb` interpreter? That's what ships with OSX as the system default now and I didn't notice they weren't passing before submitting my previous PR (since I just ran `./test-runner polyglot/aggregation`)."
