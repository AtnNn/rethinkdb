      "I am trying to keep the base default interpreter to the lowest version of every language (so: py2.6, rb1.9, and node0.12 [1]). That being said, if you just use the default it will search for the first version that you have installed (on MacOS is would be py2.6, rb2.0, and an error for Node). This is deliberate as our problems more often come out of older versions of interpreters rather than newer. I do make regular runs of all of our supported interpreters, so cover all my bases.\r\n\r\n[1] The Java testing is not yet integrated, but it will wind up with Java1.8"
