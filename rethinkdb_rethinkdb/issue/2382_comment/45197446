      "Yes, sorry for not updating. As the official name of the corporation is Hexagram 49, Inc.,  they will only allow that to be used on the certificate.  DBAs are not allowed, so unless we change the name, the certificate will continue to use the official name.\r\n\r\nUnless there are any questions or alternate ideas, I'd like to close this issue."
