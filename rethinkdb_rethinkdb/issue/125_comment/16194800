      "Are we certain we want to do this?\r\n\r\nWe usually only return a stream for lazy operations, where it makes a lot of sense and the size of the stream isn't very important.\r\n\r\n`gmr`, though, has to use an array internally, so if people have hundreds of thousands of groups it's going to absolutely kill the server.  Worse, if we return a batched iterator we'll have to keep the array around in memory until it's exhausted.\r\n\r\nIf we make `gmr` return a stream, users will have no easy way of knowing that it's a bad idea to have a bajillion groups."
