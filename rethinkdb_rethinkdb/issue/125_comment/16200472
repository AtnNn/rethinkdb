      "I think that basically doing a `gmr` with millions of groups is impractical whether or not we return a stream. Basically we're just sacrificing memory on the server machine for memory on the driver machine (which in many cases are the same machine) which doesn't have a good smell to it.\r\n\r\nI feel like having a cap on the memory of a query which we already need to do is the real way to solve this problem."
