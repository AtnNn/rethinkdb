      "As a side note: I've seen the capped memory approach mentioned in Mongo's docs (I think it was for orderby). Keeping in mind that such a query requiring a lot of memory on the server will impact all other queries, I'd feel better with:\r\n\r\n1. the operation would throw by default if the threshold is overpassed\r\n2. the operation would be run ignoring the threshold iif a special parameter is passed in\r\n\r\n    `grouped_map_reduce(...).run(conn, ignore_mem_threshold=True)` "
