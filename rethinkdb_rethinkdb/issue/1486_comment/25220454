      "Hi @mafrosis.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no plan for providing debian packages.\r\n\r\nI think you have identified a bug in the ubuntu packages: the dependency on v8 should specify an exact version and not a vague `>= 3.1`. I believe the lucid package works for you because it statically links to v8.\r\n\r\nDoes the list of command you just posted work without installing `python-software-properties`?\r\n\r\nThanks."
