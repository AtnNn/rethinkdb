      "So, basically, if I'm not using changefeeds, I can open multiple clients and trigger the query many times in short succession, and all of them return rather quickly (~5 seconds or less). The same is roughly true when I use changefeeds but omit the `union`s.\r\n\r\nHowever, including one `union` causes each query to take much longer to complete (once the changefeeds have been created), while two unions make it take even longer.\r\n\r\nSo, initially, I had thought `merge` gave me better results (and it had seemed that way), but now I can't seem to replicate that. I may have been fooled by changefeed results being sent.\r\n\r\nIf you can get the example running, you can see the slowdown by running about four copies of the client. Once the changefeeds are set up, selecting a different option in one of the drop-downs triggers a query, but it takes quite a while to complete. Selecting different options in all of the drop-downs seems to make it take even longer.\r\n\r\nI also tested it with the setting up of three changefeeds for the query (one for each table), and that seemed to be better. My expectation is that `union` in a changefeed should have an additive impact on performance, but it seems to be greater than that."
