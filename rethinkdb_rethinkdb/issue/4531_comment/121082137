      "Ah, OK.  So you're saying that if you'recontinuously opening changefeeds on `.union(map)` and then you send a non-changefeed `.union(map)` query, that the non-changefeed query takes a long time to return?\r\n\r\nThat's interesting.  I don't think there's anything particular to `map` that would make that expected behavior.\r\n\r\nThanks for the bug report, we'll look into it!\r\n"
