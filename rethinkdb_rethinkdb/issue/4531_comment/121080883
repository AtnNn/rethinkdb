      "@mlucy Sorry, in retrospect, I was a little unclear.\r\n\r\nBasically, I have a page that lets the user run one the query for one value of `userId` on page load, and then trigger another run of the query for a different value of `userId`. Once the query is complete, the query is used with `.changes` to subscribe the user to those changes.\r\n\r\nSo, when I omit the changefeeds, multiple clients can trigger the query many times, in short succession, and it runs pretty quickly each time. When I add the changefeeds, however, triggering the same query takes an increasingly long time. It does eventually resolve, but after tens of seconds, and minutes, in some cases.\r\n\r\nThe second query behaves fine, whether there are outstanding changefeeds or not."
