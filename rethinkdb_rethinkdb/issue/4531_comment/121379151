      "So, it seems like I may have been mistaken; `merge` doesn't seem to have  a performance advantage over `map` -- rather, it seems the source of the slowdown is the `union`. Removing that and just using one part of the query makes the whole thing much faster.\r\n\r\nAnyway, [here is the example](https://gist.github.com/huttj/1d0e3473bbc9a12c2dbc). If you can take a look and let me know if it's expected that RethinkDB will take longer with multiple changefeeds that use unions, or if something else is going on, I would be grateful."
