      "@huttj -- In the example `goodUserQuery` and `badUserQuery` seem identical except for one using `map` and the other using `merge`, but your comment said that those were actually about the same speed.\r\n\r\nIf the problem is the `union`, could you explain more what the slowdown you're seeing is?  That the query `r.table('test').map(...)` is more than twice as fast as `r.table('test').map(...).union(r.table('test').map(...))`?\r\n\r\n`union` might sometimes make things a little bit slower, but if it's producing drastic slowdowns that sounds like a performance problem we should fix."
