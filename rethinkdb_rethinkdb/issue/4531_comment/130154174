      "Sorry for dropping this, slipped off my plate during the 2.1 release.\r\n\r\nI definitely see a slowdown when I open a bunch of changefeeds, but that's to be expected because it's drastically increasing network traffic.  I can't seem to reproduce the performance difference between unions of changefeeds and just the changefeeds themselves.\r\n\r\n@huttj -- sorry to punt this back to you, but do you think it would be possible to come up with a smaller, self-contained example?  There's a lot going on in the app you linked to which makes it harder to isolate your problem.\r\n\r\n(Also, you may want to look at resource usage on the machine running your RethinkDB server.  Is it possible that you're going into swap or saturating something?  That's the only thing I can think of off the top of my head that would result in a nonlinear slowdown if you have too many changefeeds open, and unions of changefeeds use slightly more resources on the server so it's theoretically possible they'd push you over the edge.)"
