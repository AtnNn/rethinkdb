      "@mlucy So is all squashing performed on the parsing node for the changefeed or does some of it happen on the individual shards?\r\n\r\nAssuming that it does work as @mlucy described over all shards, I don't feel strongly about whether we should have that state or not. Though I guess there is a chance for it to be misunderstood, so maybe we should leave it out of 2.1 and think about it more later (or maybe just leave it alone until someone asks for it)."
