      "The 'consistent' state really just means 'there are now no inconsistencies that were introduced by squashing' (i.e. that it's no worse than a nonsquashing changefeed).  That's currently an extremely weak guarantee (although it might theoretically get stronger if we improved the guarantees for nonsquashing changefeeds in the future, which we probably won't).  I would be OK with omitting it if people think it's confusing, though."
