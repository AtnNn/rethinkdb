      "I think you should use random uuids, and have a secondary index for timestamp. Until #364 is implemented, that's the best way to evenly distribute your data over the cluster, and get the best performance. If you try to shard by timestamp, all your writes will end up hammering one server, and rebalancing will be sort of equivalent to archiving older data. You won't get the benefits of sharding really."
