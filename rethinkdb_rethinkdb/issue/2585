        "I've been following RethinkDB for several months and finally got around to testing it with some data from a project I'm working on. To my surprise, inserts consistently take between 40-60s (min: 14ms for new doc, max 1m+ for 5MB doc) for documents larger than 3MB.\r\n\r\nMichael Lucy requested that I test this with another DB and open an issue if there was a major difference. MongoDB consistently takes between 200-300ms (min: 66ms with new doc, max: 1.2s with 4MB doc) to insert equivalent documents on the same hardware.\r\n\r\nServer:\r\nVirtualBox Ubuntu Server x64\r\nIntel i7 2.6GHz (full 8 \"cores\" granted to VM)\r\n7GB RAM\r\n20GB preallocated disk image backed by an SSD\r\n\r\nDriver:\r\nhttps://github.com/dancannon/gorethink\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n```go\r\nfunc saveGame(game *rdbs.Game) {\r\n\tresp, err := r.Table(\"games\").Insert(game).RunWrite(conn)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tfmt.Println(err)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tfmt.Printf(\"%+v\\n\", resp)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRethinkDB Versions:\r\nTested on both 1.12 and 1.13 (same results).\r\n\r\nRethinkDB Indexes:\r\nOnly primary key \"key\".
