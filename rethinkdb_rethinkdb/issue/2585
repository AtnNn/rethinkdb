        "I've been following RethinkDB for several months and finally got around to testing it with some data from a project I'm working on. To my surprise, inserts consistently take between 40-60s (min: 14ms for new doc, max 1m+ for 5MB doc) for documents larger than 3MB.\n\nMichael Lucy requested that I test this with another DB and open an issue if there was a major difference. MongoDB consistently takes between 200-300ms (min: 66ms with new doc, max: 1.2s with 4MB doc) to insert equivalent documents on the same hardware.\n\nServer:\nVirtualBox Ubuntu Server x64\nIntel i7 2.6GHz (full 8 \"cores\" granted to VM)\n7GB RAM\n20GB preallocated disk image backed by an SSD\n\nDriver:\nhttps://github.com/dancannon/gorethink\n\nCode:\n\n``` go\nfunc saveGame(game *rdbs.Game) {\n    resp, err := r.Table(\"games\").Insert(game).RunWrite(conn)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n    }\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"%+v\\n\", resp)\n}\n```\n\nRethinkDB Versions:\nTested on both 1.12 and 1.13 (same results).\n\nRethinkDB Indexes:\nOnly primary key \"key\". No secondary indexes.\n\nCharacteristic Document (~5MB):\nhttps://github.com/jjonescs/example-documents/blob/master/game.txt\n\nThanks,\nJosh\n"
