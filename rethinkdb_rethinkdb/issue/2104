        "While helping @morsik on irc this morning there was an interesting bug found. Pretty much running large number of writes for long period of time on single shard single table single server with 1gb cache the ram will slowly keep growing nothing super fast but will grow. My best guess is since the writes are coming in a little faster then the server can process them it would have to drop the write or keep it in ram and my guess its keeping them in memory \n\nRethinkdb 1.11.3 from offical rpm\nCentos 6.5\nKernel 2.6.32-431.5.1.el6.x86_64\nCores 8\nRam 6gb\nStorage: ZFS with write cache and compression\n"
