      "Ok, fix has been approved and merged to `next` in commit 7f2c8d4.  Will be in release 1.16.  Not merging this to `v1.15.x` because this is a significant change to a very important piece of code, and I'd like to give it some time before releasing it.  Plus, I don't think this issue is very common."
