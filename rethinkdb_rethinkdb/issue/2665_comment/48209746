      "The `lensum == res` assertion can only fail when `type == ACTION_READ`, and when `res != -1`.  `res` is the return value of a `preadv` call.\r\n\r\nPossibly: Can a short byte count happen if a readv or preadv system call, on a file, is interrupted after some progress has happened?\r\n\r\nAnother possibility: an EOF resulted in a short byte count, thanks to an ftruncate race condition in the kernel, or because of a race condition in the serializer with regard to truncation.\r\n\r\nAlso possible: we overwrite the iov_len fields, in-process, during the system call, from another thread, because of a memory corruption bug."
