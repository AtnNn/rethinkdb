      "@srh I'm pretty sure we have to handle the case where the return value is less than the sum of the length of the vectors as a partial (interrupted) success.  I remember running into a similar problem when experimenting with zero-copy networking, and it isn't too hard to advance the vectors and retry.\r\n\r\nDo you mind if I implement this and we can consider this fixed (given the lack of more information)?"
