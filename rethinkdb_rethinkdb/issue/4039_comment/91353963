      "...to answer my own question: I guess it's just bounded, but not fixed so fewer deletion entries could free up a little bit of space for other entries. I'm not sure if this actually has any effects, since once we start needing that space for new entries, we would probably expire those deletions (but maybe not in all cases? Not sure).\r\n\r\n@timmaxw that makes sense. I could see it leading to bugs, so we should fix it."
