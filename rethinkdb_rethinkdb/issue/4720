        "We've had some situations where enough servers were up, but the configuration didn't propagate properly and thus the cluster got stuck.\r\n\r\nOur current `emergency_repair` options only work if servers are actually disconnected. We should strongly consider adding some sort of `emergency_repair=\"force\"` mode. I'm not sure if this could actually be an option to `reconfigure`, and we have to think about how and whether it should actually change the configuration.\r\nEven if it just kept the current configuration, it could be useful if it forced a new epoch for the table configuration."
