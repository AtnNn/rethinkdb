      "`get_keys` could be confusing as well, since it doesn't get the keys but the documents under the keys.\r\nMaybe it's just me, but if I didn't know how the ReQL naming scheme works I could see myself thinking of `get_keys` as doing the same as `keys` (i.e. get the keys of an object).\r\nMaybe `fetch_keys` would be clearer? In that case we should probably also rename `get` to `fetch`?\r\n\r\nI'm generally not too fond of changing the name of `getAll` as a solution to this to be honest. But I could be convinced otherwise.\r\n\r\nI still prefer doing either the `r.args` special casing or generally allowing zero arguments to `get_all` without renaming the term."
