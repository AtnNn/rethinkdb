      "I'm not sure how clean or hacky this would be to implement on the server, but we could also suppress the error only if `r.args` is used as an argument to `getAll`.\r\n\r\nIf that's too tricky or breaks any significant abstractions in the server code, I think we should allow `get_all` with zero arguments.\r\nIf a user finds that there's a `getAll` term, they have probably found it through some type of documentation (either the Data Explorer auto suggestion, or our API docs). Chances are that they don't fully read the documentation, but once they notice that they always get an empty result from the term they will already know where to find the docs, at which point it will hopefully become obvious pretty quickly."
