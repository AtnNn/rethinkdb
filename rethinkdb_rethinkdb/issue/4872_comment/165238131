      "@snackycracky Oh so this is happening *every* time you join the other instances?\r\nSo far we've only seen this issue as a race condition if a server very quickly disconnects and immediately reconnects. I'm wondering if what you're seeing could be a different issue.\r\n\r\nDid you copy over the rethinkdb data folder between the Docker containers by any chance? That could theoretically explain some odd behavior like this. The way RethinkDB's metadata works requires that each server initially starts out with a new empty data directory. Otherwise there will be conflicts, as multiple servers will have the same server ID."
