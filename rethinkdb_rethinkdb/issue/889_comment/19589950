      "@coffeemug we don't want to merge `get` and `getAll` because they would return different type.\r\nI'm fine if methods return different types as long as it's predicable but you are not, and here you would be fine. That just doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of pluck right now is not, which means that if someone inserts a malformed document it can break my js/python/ruby code since I would catch error only around my query.\r\n\r\n\r\n@mlucy if we don't do polymorphism and keep the syntax you have proposed, we cannot use both syntax.\r\nIf we do polymorphism, having both syntax would be fine, but I don't think it's a good idea. It's just going to make the API more complex. I'm not strongly opposed to it though."
