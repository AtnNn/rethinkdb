      "For whatever it's worth, `pluck` is currently polymorphic on its first argument and I don't think anyone has complained about it.  We used to have both `pluck` and `pick` (or `pickattrs`, maybe), and people did find that confusing; they couldn't seem to remember which one to use on which type.  (This is a very vague memory because we moved to a polymorphic `pluck` nearly a year ago, so I might be wrong.)\r\n\r\nFrom the user's perspective, the goal is the same in either case: they have 1 or more objects (so either an object or a stream of objects) and they only want a subset of the attributes."
