      "Another thing we might want to consider is that since we're going to be using this syntax in a number of different places it might be a good idea to make it not be variadic since in many places like `group_by` and `group_map_reduce` this syntax is going to replace the first argument. It's really bad to have a variadic list of arguments at the start of your argument list. Especially because we could very easily want to use this syntax in a function that's variadic for other reasons at which point we would really be in a pickle. I think whichever proposal we go with we really need to consider how it can be written as a single argument. And might want to consider completely eliminating the variadic flavor so the syntax is unified everywhere. Although that has the serious downside that it breaks `pluck` compatibility which sucks."
