      "I would really like to hold this issue until we ship 1.7 and then extend the discussion. I think it's really important to get this one right, and the fact that @neumino has issues with what we came up with so far troubles me (it doesn't mean we shouldn't ever do it this way, but I think it's important enough to warrant additional discussion).\r\n\r\nWould anyone object if we \"sleep\" on this and then come back and discuss it some more?"
