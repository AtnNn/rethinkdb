      "There's a lot in your post, so I'll just address specific points in the interest of time:\r\n\r\n> we'd probably just have to turn off promiscuous truthiness here altogether which has a funny smell to me\r\n\r\nWe'd have to do this here and that doesn't have a bad smell at all, since this is a special syntax we're defining in the context of static value sugar. This seems ok.\r\n\r\n> We already have a pretty good syntax that allows you to do exactly this\r\n\r\nThat's true for `pluck`, but unfortunately we can't use that so easily for things like `without` and `groupBy`. I think we *need* a well defined way to refer to inner attributes across commands or the language will always feel clunky in this respect.\r\n\r\n> it really doesn't look that similar to underscore's pluck anymore\r\n\r\nIt's a superset of underscore's pluck. Under this proposal you can use it in exactly the same way as you would in underscore, unless you have to deal with nested attributes (which underscore doesn't support). Also, this is bigger than `pluck` (see above). Considering this, I don't see why `mask` is necessary, you can still say `pluck('a', 'b')` if you aren't dealing with nested objects."
