      "I first thought that plucking a nested array was not a valid case, but @coffeemug convinced me that it was.\r\n\r\nIn this case, I prefer @mlucy proposal. It's __way__ more easier to understand (and less confusing).\r\nI would still keep a simple syntax for first level fields (passing strings).\r\n\r\nLike @mglukhovsky said, the pain of writing `true` is less important than doing a mental transformation in each level.\r\n\r\nOne reason @mlucy proposal sounds better to me, is that I can define a schema (like in mongoose/juggling-db/etc), and pass it in my query with pluck.\r\n"
