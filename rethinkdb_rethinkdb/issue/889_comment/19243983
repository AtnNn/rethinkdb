      "I think I like the original proposal much more than JD's proposal. `{ :a => { :b => true }}` seems much more clear to me than `{ :a => b }`. The former is a bit longer, but it reads very intuitively (possibly because it maps directly to the object's structure?), where's the latter seems odd. @neumino, @mglukhovsky, what do you think?\r\n\r\n(Also, the original proposal seemed odd to me initially, but I really grew to like it after sleeping on it for a bit. It does what we need and is pretty intuitive, IMO. We'd be hard-pressed to do much better (not that we shouldn't try))"
