      "Another thing we could consider is just having `pluck` take just take paths represented by arrays:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# True syntax\r\nobj.pluck({:a => {:b => true, :c => true}})\r\n# JD syntax\r\nobj.pluck({:a => [:b, :c]})\r\n# Path syntax\r\nobj.pluck([:a, :b], [:a, :c])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe biggest con I can think of is that it could get unwieldy if you wanted to pluck a ton of things. But I think it's pretty impossible to misunderstand the syntax."
