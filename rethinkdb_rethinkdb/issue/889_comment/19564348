      "FYI, I am considering moving the nested object issues (this one and better `merge/update`) out of this release, since it's getting too big.\r\n\r\nI think this release should be about operations -- performance improvements, live backup, and a few reql changes (clean up things like gmr base, output of mutation commands, variadic `getAll`). I still have to talk to people about it, but we might have to delay this issue for a few weeks."
