      "So after thinking about this some more, I agree with @neumino. Having `pluck` (and `without`) be recursively polymorphic is a nice trick, but it's somewhat confusing, and more importantly unnecessary in the context of the extended static value sugar proposed here. So, while polymorphism on objects/sequences is awesome, I think we should take recursive polymorphism (e.g. array of arrays) out."
