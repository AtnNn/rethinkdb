      "I concur with @coffeemug.  We have a general rule that these things are polymorphic on streams and objects, and people don't seem to be confused out in the wild.  (Although, to be fair, being polymorphic *inside* the pluck is a little different from being polymorphic on the first argument, which I think people are more used to.)"
