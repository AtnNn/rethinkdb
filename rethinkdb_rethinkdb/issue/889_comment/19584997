      "Alright, so here's how I'm thinking about this:\r\n\r\n* We aren't so much defining a syntax for `pluck` as a syntax for specifying paths in objects.  As @coffeemug noted, we want people to be able to use this same path syntax for other terms.  So the question is more \"what's a good syntax for specifying subsets of objects\", not \"what's a good syntax for pluck\".\r\n* Both @mglukhovsky and @neumino thought the `=> true` syntax was easier to understand, which matches my intuitions as well, so I feel pretty strongly that we should support that syntax.\r\n* I don't feel as strongly about the question of whether or not to also accept the more concise syntax.\r\n  - Pro: If people have a statement like `.pluck(:a, :b, :c)`, it translates 1-1 to `.pluck({:nested => [:a, :b, :c]})`.\r\n  - Pro: Lets power-users use a shorter syntax if they're plucking a bajillion attributes.\r\n  - Con: Might be confusing when new users first see it.  I don't think this is actually a huge issue; if we use the intuitive syntax in our examples, the only place people will run into it will be if they read the in-depth documentation, ask us for help, or work on a project where someone else used that syntax.  In all three cases they either have the explanation of what it means in front of them or have someone to ask, so I don't think this is actually a huge problem.\r\n\r\nI'm currently leaning toward accepting both syntaxes, using the intuitive one in all our examples and short docs, and only mentioning the other one at the bottom of our in-depth docs (once we have them).  I could be convinced otherwise, though.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug, @neumino, @mglukhovsky -- what do you think about that idea?"
