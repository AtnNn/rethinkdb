      "I stand on the fact that polymorphism with nested objects is complicated and can lead to undesired behavior.\r\nAlso, like @mglukhovsky said earlier, the explicit syntax is just easier to use.\r\n\r\nI don't have any more arguments than what I said earlier, so I'll let you guys decide what to do, but I really believe that it's a bad decision."
