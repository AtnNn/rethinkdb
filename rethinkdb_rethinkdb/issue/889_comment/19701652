      "After thinking about it for a bit, I think it's a good thing that `s.pluck(...)` isn't equivalent to `s.map(r.row.pluck(...))`. This way users can call `s.pluck` and get the thing they want most of the time, but if they want polymorphism on one more level, they can call `s.map(r.row.pluck(...))`. It's kind of nice, actually."
