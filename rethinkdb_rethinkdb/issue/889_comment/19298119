      "It feels like if we support this shorthand syntax at the top level but not at the lower levels we'll still force people to be overly verbose if what they're plucking is a layer down (perhaps if they're plucking from the results of a `join` or a `group_by`.) These are starting to get less common but it if we support an object syntax and then a shortcut to that syntax in more common use cases to make it less verbose then why support the longer syntax at all? The example above doesn't seem to maintain the property that the selection structure mimics the output structure anymore."
