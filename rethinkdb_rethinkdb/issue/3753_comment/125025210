      "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31634640/rethinkdb-atomic-operations/31640295 would have benefited from this as well.\r\n\r\nI think the function we use here should be different from what we would use for `merge` (#873). In case of `insert`, the function shouldn't be called for individual fields, but on the whole document I think. The signature that @mlucy suggested here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3753#issuecomment-95019001 looks reasonable to me (that is `function (id, old_val, new_val)`)."
