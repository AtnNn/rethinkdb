      "@CsterKuroi If all tables are configured to have 60 replicas, you can take up to 29 nodes offline and the tables will still be available (after a short moment during which RethinkDB performs the automatic failover).\r\nThere is no need to restart any of the remaining nodes.\r\n\r\nNote that queries that are running at the moment where a node fails might get interrupted, and you'll have to restart changefeeds and some other queries once the auto-failover is complete."
