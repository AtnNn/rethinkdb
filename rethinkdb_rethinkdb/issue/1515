        "Right now `zip` is implemented in a way that does all of the work on the parsing node. For example the queries, `join.zip()` and `join.map(lambda x: x[\"left\"].merge(x[\"right\"]))` are an order of magnitude different in terms of performance despite being semantically identical.\r\n\r\nAlso this should be obvious but this isn't a corner case performance issue it's something that's going to affect anyone who does a join of any reasonable size and came up in @linuxdynasty's work.\r\n\r\nThe solution here is to just make `zip` a rewrite rule. That way it parallelizes automatically.\r\n\r\nAlso for bonus points on this issue I'd like to see the stuff in rdb_protocol/terms/rewrites.cc broken out in to separate files. It's weird to have terms organized in one file based on how they're implemented and in others based on what they do. This last part isn't required to close this issue it just would be nice."
