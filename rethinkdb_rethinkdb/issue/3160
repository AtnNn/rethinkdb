        "The current tests do some strange things combining the command-line admin as well as some internals in the http-admin in order to test administrative things like sharding. But these will largely be non-functional when the new ReQL admin commands land in `next`. So the testing infrastructure will need to be revamped for this.\n\n@timmaxw says that the branch for this is stable enough that I should begin this work.\n"
