      "I have a fix for this up for review with CR 1852. The solution looks first to the ENV variable `RUBY_DRIVER_DIR`, and then rolls back to using first the built driver, then the source driver if they look valid. Both of the latter are referenced via the path from the file rather than `pwd`. The `require` statements also use absolute paths, which should ensure that the desired version of the driver is used, with no possibility of getting the installed driver by accident.\r\n\r\nI also fixed a warning message about re-defining `ARGV`."
