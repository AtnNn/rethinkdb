        "The `interface.metadata_persistence` test is failing because the second server to use the data file is failing with a message telling us that the folder is in use. The problem turns out to be that `kill_process_group` from `test/common/utils.py` is not correctly detecting when the process ends, so we are returning too soon.\n\nI have a fix for this already, and this is just for tracking.\n"
