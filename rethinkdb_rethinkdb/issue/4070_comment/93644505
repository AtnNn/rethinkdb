      "@hsen-dev -- if you compress your data in the client, you can use `r.binary` to store arbitrary binary blobs on the server (and then uncompress them again in the client).\r\n\r\nAs for adding compression to the database, there's an issue for this at https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1396 (closing this one as a duplicate).  We've looked at a few compression algorithms so far including snappy (you can find more details on how they performed in that issue).\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion!"
