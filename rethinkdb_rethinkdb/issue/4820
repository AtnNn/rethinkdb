        "# 4620 is being implemented as a workaround to #544. Long term it probably makes more sense for the server to keep track of and uniquely identify connected clients with a `client_id`.\n\nHaving client info exposed on the `Connection` object (as I've done in #4796) works for now, but turns out to be difficult to work with, especially when you're doing connection pooling. It would be much easier if there were a ReQL term that allowed you to access this info as part of your query. For example:\n\n``` js\nr.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').filter({ client_id: r.client('id') })\n```\n"
