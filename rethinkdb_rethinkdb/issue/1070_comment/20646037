      "Ok, I have a fix for this, which is for rethinkdb porcelain to remove the data directory if it fails between creating the data directory and actually populating it.  I have some concerns about this, though, in the case of a user running two rethinkdb instances on the data directory at the same time.  There are a ton of outcomes I can imagine, all of them racy, and I'm not sure if that's really what we want.\r\n\r\nWould it possibly be better to, instead of using cooperative locking on our metadata files, just use cooperative locking on the data directory itself?  Does that even work?  If we could ensure that, then this fix would be fine."
