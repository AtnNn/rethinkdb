      "@chipotle, makes sense. The best way to find out if it's the right thing to say is to ask folks here or on Slack (I've found a quick \"does this make sense?\" works wonders).\r\n\r\nAlso, as a general note, I actually disagree that release notes are most likely to be read from the terminal. The only users who read release notes from the terminal are those who download the source distribution and compile locally -- otherwise, GitHub Releases is probably the number one way people read the notes. That's not an argument to change what you've done, just a general comment on our audience (I could be incorrect, but I suspect this to be true)."
