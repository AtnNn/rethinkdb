When dowgrading, you can follow the [migration instructions in this article](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/migration/).\r\n\r\nIn your case you may need to adapt those instructions a little:\r\n\r\n* Reinstall RethinkDB 1.15.2 and start the server\r\n* You may need to install a matching version of the Python driver\r\n* Extract your data with `rethinkdb dump` as explained in the article\r\n* Stop the RethinkDB server\r\n* Backup and delete the data directory\r\n* Downgrade to RethinkDB 1.13.4 and start the server\r\n* You may need to downgrade the Python driver as well\r\n* Import your data using `rethinkdb restore` as explained in the article\r\n"
