      "Making updates conditional on a timestamp might actually become feasible after https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2134 .\r\nWe can also consider exposing that as a separate feature where an update is only applied if a given document hasn't been modified since some previous read. I think I had once discussed this with @wojons, but I can't find a separate issue about it feature at the moment.\r\n\r\nThat's at least two releases away I think."
