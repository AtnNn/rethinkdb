        "In issue #2399 a table became inaccessible because a `r.literal()` pseudo-type made it to disk. When reading the value back, an exception was thrown and the deserialization of the datum_t failed.\r\n\r\nWe should add a verification to `datum_t`'s serialization code to make sure that illegal pseudotypes are not written to disk.\r\nWhat makes this slightly more complicated is that the question of whether a given `r.literal` is legal or not depends on the context of the serialization. It is never legal to write one to disk, while it is sometimes legal to serialize it for a network message."
