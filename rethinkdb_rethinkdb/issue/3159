        "Encryption and authentication for accessing the web UI would be neat to have at some point.\r\n\r\n@VeXocide suggested that we could replace our internal HTTP server by an external library that comes with HTTPS support built in, specifically libevent+libevhtp (https://github.com/ellzey/libevhtp).\r\nI'm not sure how that would interact with our custom coroutine runtime and networking stack, though I imagine we could launch the HTTP server through an extproc worker.\r\n\r\nMy impression is that this is a bit less important for users than #3158 and #3151, though I could be wrong.\r\n\r\n(This issue is a superset of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1163, which I'm going to close now)"
