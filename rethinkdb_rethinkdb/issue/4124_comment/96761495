      "@stuartpb \r\nYou can use `r.js` as a work-around for most cases except for secondary index functions (because we cannot guarantee it's deterministic):\r\n`table.orderBy(r.js(\"(function(x) { return Math.log(x.field); })\"))`\r\n\r\nI think we'll add more math functions to ReQL in the long term, though for these more complex operations we'll first need to figure out https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3009 before we can allow using them in a secondary index."
