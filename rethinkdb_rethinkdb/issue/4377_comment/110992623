      "Well, I've only just recently started using checkinstall.  I have used it with about 10 other software packages I've compiled and installed and never ran into this issue. I can't really vouch for it in combination with 'install -d' though.\r\n\r\nI can't say for sure and I'd rather not try to uninstall and re-install to test right now."
