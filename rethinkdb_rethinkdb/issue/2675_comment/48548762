      "Is this for the query parallelization?  If so, doing the deduping on the shards efficiently in parallel isn't a one-line fix -- we'd have to do several dedpups in parallel, then do a mergesort-type thing to produce a final list without duplicates from the sub-lists.  Alternatively, we could just not parallelize `distinct`."
