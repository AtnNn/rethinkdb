        "Currently data explorer results presentation has a couple of issues:\n1. The arrows for nested objects have strange indentation which makes results confusing to read.\n2. Column size is usually very compact and often cuts off text which can be rather frustrating. We should try to have a smarter algorithm for column size.\n3. There is a lot of unnecessarily wasted space between the query and the results which can be easily removed without any downside.\n4. If we readjust the width of the columns in the table view and reexecute the query, the adjustments aren't remembered.\n"
