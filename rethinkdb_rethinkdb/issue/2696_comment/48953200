      "Fair enough, so my point about being consistent with the docs is moot. However the question remains whether a range starting with the an index that's behind the array should be valid or not.\r\n\r\nAlso, just to clarify: You are not suggesting that `r.expr([1,2,3,4,5]).deleteAt(10, 10)` should be valid as well, are you?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother option for maintaining compatiblity would be some \"compatiblity\" field in the environment. Terms could behave slightly differently based on the value of that field. We would probably not expose access to that field for regular ReQL queries, but could set it for secondary index function evaluation."
