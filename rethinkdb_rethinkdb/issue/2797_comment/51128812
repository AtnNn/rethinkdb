      "Whatever solution we select, I would like to state that it would be very useful if the client can get some representation of the sindex function that can be saved and used later with `index_create`, I don't care if it's opaque.  Currently export/import has the shortcoming that secondary indexes are lost, and if we're going to implement this fix, I'd like the solution to allow us to fix this behavior.  Even better if we can warn about behavioral differences like @srh proposes."
