      "OK, let's go with option 6 and the optarg name `function` (unless someone has a better one).  `function` will return a `binary` type, and `index_create` will (when passed binary data) interpret that data as a field retrieved from `index_status`.  The binary blob should contain both the cluster version and the function.\r\n\r\nAnyone object to that?"
