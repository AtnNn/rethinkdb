      "I'm OK with option 6, and I agree that `code` is a bad field name. Maybe `function` instead? `opaque_function`?\r\n\r\nHowever, I think Sam has a good point that once we expose a sindex function representation to the user, we have to worry about backwards compatibility. So this might actually be an advantage of option 2. Or, maybe the version flag Sam suggested is good enough to solve the problem."
