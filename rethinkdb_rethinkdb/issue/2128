        "Right now, when we release a block that we've written, a snapshot of the block is stored in the page_txn_t.  If another operation goes to modify the block, it'll have to copy the memory.  We could instead _not_ snapshot the block, and make the next transaction that modifies the page a \"preceder\" (in the page_txn_t lingo) of the previous transaction that modified the page.  Or, maybe we should only do this when the next transaction estimates it will only write a small number of pages, or when the previous transaction is in soft durability mode (lest the previous transaction have its to-disk latency slowed by a very large transaction that follows it).\n\nWe should not do this change without profiling reporting high CPU usage in the copy-on-write page copying that currently is believed to happen.\n"
