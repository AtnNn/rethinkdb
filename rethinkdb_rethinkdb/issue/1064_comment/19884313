      "So, I named this issue incredibly poorly, but I'm also concerned about the fact that he mentioned the queries being **interrupted**, which I don't think should happen here:\r\n```\r\nThis runs for about 9 minutes, and then dies with this error:\r\n\r\n     RqlRuntimeError: Query interrupted.  Did you shut down the server? in:\r\n     [query]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI didn't realize that this was probably an out-of-memory workload; that lessens my performance concerns."
