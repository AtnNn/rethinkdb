      "From Drew's mails: \"The on-disk size is about 9GB\"\r\n\r\nAnd further: \"Finally, let's check in with the last suspect: the disk.  Since my disk is fairly constantly pegged at 9MB/sec reads during this query. [...] What seems to be happening here is 131k preads to the single datafile [...] Oddly enough, around 2 minutes in, the size of the pread seems to drop to 4096 bytes\"\r\n\r\nThe drop of the read size after 2 minutes clearly indicates that the cache has filled up and RethinkDB disabled the read-ahead function used to fill up the cache after a cold start. From there on, essentially every single access to a document meant random disk reads."
