      "To add to Joe's comment, the reason I originally put this into 1.7.x is that this is a pretty major issues for OS X users on a live version (1.7), so if we could have fixed it as a point release, it would have been worth it.\r\n\r\nSince it looks like we won't be doing point releases until 1.8 is out (I saw comments to this effect on a couple of other issues), we can move it to 1.8 if it can get done by then, otherwise we'll move it to 1.8.x once 1.8 is out."
