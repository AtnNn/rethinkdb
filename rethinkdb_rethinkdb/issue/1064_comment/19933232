      "As far as performance goes, here's what I think happens FYI. We peg the cache size for the table to 1GB. We populate the cache quickly using read-ahead. Once we hit 1GB, we turn off read ahead and read 4kb chunks. This would explain Drew's disk read profile.\r\n\r\n@mlucy -- you said this workload happens much more quickly on newton -- can you confirm this? Also, who's the best person to look into the interruption issue?"
