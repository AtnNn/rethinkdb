      "I'm going to do some investigation here into the question of whether we're looping in situations where we really should be doing a pmap (for example, in loading values out of a leaf node).  Also, I was told by @jdoliner that when evaluating `count()`, we shouldn't actually load the blob into memory.  I'll check if that's true.  "
