      "Hi @eliaslevy , this is related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3462 .\r\n\r\nIf you only get a few documents from the `getAll`, you can work around it by appending `.distinct()` after the `getAll`.\r\n\r\nI feel like we had discussed this at some point, but I don't remember what the conclusion was.\r\n@mlucy do you remember any discussion on this?\r\n\r\nIt seems like removing duplicates where a single document is indexed under the same key multiple times could be done efficiently by doing an ordered index traversal.\r\nIt might be inconsistent with the behavior we get for the case where a document is indexed under multiple *different* keys, since we would still get duplicates in that case. So I'm not sure if it would be less confusing or more confusing to filter same-key duplicates."
