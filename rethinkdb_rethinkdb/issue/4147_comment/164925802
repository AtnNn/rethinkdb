      "@thomasmodeneis If you look at one of the documents that's duplicated in your queries, does it have the same multi index key multiple times? (e.g. `[\"a\", \"b\", \"a\"]` where `\"a\"` occurs twice)\r\nOr are you passing multiple arguments into `getAll(key1, key2, ...)` and the same document matches multiple different keys?\r\n\r\nThe former could be avoided more easily at insert/update time, by including the `.distinct()` into the insert query (I can give you some more details and an example if this is actually what's happening)."
