      "> If we're OK doing work proportional to the size of the array, we can skip the first bullet point and just recompute the sorted array when we load the row off of disk. For most multi-indexes (i.e. ones without thousands of entries) that should be plenty fast.\r\n\r\nI think for many queries we do that anyway, and we used to do it always until recently. I think that would be ok, and would avoid a lot of extra work.\r\n\r\nYour proposal sounds good and reasonably easy to implement. I like it."
