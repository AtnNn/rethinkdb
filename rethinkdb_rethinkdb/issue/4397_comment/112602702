      "@danielmewes I actually do not quite understand why the whole table would have to be re-written when extending the key/value space. Don't you just use the newly created indexes in the table afterwards? The \"old\" part of the table can stay the same -- I would assume.\r\n\r\nFor example, with a table of three rows, I would map indexes 1 to the key \"movie-title\", 2 to \"genre\", 3 to \"description\". If I extend the table to six rows, rows 1-3 are untouched and I can add: 4 as \"popcorn-sold\", 5 as \"sodas-sold\", 6 as \"something-else\".\r\n"
