      "I'm not super fond of a solution where you have to recreate the whole table once you run out of key value space. That sounds like something that you can shoot yourself in the foot with quite easily.\r\n\r\nActually I think having to specify the set of keys manually at table creation would be a better solution. It would a) be easier, b) make the limitation explicit instead of having some magic that works for a while, but might stop working once the key cache is full, c) avoids the question of how to synchronize the key caches across servers"
