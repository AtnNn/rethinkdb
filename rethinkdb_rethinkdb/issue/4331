        "With the new raft code making failovers automatic it is now more likely that an availability problem like a primary going down will correct itself quickly. So rather than sending back an availability error immediately we could retry it one or more times automatically to see if the problem clears itself up. Ultimately there needs to be a timeout, and it would be nice if the user had an option to set this.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to add this as an opt-arg to `run`, for example `retry_timeout`. It would have a default value (e.g. 2 seconds), and a value of 0 would cause it to work as it does now. It might also make sense to allow `Connection` objects to have a value for this, as well as the default connection object used through `repl`. "
