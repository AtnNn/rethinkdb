      "This looks like a problem in how we try to get all locally bound addresses on the same port when we allow the OS to assign a port.  I'll need to investigate more (later), but it may be that Arch assigns ports non-randomly - we retry a few times to get all the listening sockets on the same local port.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, @anatol, is this consistently repeatable?"
