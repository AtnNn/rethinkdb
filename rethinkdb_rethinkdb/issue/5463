        "Discussed this with @VeXocide and this is what we came up with:\r\n\r\n* Read permissions on system tables will be assigned through the usual mechanism (i.e. the \"rethinkdb\" database is treated like any other database)\r\n* Nobody can write to a system table, except for the `admin` user who can write to all system tables\r\n* One exception from the rule: Users can update their own document in the `users` table, as long as they have read and write permissions on the `users` table as granted through the usual mechanism.\r\n\r\nNote that operations such as `r.table(...).config().update(...)` or `r.table(...).reconfigure(...)` can still be performed by non-admin users, if the user has `config` permissions on the affected table."
