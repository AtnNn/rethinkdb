      "I think we should do what Joe says, though, for the time being.  Making the B-tree support large value keys would require touching a lot of code, introduce bugs via merge conflicts, might hurt typical-case performance, and probably has other difficulties we haven't thought of.  Filtering key/value pairs would require touching just one part of the code, and for its performance problems, the user could program their way around it.  There is a higher chance of us messing up the implementation of something, though."
