      "It seems that if we can easily (development-wise) extend key sizes to arbitrary lengths, we should do that. We'd still limit the user-facing key size to 250 characters, but will avoid the annoying secondary-index-too-long problem (along with dealing with false positives). The performance issue seems orthogonal to me (even if we simply capped the primary key size to something lower than 250 chars, we'd have to deal with large common prefixes and the performance hit of filtering out false positives)."
