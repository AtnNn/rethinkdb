      "I brought the database size up to 127 GB. The rethinkdb dump takes extremely long on the rotational drive I'm running this on, but it does go through and does not consume excessive amounts of memory either.\r\n\r\nAs I could not reproduce the issue, I don't think there is more we can do right now. If it occurs again with more recent versions of the server we will investigate further.\r\n\r\nI'm going to open a follow-up issue about the high memory consumption when resuming write queries after dumping the DB."
