      "This is actually fixable (but not easily). When the user does an unordered scan, we can be much smarter about scheduling reads in a way that's aware of disk layout on rotational drives. Unfortunately this crosses some abstraction boundaries, so making a fix for this would be very non-trivial. I've opened a separate issue for it (#1552 in backlog), but this won't happen for quite some time."
