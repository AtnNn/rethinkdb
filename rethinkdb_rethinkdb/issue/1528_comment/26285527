      "I've tried this with a database of 54 GB (on disk size) on a 6 GB machine, and it went fine. This was on the current code base (branch next) with the fix to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1538 applied.\r\n\r\nI will try to increase the database size further to something closer to 160 GB, but it seems like the issue might have been fixed in the meantime."
