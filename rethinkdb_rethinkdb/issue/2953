        "I'm in the process of using `r.changes()` to implement some important functionality in my app. My problem is that I'm seeing a single point of failure here. If the process that's reading a changefeed fails and disconnects from Rethink, further changes will be discarded until the process comes back up (it is my understanding the Rethink only buffers changes internally while a process is connected and tailing that buffer).\r\n\r\nAre there plans to address this issue in the design of changefeeds? Am I looking at something incorrectly?\r\n\r\nThank you."
