We should continue the discussion there, but note a couple of things:\r\n\r\n- according to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2699#issuecomment-49071302 (and the Wikipedia article) JSON does support null characters in strings\r\n- see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2699#issuecomment-49069810 (the behavior of throwing on null characters is extremely inconvenient to users; we should find a way around that if we can)"
