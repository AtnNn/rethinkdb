        "If you do a `count()` on a whole table or on an indexed range (through `between()`), we could implement the following optimization to boost `count()`s CPU efficiency by some factor:\r\nOnce we get to a leaf node that's completely in the range being counted, we could just read the \"number of keys\" entry in the leaf node and move on. Currently we iterate over all key/value pairs, just to increment a counter for each.\r\n\r\nWhether this makes sense to do or not probably depends on how much work it would be."
