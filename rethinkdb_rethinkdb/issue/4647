        "I went from running rethinkdb on the command line to starting it as a service. I used the default conf except for changing the data and log locations. This crash happened after trying to (re)start the service.\n\nThe problem ended up being the log config change. I commented it back out to let rethinkdb use its default and then it started up just fine.\n\nProbably an issue with permissions but @mglukhovsky asked me log the crash here.\n\n```\ncat /proc/version\nLinux version 3.13.0-48-generic (buildd@orlo) (gcc version 4.8.2 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1) ) #80-Ubuntu SMP Thu Mar 12 11:16:15 UTC 2015\n```\n\n```\nrethinkdb -v\nrethinkdb 2.0.4~0trusty (GCC 4.8.2)\n```\n\n```\nsudo /etc/init.d/rethinkdb start\nrethinkdb: instance1: The instance is not running (there is no pid file)\nrethinkdb: instance1: will only listen on local network interfaces.\nrethinkdb: instance1: To expose rethinkdb on the network, add the 'bind=all' option to /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d/instance1.conf\nrethinkdb: instance1: Starting instance.
