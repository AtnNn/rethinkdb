        "If I run a cluster with three nodes on a certain data set (the one from #2988), I get a CPU consumption of about 5-7 % of one core per rethinkdb process. This happens without any load. I don't have a browser pointing to the web UI. There is no i/o activity. \n\nComparing `ajax/stat` at two different times shows that there is no garbage collection or other apparent background task going on. However the event loop keeps processing events.\n\nThis is probably one for @Tryneus or @VeXocide.\n\nTo reproduce (on newton or electro):\n- Build RethinkDB from 1.15.x (DEBUG=0)\n- Go into `build/release`\n- Run `for i in 1 2 3; do tar -xzvf /home/daniel/user-data/2988-data/socialradar-rethinkdb-$i-stopped.tar.gz; mv srv srv$i; done` to unpack the data\n- Start instances as follows:\n  `./rethinkdb -o 0 -j localhost:29015 -d srv1/rethinkdb/userdb/data/ --cache-size 128 --bind all &`\n  `./rethinkdb -o 1 -j localhost:29015 -d srv2/rethinkdb/userdb/data/ --cache-size 128 --bind all &`\n  `./rethinkdb -o 2 -j localhost:29015 -d srv3/rethinkdb/userdb/data/ --cache-size 128 --bind all &`\n- Wait until RethinkDB is done loading the LBAs etc. (that is until all tables become available)\n- You should see a CPU consumption in htop of 5-7% per instance\n"
