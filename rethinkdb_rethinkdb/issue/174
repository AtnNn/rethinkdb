        "Currently when we show the number of documents in the web ui we say \"~X documents\" where X can be any number. This confuses people because they think counts are wrong. We should change wording to say \"About X documents\" where X shouldn't have precision in significant digits. E.g. \"About 300 documents\" is better than \"~305 documents\".\r\n\r\nWe should also do the same when we report number of documents per shard.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure how to trim precision yet."
