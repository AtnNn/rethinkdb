      "Also if we are going to do the localized version, some library like ICU is necessary.  Locale handling is madness, a rabbit hole of staggering, Alice-like proportions, and we should in no way ever even attempt to do it ourselves.  I've mentioned privately `boost::locale` which is a shell around ICU if the right configuration options are set; we could explore that.\r\n\r\nOf course once the nose of ICU is in the tent, we could do collation with it.  That could actually be a large issue, as presumably we want to be able to have a secondary index that is in collation order, which could involve a lot of code.  This is unlikely to be a problem with capitalization, though."
