      "UTF-8 is a well designed format, and the bit pattern that encodes ASCII code points does not ever appear in a multi-byte context; all multibyte sequences (representing non-ASCII code points) have the most significant bit set.  So in that sense our present version will work with UTF-8 seamlessly.  It will not work with various things that people might think were obvious, like \233 to \201 or \223 to SS, but that's completely incoherent absent a locale.\r\n\r\nI personally prefer doing things properly, but as you mention and as I have been at pains to point out, this requires localization.  It may be easier to add new functions than to reuse `tolower` / `toupper` that accept the locale.\r\n\r\nEdit: correct terminology slightly; I'm trying to be more careful about character vs. code point but my fingers aren't reprogrammed yet."
