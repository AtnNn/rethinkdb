        "When we \"build\" the YAML tests (polyglot) we translate a number of things (such as dicts) to the target language when we can to save the need of typing the same test multiple times where not necessary. Currently we translate all lines, including language-specific lines (e.g.: `js`, `py`, `rb`). Instead I want to translate only `cd` and `ot` lines.\n\nThis is going to probably cause a number of problems (especially in translating snake-case to camel-case), but is worth doing since there are cases where this means we are not able to do some testing such as in `polyglot/datum/object.js` (search of this bug number).\n"
