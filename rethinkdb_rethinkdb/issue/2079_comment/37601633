      "I feel like one possible way in which this assertion could be wrong is this:\r\nSuppose the page is modified, then deleted, then resurrected as a new page with the same block id.\r\nIn general if a new page is allocated, it can have any recency. The assertion on the other hand asserts that recencies only ever increase. This is a good thing to assert, but not if the page had been deleted in between.\r\nIt seems that the `change.page == NULL` in the assertion is meant to account for pages that have been deleted and then re-used. However that doesn't work, because the deletion might be happening in a different transaction that hasn't yet been processed by `compute_changes()` yet."
