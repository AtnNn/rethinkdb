      "It looks like this is doable, but there are a couple of details that are going to be work:\r\n\r\n* `coverage.py` uses a c extension to Python, so would require some compilation\r\n* coverage is in multiple tests (YAML + connections), so we would need to create coverage files for each, and then collect them together (using the API).\r\n\r\nThis is still likely to be put off for a while, but is worth doing."
