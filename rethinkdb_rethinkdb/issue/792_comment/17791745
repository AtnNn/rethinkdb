      "Ok I found the solution.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.kill.html says default 'KillMode' is cgroup. I believe it kills all process in cgroup at once. It seems rethinkdb does not like when children die before master process, so it does not remove pid file. Is it expected?\r\n\r\nChanging it to 'KillMode=process' fixes the issue. I'll keep it open for a while to make sure that it works fine."
