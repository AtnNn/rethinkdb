      "I haven't looked into Mosquitto yet, so I'm not sure about the details of this.\r\nWhich role exactly would Mosquitto play in this scenario? Would its main purpose be to provide an access point to the browser? You also mention having it handle real-time feeds. Is that for efficiency / simplicity or is there something you think it does better than RethinkDB changefeeds?\r\n\r\nWe're working on some ideas to move things closer to the browser. You might be interested in taking a look at https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3711 , which is what we're currently looking into."
