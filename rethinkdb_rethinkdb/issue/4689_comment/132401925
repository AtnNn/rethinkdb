      "Thanks for clarifying.\r\n\r\nAs part of #3711, we're considering adding a plugin infrastructure to RethinkDB. Different integrations can live in plugins that you can launch together with the RethinkDB server (we're going to put up a comprehensive proposal soon). I think that would be a great place for integrating with an MQTT server as well, and we could also put the HTTP endpoint in there. We'll see how these ideas work out with GraphQL. Once we have the infrastructure for that, I think this might be a relatively simple extension on a technical level."
