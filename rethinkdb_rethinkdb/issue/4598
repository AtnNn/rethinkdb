        "Feature request or an idea that could be a feature at some point. I would love to have them for those cases when you absolutely need them. Like ecommerce applications or similar use cases. \n\nMy understanding from the discussions I have had with @danielmewes is, that transaction in general could be slow and not trivial to implement. I personally would love to have them even if it would mean, that they are indeed slow. Kind of like majority reads. I think there is more value in having slow transactions than not having them at all. I cant say if implementing them is actually worth the trouble, but my thinking is, that transactions could be one of those big features people coming from SQL world expect to have. \n\nI wrote this because \"felixis\" came to #rethinkdb and asked about them and @AtnNn pointed out, that he wasn't able to find feature request for them.\n"
