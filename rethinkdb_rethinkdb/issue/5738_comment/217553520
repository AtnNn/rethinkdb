      "I don't think closing the cursor twice would cause an error with the `Feed._next` method in the backtrace. My best guess is still that the cursor or connection is closed somewhere while it's still in use.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't turn out to be the case, we'll need to investigate this further on the driver side."
