      "Thanks for the thorough response. I've confirmed that I only encounter the problem upon upgrading to Rethink 2.3.0 -- node 6 doesn't appear to be the culprit. I've changed the title of the issue appropriately.\r\n\r\nThe server is a relatively straightforward JSON REST API server, with the nice added feature of being able to listen for changes over a websocket. I've excerpted the relevant methods in a Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/iameli/971117560d5a5bc59e342675a936849b).\r\n\r\nThe only method called on a cursor in the REST bits is `.toArray()`, I can't really imagine what the issue would be there. The only other code that uses Rethink is in that (somewhat messy) `watch` function.\r\n\r\nNow that I'm glancing at it, it kind of looks like I might be closing the changefeed twice? I wonder if that's related."
