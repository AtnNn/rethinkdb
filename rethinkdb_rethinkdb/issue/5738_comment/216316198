      "Thanks for the issue report @iameli . Do you remember from which RethinkDB driver version you upgraded?\r\n\r\n@iameli Which API functions are you using in your application for iterating over cursors? `each`, `eachAsync`, `eventEmitter`s?\r\n\r\nIn the 2.3.0 driver, we changed the behavior of cursors a little bit. Reading from a cursor now always generates an error if either the cursor or the underlying RethinkDB connection have previously been closed. In the old version, reading from a cursor after closing the connection (or cursor) would sometimes still work, and only fail if the cursor needed to retrieve additional results.\r\nThe new behavior is more consistent, but if your application (unintentionally?) relied on the old behavior, this change could explain the failures you are now seeing."
