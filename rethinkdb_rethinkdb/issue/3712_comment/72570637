      "Hi @marchon. Sorry you ran into this, and thank you for your detailed report. Could you provide us some more information to help diagnose this problem?\r\n\r\n* Can you upload your RethinkDB log file? If you run RethinkDB from the command line, the log file will be located by default in the `rethinkdb_data` directory.\r\n\r\n* After reproducing the problem, can you run the query `r.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"stats\")` and upload the result?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
