      "@marchon I think the memory issue might have to do with the secondary index construction that was going on at the same time as the inserts.\r\n\r\nIf you want to give it another shot, I recommend one of these work-arounds:\r\n- Create all indexes first, wait until they are ready, then start inserting data\r\n- First insert all data, then create the indexes\r\n\r\nWe're working on rewriting how secondary indexes are constructed (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2134) because of issues like this, but the new implementation will likely take a few months before it's ready and sufficiently tested for shipping.\r\n\r\nAnother problem with the current index construction implementation is that it can sometimes slow other queries down significantly (e.g. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1955). This is also going to be solved with #2134, but still exists as of now."
