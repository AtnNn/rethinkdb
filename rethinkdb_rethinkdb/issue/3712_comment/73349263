      "Found the problem.\r\nWe are moving something into a `boost::optional`. However we later rely on the value still being there in its original place. So using the move here is a bug.\r\nIt seems that older versions of Boost didn't support/use the move constructor for `boost::optional`, and newer versions do. So the bug was hidden in older versions of Boost.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the move, we were never evicting pages from the cache, thereby filling up the memory.\r\n\r\nGoing to put a fix up soon, so we can roll out a point release next week."
