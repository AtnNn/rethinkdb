I am glad that\nwe have brought some light to the subject, and I think your responsiveness\nis impressive.\n\nYou might get me to switch back yet - if you have time for a quick google\nhangout - we can chat about it.  and you can tell me if your solution fits\nmy needs.\n\n\nG.\n\nOn Thu, Feb 5, 2015 at 2:54 AM, Daniel Mewes <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> @marchon <https://github.com/marchon> Yeah I doubt it's that easy.
