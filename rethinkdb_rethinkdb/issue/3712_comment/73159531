      "The Valgrind-reported leak was probably a red herring. We traced it down to what looks like a Clang bug in at least Clang 3.2. We don't know yet whether this specific bug even affects the OS X build, since we're using a more recent version there.\r\n\r\nIn any case after working around the leak that Valgrind reported the memory consumption is still way higher with Boost 1.56.0 than with 1.55.0, both on Linux and on OS X. Valgrind doesn't report any leaks, so we're mostly back to square one."
