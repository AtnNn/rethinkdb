      "@marchon Yeah I doubt it's that easy. We use boost::variant all over the place, but only this one is causing an issue.\r\n\r\nI did a git bisect between v1.15.x and v1.16.x and it seems that this commit introduced the memory leak that Valgrind reports:\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/commit/890814f2ae74ac3df03209cb671fe16169460aee#diff-cc9504334637dde0a679d9cbf47c3683R345\r\n\r\nThe parent https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/commit/0f2b17a73b34f4914a8d4c45761026eeca26ec73 was still good.\r\n\r\nAlso pinging @mlucy."
