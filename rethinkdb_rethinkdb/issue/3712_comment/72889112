      "I offered this help in the interest of advancing your project which looks\nlike it has promise.\n\nThese changes are not going to have a direct positive result for me, as I\nneeded an immediate solution and thought that I should consider your\nsolution as an alternative to mongodb.\n\nThank you for keeping me up to date and good luck with your project.\n\nG.\n\nOn Tue, Feb 3, 2015 at 5:37 PM, Daniel Mewes <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> @marchon <https://github.com/marchon> I think the memory issue might have\n> to do with the secondary index construction that was going on at the same\n> time as the inserts.\n>\n> If you want to give it another shot, I recommend one of these work-arounds:\n>\n>    - Create all indexes first, wait until they are ready, then start\n>    inserting data\n>    - First insert all data, then create the indexes\n>\n> We're working on rewriting how secondary indexes are constructed (see\n> #2134 <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2134>) because of\n> issues like this, but the new implementation will likely take a few months\n> before it's ready and sufficiently tested for shipping.\n>\n> Another problem with the current index construction implementation is that\n> it can sometimes slow other queries down significantly (e.g. #1955\n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1955>). This is also going\n> to be solved with #2134\n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2134>, but still exists as\n> of now.\n>\n> \8212\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3712#issuecomment-72750897>\n> .\n>\n\n\n\n-- \nP THINK BEFORE PRINTING: is it really necessary?\n\nThis e-mail and its attachments are confidential and solely for the\nintended addressee(s).
