        "Hi there!\n\nI have a use case where I need a multi index that's a combination of two properties. It's probably easiest to show a broken example:\n\nUltimately, what I'd like to be able to do is get the record below with either of these queries:\n\n``` js\nr.db('test').table('documents').getAll([1, \"red\"], {index: 'customer_tags'});\nr.db('test').table('documents').getAll([1, \"blue\"], {index: 'customer_tags'});\n```\n\n**The data:**\n\n``` json\n {\n   \"id\": \"d5a17ff0-1108-4214-b762-c0dbd6aa4f26\",\n   \"customer_id\": 1,\n   \"tags\": [\n      \"red\",\n      \"blue\"\n    ]\n }\n```\n\n**How I would write the index, if it were possible to use `r.row` here:**\n\n``` js\nr.db('test').table('documents').indexCreate('customer_tags', r.row('tags').map(function(tag){\n  return [r.row('customer_id'), tag];\n}), {multi: true})\n```\n\nIs there currently a way to do this that I'm just missing? This seems like it's probably a pretty common use case.\n\nThanks so much!\nMike\n"
