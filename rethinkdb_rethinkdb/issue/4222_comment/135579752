      "Actually it might be better to only support 4 byte tags in indexes with the right (new) reql version.\r\nImagine you delete a document from a table with an existing index. Currently we compute all the sindex keys based on the value of the document you delete. Then we look up those exact keys in the secondary index tree, and delete them. If we could have both 1 byte and 4 bytes tags in a secondary index, this wouldn't work anymore since we wouldn't know whether the given document had been indexed using the short or the long tags."
