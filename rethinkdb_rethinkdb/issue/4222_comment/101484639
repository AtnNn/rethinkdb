      "@danielmewes -- I was reading about mongo text indexes, and as far as I can tell they just do this and people are OK with the significant performance consequences (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/index-text/).\r\n\r\nI don't think that's the biggest problem, though; I think even if you're using multi-key indexes for other things it's easy to hit this limit in production (restaurants can have more than 256 locations, etc. etc.).  This is a pretty easy fix aside from the migration issue, I think we should consider doing it sooner rather than later."
