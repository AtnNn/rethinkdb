      "I can reproduce this.\r\nIt's pretty weird actually.\r\nIf I issue another `indexWait('field')` on a different connection while the first one is waiting, the other one returns immediately. I can also use the index in a query after roughly 1 second (i.e. `r.table('test').getAll(10, {index: 'field'})` works)."
