      "The reason for why you didn't see it with 1.11 is very likely that sindex creation now uses hard durability (it was part of the fix for #2071). That means that it's waiting for i/o, which it didn't do in 1.11. As a consequence, when you run `indexWait()` immediately after the `indexCreate()`, it will have a much higher chance of not being finished constructing yet. And then `indexWait()` will wait for 10 seconds before trying again.\r\n\r\nI think we might want to change how the polling period works (poll more frequently initially, and then increase up to a maximum of 10s or something), but apart from that this doesn't seem to be a bug."
