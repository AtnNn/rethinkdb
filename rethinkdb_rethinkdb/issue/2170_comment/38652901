      "@danielmewes I've also see something interesting but that I've seen it only with rethinkdbdash.\r\nI tried a few times witht he data explorer but without success.\r\n\r\nIf I do a `indexCreate` query, then an `indexWait` query and then a `getAll` query with the secondary index, I sometime get an error that the index is not ready.\r\n\r\nI haven't tried to reproduce it with the official driver though, but I don't think this is a bug in my driver.\r\n "
