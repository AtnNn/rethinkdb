      "Interesting idea.\r\nOrdering based on pluck arguments in the query sounds a little hacky, but definitely isn't unreasonable.\r\nBeing able to drag columns around definitely makes sense.\r\n\r\nWe'll probably not to this super soon, but will keep it on our list.\r\nWe were thinking about a \"data browser\" feature for the web UI at some point (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1592). This would be especially useful in that context I think."
