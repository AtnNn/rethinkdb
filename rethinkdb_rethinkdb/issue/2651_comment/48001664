      "> I would be ok with this as long as I can still override the configured value by specifying the DEBUG environment variable when compiling. I don't care about overriding test behavior in this case, I just want to be able to build both debug and release modes without having to reconfigure every time.\r\n\r\nSeconded.  I switch between debug and release a lot when working on performance issues.\r\n\r\nI'm actually still slightly bitter that CXX is a configuration flag rather than a `make` flag, but the pain of that has dulled since I basically only use recc now.\r\n"
