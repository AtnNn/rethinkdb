      "I suspect that this might be a race condition in the driver. The test submits a query but doesn't wait until it has been sent over the wire. Then it tries to close the connection, but the `close` callback never gets called.\r\n\r\n@deontologician could you double-check please that the logic in the driver for closing connections looks sane given these circumstances?"
