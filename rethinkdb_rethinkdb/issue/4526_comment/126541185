      "I narrowed down the issue, it seems that the socket is never emitting the \"close\" event, so the final callback is never being invoked. I've tried setting the timeout to 30s 60s, whatever and it never emits the event. Strangely, even without the previous 3 noreply queries, this will still fail on my (OS X) machine. I'm tempted to remove those from the test since they aren't necessary to surface the error.\r\n\r\nI'm also getting some other errors in the tests, but I'm not sure which ones you expect. @larkost would you mind running the tests on your machine from branch josh/4526 ? I have a hack in there that seems to fix the issue, but I want to make sure it isn't causing other unexpected test failures."
