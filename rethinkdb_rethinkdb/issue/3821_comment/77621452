      "Most of the flakiness is because of timing differences on the first batch, and implicit squashing. I have an idea of how to work around this by making the upcoming `fetch` command allow for a timeout to all for things like \"get 2 or 3\", then another command to return just the last N items. That would allow for us to pave over that difference."
