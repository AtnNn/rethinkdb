      "So I just poked around a little more and found why you couldn't reproduce it @coffeemug.\r\n\r\nThe driver has a class ArrayResults from which we copy some methods and add them to Array so people don't have to worry about getting back an array or a cursor.\r\n\r\nThe thing is when we were copying the methods, we were also copying the constructor, which means that if you run\r\n```\r\nr.expr( { ar: [1,2,3] } )\r\na = [1,2,3]\r\nconsole.log(a.constructor) // you get Array\r\nr.expr([ { ar: [1,2,3] } ])\r\na = [1,2,3]\r\nconsole.log(a.constructor) // you get ArrayResult\r\n```\r\n\r\nI fixed the driver so it won't copy the constructor.\r\n\r\nSo if you run for the first query\r\n```\r\nr.expr( { a: [1,2,3] } )\r\n```\r\nYou currently see on the table view `{ ... }` instead of [1, 2, 3].\r\n\r\n\r\nI fixed the driver, updated the code review, and added @wmrowan as a reviewer."
