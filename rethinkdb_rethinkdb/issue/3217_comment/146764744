      "Discovery is much needed, especially in the cloud, when you want to scale up/down nodes and may not be aware of the IP addresses in advance. And even though rebalancing is a manual process - something I hope will change in the future -, just having the opportunity to use the admin UI and have the current cluster nodes available for operations, e.g. rebalance would be a plus."
