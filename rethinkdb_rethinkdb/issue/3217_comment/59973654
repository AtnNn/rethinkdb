      "@dminkovsky Thank you for chiming in here.\r\nI'm interested in your opinion: Would you prefer the DNS based solution over a direct integration with etcd?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how other service discovery / node management systems work in that respect (e.g. Zookeeper)? Is exposing node information through DNS a common technique?"
