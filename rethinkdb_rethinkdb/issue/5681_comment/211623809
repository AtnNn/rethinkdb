      "I found the error... and it is either `coreFoundationUnknownErr` or `errSecCoreFoundationUnknown` depending on where it actually comes from. This is coming out of `darwinssl_connect_step2` in `libcurl`, so there is potentially going to be a lot of digging to do to below this to figure out where either `curl` or the 10.7 `Security.framework` is going wrong.\r\n\r\nMy current view on this is that we probably should not fix this. We know that it does not work on 10.7, but does on 10.10. I will do the work of figuring out what version it does work on, but assuming that it works on something like 10.9 we should probably just say that we no longer support below that and call it a day. we are already most of the way there with the way there with issue #5424, where we disallow compiling with the native version of Clang on that version."
