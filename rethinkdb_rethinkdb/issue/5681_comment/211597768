      "After trying a number of variants, including the latest version of `curl` it looks like we alway have this problem when building with our embedded version. So when built on 10.7 with `--static curl` (really `--static all`) we still get the issue. Building with the `--dynamic curl` flag on any version seems to work correctly. As far as I can tell we are correctly specifying `--with-darwinssl`, and the `curl` build logs seem to bear that out (only oddity is that curl is compiling using `gcc`).\r\n\r\nWith a little help from @VeXocide I got a slightly better error message:\r\n```\r\nError in HTTP GET of `https://rethinkdb.com`: 35 Unknown SSL protocol error in connection to rethinkdb.com:-4960 SSL connect error.\r\n```\r\nI have thus-far been unable to determine what `-4960` is or where it is from (not in curl source code or documented in Apple's Security.framework documentation)."
