      "Could we check for this particular error number and emit a special message stating that `https` is not supported on OS X 10.8 and older?\r\nThat would be my only additional suggestion. Other than that not fixing the issue and dropping full support for OS X older than 10.9 sounds fine to me.\r\n"
