      "I'm ok with the syntax.\r\n\r\n`r.table('foo').index_status()` returning the results for all indexes of `foo` would make my work easier for the web interface (not that it would be really hard --  I can still do an `index_list` followed by a `map` with an `index_status`).\r\n\r\nI feel like `index_status()` without argument being useful, is a consequence of not having `r.args` -- https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1127#issuecomment-20493637"
