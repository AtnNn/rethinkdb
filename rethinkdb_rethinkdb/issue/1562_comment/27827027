      "Yes, we'll hold the release for #1394 and #1571. We could release these independently, but #1394 made it in early and was really important, and @mlucy made a strong case that we should hold the release for #1571.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to move the issue to 1.11 once it's done. Before the release me and/or @atnnn will look at all the closed issues in subsequent, and move them into 1.11.\r\n\r\nI realize that milestoning issues is quite frustrating, so I'm sorry about that. But different people want different things out of the tracker, and I'm trying to hone the process over time. This is the kind of thing that tends to always inconvenience someone and I get the brunt end of it, so it frustrates me too, but I'm doing the best I can."
