      "I can't parse the outdated reads part. Do you mean outdated reads in general? Or just the part where you can say `r.table('foo', outdated=True)`? In both of those cases the QL layer knows if the read is outdated, although presumably the latter one is a bit harder to pipe through. Or is there a case where the QL layer doesn't know at all?\r\n\r\nI'd be cool with dropping the latter syntax, I don't think it's very useful. I'll open a separate issue for it (once I confirm we're on the same page about what you mean)."
