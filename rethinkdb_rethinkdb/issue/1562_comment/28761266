      "It needs docs and it needs me to check that I don't break things with tables that have out-dated reads set. Which is actually something I'd kind of like to get rid of. We've already had to do a lot of workarounds because we don't know in the query language layer whether or not a read gets run as outdated. And it's smelling increasingly like a bad design."
