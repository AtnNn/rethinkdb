      "I don't see why `index_wait` can't be variadic. It's basically just going to be polling using `index_status` which is already variadic. Also I think it'll be useful.\r\n\r\nI don't see much reason not to have `r.table(\"foo\").index_status()` it'll be useful for @neumino since he can get his sindex info in one call. And I think it could be useful to users. It also really doesn't feel like there's much of downside. It also definitely gets better with `r.args`."
