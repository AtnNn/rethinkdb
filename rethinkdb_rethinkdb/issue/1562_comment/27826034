      "That's fine but we really don't seem to be following this at all. Like are we going to hold the release of 1.11 for #1394? The deliverables of that can be shipped completely independently of a major release so it wouldn't make much sense to hold the release up for them. #1571 also doesn't seem like it falls in to this category. I also thought that the point of milestones was so that @atnnn could go through and see what was added during a release cycle if I get this into next before 1.11 ships do I then move this into the 1.11 milestone or does @atnnn know some other way? The reason I wanted to put this in to 1.11 was because I was afraid I'd forget to move it over and this wouldn't be included in the release notes.\r\n\r\nMilestone this however you want. Just know that the way these definitions are constantly changing is really frustrating for me. And from my perspective this is quickly becoming a management tool that can't get out of the way of the things it's supposed to be managing."
