        "Compatibility questions keep coming up in different forms in many different issues. For example #1959, #1890, #1010, and countless others. We're having the same discussion over and over again in different contexts, so I think we should have a more general debate on this, pick a policy, and then stick to it.\n\nAs far as I see it, we have the following options:\n- Don't hesitate to break compatibility on the unstable branch.\n- Put effort into not breaking compatibility on the unstable branch if possible.\n- Don't make any global decisions, and instead make the decision on case by case basis.\n- Try to keep compatibility on the unstable branch until we ship the LTS release, but not after.\n- ...\n\nMy personal opinion is that we shouldn't worry about compatibility on the unstable branch. It's annoying to users, but it also helps us ship quickly.  I think that in a roundabout way it's more beneficial to our users.\n\nOpinions?\n\nPlease participate in this issue (ping @neumino @atnnn @mglukhovsky). If you don't participate in this issue, you don't get to bring up special cases if we make a decision here!\n"
