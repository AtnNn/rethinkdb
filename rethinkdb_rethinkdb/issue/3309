        "tldr; If you try to `rethinkdb serve` and the `rethinkdb` binary is linked to somewhere else (with ln -s, for example), binary can't find rethinkdb_web_assets folder\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\n\r\n1. Fresh install of rethinkdb to ~/path/to/rethinkdb\r\n2. `cd ~/bin`\r\n3. `ln -s ~/path/to/rethinkdb`\r\n4. Add ~/bin to PATH\r\n5. `which rethinkdb` returns the binary you would expect (at the right location)\r\n6. `rethinkdb create` in a folder somewhere\r\n7. `rethinkdb serve` and you get an error saying it can't find rethinkdb_web_assets (which is in ~/path/to/rethinkdb/build/release)\r\n7a.`~/path/to/rethinkdb/build/release/rethinkdb serve` does work\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\nUse alias\r\n"
