        "tldr; If you try to `rethinkdb serve` and the `rethinkdb` binary is linked to somewhere else (with ln -s, for example), binary can't find rethinkdb_web_assets folder\n\nScenario:\n1. Fresh install of rethinkdb to ~/path/to/rethinkdb\n2. `cd ~/bin`\n3. `ln -s ~/path/to/rethinkdb`\n4. Add ~/bin to PATH\n5. `which rethinkdb` returns the binary you would expect (at the right location)\n6. `rethinkdb create` in a folder somewhere\n7. `rethinkdb serve` and you get an error saying it can't find rethinkdb_web_assets (which is in ~/path/to/rethinkdb/build/release)\n   7a.`~/path/to/rethinkdb/build/release/rethinkdb serve` does work\n\n**Workaround**\nUse alias\n"
