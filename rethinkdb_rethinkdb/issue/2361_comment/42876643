      "Hi @angry-elf,\r\nthis is certainly not correct behavior, and we will try to fix this as soon as possible. Sorry for the issues.\r\n\r\nDo you have any secondary indexes defined on the table (if yes, how many)?\r\nWhat is the approximate (average) size of the documents in the table?\r\n\r\nI recently ran into a similar problem while testing something internally (see the comment https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2329#issuecomment-42086988 ). Could be related, though in my case the table doesn't remain in the \"down\" state for very long (but I also have fewer shards)."
