      "Ok, I could replicate this on 1.12, including the high memory consumption, high i/o after restarting and shards remaining unavailable for a very long time after restarting a node in the cluster.\r\n\r\nAll of these issues appear to be gone in the upcoming 1.13.1, and I'm pretty sure they are also gone in 1.13.0 already.\r\n\r\nWith just 6 million smallish documents and 3 secondary indexes, 1.12.4 used 13-20 GB of memory per node in my tests. On 1.13, I get little more than 3 GB under the same workload.\r\nIn both cases I set the cache size to 4 GB. 1.13 apparently didn't even max out the cache size limit (that's because my documents were rather small, about 120 bytes each).\r\n\r\n@angry-elf If you haven't done so yet, I recommend upgrading to 1.13. You will unfortunately have to re-import your data and reconfigure your cluster.\r\nOn a side note: Using more shards than necessary is not recommended for performance reasons. You will usually get better efficiency from using just 3 shards in a 3 node cluster."
