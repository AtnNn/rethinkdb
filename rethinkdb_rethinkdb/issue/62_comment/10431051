      "Ok, so we can't quite do it this way. The reason is that `table.replace` can accept a lambda/reql expression, which allows changing the documents across multiple rows.\r\n\r\nHowever, what we can do is allow people to call replace without specifying pkey inside the document in replace. We'd have to change the server to do it, and since this is a somewhat low priority issue, it'll take a little bit of time to get to it."
