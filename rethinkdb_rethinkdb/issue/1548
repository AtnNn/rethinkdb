        "While attempting to reproduce https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1528#issuecomment-26288132 , I observed the following effect:\r\n\r\n1. Created a table with a 1 GB cache size (256 MB in next until fix for #1538 is in)\r\n2. Inserted about 50 GB of data\r\n3. Ran `rethinkdb dump`\r\n4. Inserted a few more documents once 3 was finished\r\n\r\nAt steps 1 through 3, RethinkDB consumed less than 40 % of the machine's 6 GB of memory (about 35% on average). However at step 4, it very quickly increased to more than 60%, even though the workload was actually identical to the one in step 2. It remained in that region while inserts continued\r\n\r\nThis is a bit odd and I would like to find out why this is happening. There could be a memory leak, or snapshots not unregistered correctly in the cache or something like that."
