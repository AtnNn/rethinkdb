        "Leaving the web UI pointed at `/#tables`, when a new table is added, the table will show up in the databases list, but will have a red circle and the text `Down` in the far right column.\n\nThis happens whether the table was added through the web UI or through ReQL.  This situation appears to clear up when some other change to the metadata is made, such as a new database or table being added (although a new table will exhibit the same behavior).  Also, a simple refresh will suffice.\n\n![screen shot 2014-02-24 at 8 26 01 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/552910/2254310/f9676dac-9dd4-11e3-8315-f319869227da.png)\n"
