        "Recently I had to shut a server down because it was replaced by a new one in a different datacenter. The  old server was still acting as primary for some shards. To shut it down cleanly I was looking for a way to demote the server from any primary roles it had. I could not find any easy way to do that through the web UI, instead I had to manipulate the internal tables (`table_config`) through the data explorer interface. It would be nice if the web UI had native controls to demote or promote a particular server.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0.4"
