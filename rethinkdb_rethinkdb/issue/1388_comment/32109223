      "Okay I was wrong on the socket close semantics.\r\nBut the POSIX API assume that by default you will use buffered writes (as opposed to DIRECT_IO and other wizardery).\r\nIt's not true for rethinkdb: using buffered writes is for advanced used that know what they are doing.\r\n\r\nI don't understand the usecase of reconnect for waiting noreply_waits for example. In what situations would I call reconnect besides that the connection was down or because I just forked my process. In both cases doing noreply_wait is incorrect. Now that's just my opinion. I predict the semantics that you want for to close/reconnect will make more unhappy people than happy people."
