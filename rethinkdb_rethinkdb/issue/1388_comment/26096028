      "@jdoliner: Sure. I will implement `conn.noreply_wait()` as discussed in #1514. `conn.close()` is going to call noreply_wait() automatically, unless explicitly disabled by an optional parameter.\r\n\r\nInternally, the plan is to add a new QueryType NOREPLY_WAIT to the wire protocol. The server responds with a SUCCESS_ATOM (unless there was an error), which for now I guess can just be a null datum. Does that sound reasonable?"
