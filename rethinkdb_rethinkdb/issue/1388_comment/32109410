      "> I don't understand the usecase of reconnect for waiting noreply_waits for example. In what situations would I call reconnect besides that the connection was down or because I just forked my process. In both cases doing noreply_wait is incorrect. Now that's just my opinion. I predict the semantics that you want for to close/reconnect will make more unhappy people than happy people.\r\n\r\nThe solutions to that would be to have `reconnect()` have `noreply_wait` set to false by default, while `close()` would still have true as the default.\r\nThe reason it is true by default for `reconnect()` is mostly to make it semantically equivalent to a `close()` followed by a `connect()`, except that it re-uses the existing connection object. I wouldn't be strongly opposed to making `noreply_wait` false by default for `reconnect()`, but it would feel somewhat inconsistent."
