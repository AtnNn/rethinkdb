      "I also think the timeout would be useful.\r\nIt might be a bit tricky to implement in some of the client languages though, and we cannot easily do it on the server because the server does not process the noreply_wait message at all before all other queries are done. It is certainly easy in JavaScript however. (PS: and @mlucy just told me that it's also easy in Ruby. Not sure about Python)"
