      "@coffeemug Maybe I'm a bit naive, but why would users use noreply=true in the first case? I think this feature should be reserved to expert users trying to optimize the crap out of their applications. If they want fast inserts, users should use the bulk inserts API.\r\n\r\nBecause it can confuse users, we can always do \"As a nice to have, we could emit a warning if one calls close() without having called noreply_wait when at least one noreply write has been performed since the last noreply_wait.\"\r\n"
