      "> If you haven't sent any noreply queries, we shouldn't do a noreply_wait. That avoids a whole class of errors in the common case.\r\n\r\nI don't know what this means.  Wouldn't a noreply_wait do nothing?  What would it do?  How could doing it possibly increase the risk of errors?\r\n\r\n> If you have sent noreply queries, we should do a noreply_wait, but we shouldn't error if we were disconnected. \r\n\r\nIf we are disconnected, do the noreply queries get interrupted on the server?"
