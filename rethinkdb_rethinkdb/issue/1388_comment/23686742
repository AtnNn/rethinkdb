      "I think the current behavior (`wait:0`, or \"kill everything right now\") is pretty bad; if we want to make sure people never get runaway jobs, I'd prefer to default to `wait:true` (@srh's proposal).\r\n\r\n@jdoliner -- how do we currently handle this for sindex creation?  If you create a secondary index where the computation is really expensive and it's killing cluster performance, do you drop that sindex to stop it?"
