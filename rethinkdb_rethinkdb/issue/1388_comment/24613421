      "How about introducing a sync command and having client drivers issue it by default (in a synchronous way) just before closing the connection?\r\nThe server could still abort all operations when a connection is terminated.\r\n(This is essentially an implementation of @srh 's proposal)\r\n\r\nFailing clients wouldn't bring down the server, and it sounds like it would be easy to implement. It would also save us from having to introduce an additional timeout option. If a user needs a timeout, they can wrap it around an explicit sync or even around closing the connection (which would include the sync) on the client side."
