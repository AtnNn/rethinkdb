      "@danielmewes -- it looks like I completely screwed up the order of the discussion in my head. Please ignore my previous comment about the `close` API.\r\n\r\n> And frankly your concerns come a bit late now. Except for tests (which I was just working on) and documentation it is already implemented.\r\n\r\nSorry, but that's not a good reason. I think API semantics are extremely important, and as irritating as it can be, I reserve the right to stop the presses in case I missed something and I think the presses are worth stopping. (which isn't this case though, as I was completely wrong about what I thought the outcome of the discussion was)"
