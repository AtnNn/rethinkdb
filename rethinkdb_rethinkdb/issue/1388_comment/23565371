      "I'd say if you want to interrupt a write query then you care about it enough to not use noreply ... if you don't want to hear about what happened then you've already made a decision about how much it matters.\r\n\r\nnow, in general, it might be useful to have a way to kill running queries without killing the connection, but that should be a separate issue as i when my write operation returns i should expect to be able to close the connection without killing what i thought i just did."
