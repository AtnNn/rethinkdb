      "@coffeemug I felt like we all sort of agreed on different semantics since then:\r\n* srh https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1388#issuecomment-23714655\r\n* mlucy: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1388#issuecomment-23758060\r\n* underrun: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1388#issuecomment-23789058\r\n* danielmewes: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1388#issuecomment-24613421\r\n* jdoliner: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1388#issuecomment-23685072 / https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1388#issuecomment-24613796\r\n\r\nEven you appeared to agree to it, but apparently without realizing:\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1514#issuecomment-25935023\r\nFrom the proposal by mlucy which your comment seems to refer to:\r\n\"We should add an optarg called wait to conn.close. It should default to true, and we should wait before closing the connection, but the user can write conn.close(wait:'false') if they don't want to wait.\"\r\n\r\nAnd frankly your concerns come a bit late now. Except for tests (which I was just working on) and documentation it is already implemented."
