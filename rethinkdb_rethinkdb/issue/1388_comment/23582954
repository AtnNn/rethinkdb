      "Well, one issue I can think of is that it's really hard to program your client in such a way as to fire off a noreply write and not close the connection right away (other than introducing sleep at the end). So if I write code normally (i.e., fire off my writes and close the connection) and the server just drops the writes, it makes the feature kind of useless. "
