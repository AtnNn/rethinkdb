      "I really like the last proposal. The only modification I'd make is to change it from `noreply_wait` to just `wait` (or `wait_for_completion` or something). There are a couple of reasons for this:\r\n\r\n* In Javascript, this problem can occur with any query, not just a noreply one (all I have to do is issue a query, and then call `close` without waiting on the callback)\r\n* Some day our other clients might get async capabilities or multithreading capabilities. In those cases this issue won't be restricted to `noreply` either.\r\n\r\nIt just so happens that users hit this problem mostly with `noreply`, but I don't think it's necessarily specific to `noreply`, so it seems like the fix should be a general purpose solution to this problem."
