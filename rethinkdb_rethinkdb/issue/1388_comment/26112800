      "This is also easy in Ruby.  In `net.rb` there's a variable `@waiters` which is a map from tokens to condition variables, so you'd just haw to spawn a new thread that sleeps 5 seconds before signaling the appropriate one.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the Python client.\r\n\r\nI think we should do this if it's at all plausible -- if we have to think for a bit on how to do it, then we definitely don't want users to have to think too much about it."
