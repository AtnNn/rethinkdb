May be \8216all\8217 or an IP address, loopback addresses are enabled by default.\n\nHowever, it doesn't seem possible to explicitly specify the _interfaces_ to bind to, rather only ip addresses. Is that possible? What if you want to isolate access to a certain interface which is configured via dhcp (and not all of the other potential addresses)?\n"
