      "Just had a conversation about this with @jdoliner, @mlucy, and @mglukhovsky.\r\n\r\nHere's what I think we should do:\r\n\r\n* Instead of \"declare dead\" we should name the button \"permanently remove\"\r\n* We should give a very clear message that says \"if this machine has the only copy of the data, the data will be removed forever\"\r\n* Before users can actually permanently remove a node, they should have to type \"PERMANENTLY REMOVE\" in a message box before clicking the button.\r\n\r\nScheduling this for 1.10."
