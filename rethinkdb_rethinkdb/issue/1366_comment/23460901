      "I think that typing is better than checking off because it requires thought\r\nto perform and not just tabbing through or mindlessly clicking (which is\r\nwhat's required for such a dangerous operation).\r\n\r\nThe proposal to rename this to \"Permanently delete\" isn't describing what\r\nthe user would type in-- it's a recommendation to stop calling it \"Declare\r\ndead\" in the UI, which is an abstraction invented by us that doesn't have\r\nclear implications for those unfamiliar with the system.\r\n\r\nI would require at most one word to be used, e.g. DELETE. The way Github\r\ndoes this with their Danger Zone in the repo settings is a good interaction\r\nstyle to be inspired by.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Aug 28, 2013 at 4:18 PM, coffeemug <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> I'll leave this to @mglukhovsky <https://github.com/mglukhovsky>.\r\n> Personally, I like the idea of asking them to write stuff more, but I think\r\n> a checkbox would be ok too.\r\n>\r\n> \8212\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub<https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1366#issuecomment-23456317>\r\n> .\r\n>"
