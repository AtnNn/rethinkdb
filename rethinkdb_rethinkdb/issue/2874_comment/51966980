      "That basically means that to change the tags, they have to:\r\n- Run some ReQL command\r\n- Update some config files\r\n\r\nI think one of the nice feature of RethinkDB is to be able to shard/replicate without pushing config files. So I feel strongly opposed of not persisting names/tags.\r\n\r\nThey should just have to send some ReQL commands."
