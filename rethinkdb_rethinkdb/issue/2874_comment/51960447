      "If we didn't persist them, we would tell people to put them in the script they use to launch RethinkDB. So for example, they would have a script that calls `rethinkdb -n server1 -t us_east`. If you want to change the tags, then you modify the script and also change the tags in-memory by writing to the `server_config` psuedo-table."
