      "Hi @mscook, thanks for reporting this!\r\n\r\nWhere do you get the number of elements in the table? If you run `r.table(name).count()` what are the precise numbers for old and new versions? Also, if you have raw input readily available, could you see the precise number of documents in the input?\r\n\r\nIf you get the number of documents in the table from the table view in the web ui, note that that number is approximate, and can fluctuate for a variety of reasons. (That will be fixed once we implement constant time count -- #152).\r\n\r\nIf you get the numbers by running the `count` command on the table, that is indeed very worrisome, and we should get the data dump from you ASAP if at all possible. Could you let us know where the number of documents is coming from?\r\n\r\n(Note, the size on disk isn't necessarily an issue, as we continuously work on optimizing disk space release-to-release)"
