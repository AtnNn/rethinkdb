      "Yes! I like `import rethinkdb as r; from rethinkdb import e`. It won't confuse programmers or automated tools.\r\n\r\n@wmrowan: `from rethinkdb import r` and `from rethinkdb import e` are similar in that they both use the `from ... import ...` mechanism, but the problem with `from rethinkdb import r` isn't that it uses the `from ... import ...` mechanism. The problem with `from rethinkdb import r` is that if we encourage people to access the functions and classes via `r.<name>`, then they will think it's strange, and automated tools won't be able to figure out what they're doing."
