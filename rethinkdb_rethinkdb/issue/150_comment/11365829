      "Basically, given that we're adding `r.row` which I think everybody agrees is cleaner than using `r(...)`, `r(...)` is freed for another purpose. This is the best purpose we can give it (aside perhaps for removing it entirely). But since the work is done and it is useful to at least one JavaScript developer who has managed to not become confused by it I'm going to leave it."
