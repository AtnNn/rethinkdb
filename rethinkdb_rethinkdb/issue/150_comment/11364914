      "I'm going to begin making this changes and just wanted to make sure we're all on the same page on what this will actually do.\r\n\r\n1. Instead of `r[...]` performing an IMPLICIT_GETATTR we will have `r.row` return an IMPLICIT_VAR node.\r\n2. `r(...)` will now be a shortcut for `r.expr(...)`\r\n3. There will be no code changes related to the controversial question of whether users should import rethinkdb as r or import r from rethinkdb. Both syntaxes will continue to work with the exception of access to the new shortcut outlined in 2. The real question there is in which we prefer to document for the API docs and public facing material."
