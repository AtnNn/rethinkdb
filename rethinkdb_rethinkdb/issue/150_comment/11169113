      "I cannot speak to what most people will think about the syntax, but my personal opinion on this is as follows. I think we've seen a few types of confusion. One was \"hmm, it's confusing that I can say `r['foo']`\", the other was \"hmm, why can't I access `r['foo']`?\" (because they imported incorrectly). In both cases, the confusion wasn't any bigger than about anything else, and the explanation was perfectly satisfactory, so I don't think this is a big deal for people. Also, in the current proposal, `r('foo')` seems much more sensible because a) jquery pioneered this concept, and b) it's much less frequent. So while this may occasionally cause some issues, I don't really think it's a big enough issue to be a showstopper, and the benefit of dropping `r.expr` is quite high.\r\n\r\nI'd like to ask our go-to people about this (@neumino , @mglukhovsky, and @al3xandru) since they tend to have a very good sense for these things.\r\n\r\n"
