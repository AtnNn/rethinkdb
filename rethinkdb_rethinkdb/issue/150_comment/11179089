      "The `from rethinkdb import r` proposal isn't normal for Python. I'm unaware of any other Python modules that do this. This is bad for two reasons:\r\n\r\n* I think most Python programmers would think it was weird.\r\n\r\n* There are a lot of automated tools for introspecting Python modules, and this proposal could confuse them. For example, `help(\"rethinkdb.table\")` wouldn't work unless we defined everything twice, once as `rethinkdb.r.<name>` and again as `rethinkdb.<name>`. Even if we did that, I speculate that some tools that understand `import rethinkdb as r; r.table` would not understand `from rethinkdb import r; r.table`. For security and performance reasons, some tools parse Python modules rather than executing them, and those would have trouble with this sort of trickery."
