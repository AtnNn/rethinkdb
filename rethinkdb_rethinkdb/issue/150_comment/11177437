      "Right no one ever claimed that the simple nestings are confusing it's when you bind functions that it gets tough. Programmers do understand scoping but due to the complications of embedding a language inside another one it gets very hard to figure out which scoping we're dealing with.\r\n\r\n    def users_of_age(age):\r\n        users.filter(row[\"age\"] == age)\r\n\r\n    benefits_for_different_ages.map(users_of_age(row[\"age\"]).run()\r\n\r\nIt's pretty tough to spot what's wrong with this code."
