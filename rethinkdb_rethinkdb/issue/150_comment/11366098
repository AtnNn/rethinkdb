      "For whatever it's worth, I also find `r` useful in Ruby.  There's always a balance to be struck between how easy something is to learn and how convenient it is once you've learned it.\r\n\r\nI think Python might be a special case, though, since the user experience might be that they accidentally import a different way, and `r` doesn't work any more, and they can't figure out why for the life of them."
