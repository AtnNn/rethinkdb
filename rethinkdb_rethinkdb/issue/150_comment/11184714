      "> Somehow I'd thought we'd already decided to not support the implicit variable on the server.\r\n\r\nI was referring to the nested implicit access from the POV of the user -- right now we don't permit it, and I think we shouldn't reopen this. As far as dropping `IMPLICIT_VAR` from the server, we did agree on it, but I think we didn't consider the issue @mlucy brought up, so it's probably worth exploring this a bit further. \r\n\r\n> I feel like it should be possible to provide the shortcut for people that would find it useful without confusing everyone else.\r\n\r\nI really like the shortcut too. Let's see what @neumino thinks of this after he sleeps on it, and when @al3xandru and @mglukhovsky say about it.\r\n"
