      "Another data point on `from rethinkdb import r`/`r(expr)` is that @neumino thought it was very strange at first glance (although it might mean he's just used to the way we do `r` now).\r\n\r\nAs far as the implementation of `r.row`, shadowing issues, etc. I'd encourage everyone *not* to reopen this can of worms. What we have now is good, and we got to it by having many vigorous debates. Reopening these debates again is unlikely to get us very much, and is certain to be an enormous time sink. I'd prefer to spend the time and mental energy on new things that actually delight people, instead of on fixing something that ain't broke."
