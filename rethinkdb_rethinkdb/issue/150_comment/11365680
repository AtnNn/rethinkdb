      "Currently (in the JS driver) `r(...)` is used as a shortcut for `r.R(...)` which mostly does what `r.letVar(...)` does but can also be used to access the implicit variable. I'd rather change it to `r.expr(...)` and not document it than just not define it (or worse, leave it as is). If people find it useful, let them use it. If JavaScript developers are confused by it they can pretend that it's not there.\r\n\r\nIn Python it will also be defined, but again, if you choose to import as r or just ignore it it might as well not be there. The potential for confusing people is mostly a question now of how we structure tutorials and the like. If the powers that be decide not to introduce this feature in our user materials so be it, but the functionality is already there and at the very least is useful to me so I'm going to leave it in."
