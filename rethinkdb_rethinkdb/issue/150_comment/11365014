      "So I still think that having `r(...)` being a shortcut for `r.expr(...)` is a bad idea for two reasons:\r\n- It's confusing because `r` is also a namespace (as a user on Twitter said)\r\n- For people using jQuery (or at least for me), `$(...)` is more a selector than something to create a node. So if it must be something, it would be more something to access the implicit row than to create an expression.\r\n\r\nI would just not define `r('...')`"
