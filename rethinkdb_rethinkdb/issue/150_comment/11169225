      "Actually, I have another question (probably for @wmrowan). Is it possible to define `r.row` in python and js, or would people have to say `r.row()`? Because the former is awesome, and the latter isn't :) Specifically, we have to support both of the following syntaxes:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.row('foo')\r\nr.row\r\nr.row.extend(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in python:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nr.row['foo']\r\nr.row\r\nr.row.extend(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if there is enough language trickery to pull this off."
