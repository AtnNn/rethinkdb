      "I still think having an object that you import and use like a module is going to just confuse people. It's very unpythonic to do this and if I see a snippet of code using `r` and calling methods on it I'm just going to assume that it's just the module and be fine until suddenly one of its uses breaks. You can't just globally instill this piece of knowledge about how to import and we've already observed this confusing people.\r\n\r\nThis also goes completely against the zen of python."
