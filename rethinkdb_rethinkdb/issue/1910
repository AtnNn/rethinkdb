        "If I run this query:\n\n```\ntable.orderBy('date').nth(0).update({status:'inProgress'}, {returnVals:true})\n```\n\nI get the following error: \n\n```\nExpected type SELECTION but found DATUM: {... it prints the document here ...}\n```\n\nI'm trying to figure out how I can run an atomic update on the first member of a sequence, and know which one I updated. I can't use returnVals with a selection update apparently, so this doesn't work: \n\n```\ntable.orderBy('date').limit(0).update({status:'inProgress'}, {returnVals:true})\n```\n\nI don't actually need the whole document, it would be fine to just get back the id of the document I updated. Is there some way to do this today?\n"
