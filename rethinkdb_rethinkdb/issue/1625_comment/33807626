      "Any news with the rebase/merge?\r\n\r\nWould love to have some working ARM version as I have a project that requires it, it looks like you guys seem pretty close (vs. mongo). I'm pretty sure you've got plenty on your hands already, but I think having official support + continuous integration on a pi would be very good marketing material for the project as a whole."
