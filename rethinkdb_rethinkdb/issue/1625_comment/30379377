      "@davidthomas426, your pull request is awesome! It's probably the most complicated pull request we received so far.\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nWould you mind signing the CLA (http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/)?\r\n\r\nI am not sure that the company can officially support ARM now (because it may require a lot of work and we are just a few people), but I would like to try to maintain an unofficial branch that works for ARM.\r\nI successfully merged your branch with `next` and compile on a Raspberry Pi. A few instructions are missing (like for the `--bind all` flag, but I can still run queries on it, and that's really cool!\r\n\r\nWe would also love to send you a few goodies as a token of our gratitude!
