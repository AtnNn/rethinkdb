      "I'm getting this compiler error: `c++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)`. I can only assume it's got something to do with memory capacity or swap space, but who knows.\r\nAs you know It takes forever to compile so before I get busy trying to fix it I wonder if you guys have any tips (like pre-compilation or cross-compilation) for getting it working?"
