      "@neumino I would like to see this merged. But first it would have to be rebased (or merged) onto next. And until we start testing on ARM every release, I think it might be a good idea for the configure script to print a warning if it detects an arm build, saying something like \"Building and running on ARM should work, but it is not supported. Some features may not work.\""
