        "We should make the cache size parameter configurable at runtime. For this we need to\r\na) expose it as a writable value in the ReQL admin server config\r\nb) pass it through to the cache balancer that distributes cache space between tables, and make it use the new value from that point on\r\n\r\nThe main use case for this are semi-virtualized environments in which one can enforce a memory limit that can be adapted at runtime. Right now it's necessary to restart RethinkDB to either make use of additional memory, or to reduce its memory footprint to allow for a reduction in the system's memory limit, which causes annoying downtime."
