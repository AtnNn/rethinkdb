      "Hi, @BlueT \r\n\r\nI believe this is a dupe of #40 and will be fixed in the next version. I'm not 100% sure that the fix to #40 isn't in 1.2.6 though (no specific commit is referenced in the issue) which means there's a chance you've discovered an alternate way to trip the same assert (or the fact that we didn't actually fix it). I'm going to leave this open until I can confirm in the meantime if it's a pressing issue I suspect that building from source (in next) will give you a binary that doesn't exhibit this problem. We should be pushing 1.2.7 by the end of the week."
