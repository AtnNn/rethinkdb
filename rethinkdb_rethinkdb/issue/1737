        "The `r.merge` command is about to accept a function (#1345). I think the command should have a default, as follows:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.expr([{a: 1}, {b: 2}]).merge(function(doc) { return { c: doc('a').add(1) } })\r\n=> [{a: 1, c: 2}\r\n    {b: 2}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI.e. we don't drop the row, we drop the \"merge\", so the default should be an empty object.\r\n\r\n@mlucy is skeptical: \r\n> my initial reaction is skepticism.  If you try to reference a non-existent field in e.g. an `update` you get an error.  This is important because if we just silently skip merging elements like this, people might think that they're performing a write when in fact nothing gets written to disk.  I might be able to be convinced otherwise, though.\r\n\r\n> Specifically, I'm worried about your semantics for queries like:\r\n```ruby\r\ntable.update{|row| {c: row['a']+1} # error\r\ntable.update{|row| {subrows: row['subrows'].merge{|subrow| {c: subrow['a']+1}}}} # not an error\r\n```"
