The server was crashing whenever I would execute this query:\n\n``` json\n[1,[15,[\"todos\"]],{\"db\":[15,[\"rethinkdb_ex\"]]}]\n```\n\nwhere the first element in the vector is the token, second is the query, third is the global optargs.\n\nwith these logs:\n\n```\nerror: Error in src/arch/runtime/thread_pool.cc at line 352:\nerror: Callstack overflow in a coroutine\nerror: Backtrace:\nerror: Tue Jun 30 15:04:10 2015\nerror: Exiting.\nTrace/BPT trap: 5\n```\n\nThe issue was that I was providing 15 (TABLE) instead of 14 (DB) for my global optarg. So the programming error was all mine, but I wouldn't expect an invalid query to crash the database? Let me know if I can provide more info to help with this. \n"
