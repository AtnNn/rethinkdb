      "I agree with Joe's sentiment that the drivers should all be the same, but this is only one of many cases where the drivers have had divergent behavior, and I think the root cause is technical -- the current drivers are too smart, and the number of ways three drivers can differ increases as the cube of their complexity.\r\n\r\nI think the best way to solve this is by making the drivers simpler (the new protobuf spec lets us do this), and by having more tests for them, or possibly even those language-agnostic tests we keep talking about.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, I don't think this is worth fixing before 1.4 -- the number of people who need this fix and would actually update between now and 1.4 is probably tiny."
