      "I don't know if the old JS driver works or not. It's certainly in the new driver though. In fact, because write queries are just terms that when evaluated modify the database state you can do a sequence of write queries simply by constructing a literal array of inserts, e.g. `r.expr([table.insert(...), table.insert(...)]`. The only thing that really makes `for_each` different from a `map` that returns write queries is the way that results are returned, `for_each` aggregates the results of the write operations into a single summary object."
