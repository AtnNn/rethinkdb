      "This isn't the way it's supposed to work. Giving the message `TypeError: Object #<Eb> has no method 'compile'` in response to:\r\n\r\n    r.expr([1, 2, 3]).forEach(function(row) {\r\n      return [r.table('foo').insert({a: 1}), r.table('foo').insert({b: 2})];\r\n    }).run()\r\n\r\nisn't great. But it's really bad considering that's a perfectly valid query whose equivalent works in python.\r\n\r\nDriver features need to work, this is the version that we'll ship if we make any minor releases between now and 1.4. In fact for all we know it's a version we already shipped."
