      "FYI, since a lot of the existing code is getting thrown out, in the interest of shipping 1.4 on time, a few weeks ago we made the decision not to fix bugs in the driver unless we deem them critical. This is obviously a bug in the old driver, but I also think it's non-critical to get out pre 1.4. So, @wmrowan is following what we agreed on with respect to this."
