      "Right now `zip` is a very specific function which is only useful for the output of a join. The proposal in #325 would replace it with something generic and our current `zip` would be a particular call to this function. We may or may not want to add sugar for that call. Assuming it is called `flatten` as #325 suggests then our current `zip` would be: `flatten(\"left\", \"right\")` and then it's obvious how to reverse it you just say `flatten(\"right\", \"left\")`. I'm actually not sure we want to add sugar for this. For one thing I can't think of a good name for it and I think a lot of times picking a bad name just because it means less typing frequently winds up making things more confusing rather than less. For another thing it's not that much typing and it gives people simple to understand function to use for post processing the results of a join (or group map reduce for that matter.) I also really don't like the idea of having `flatten` be equivalent to `flatten(\"left\", \"right\")` that just seems really ugly."
