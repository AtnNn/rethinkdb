      "I was able to replicate this in qutebrowser and midori.\r\n\r\nLooks like this is due to absolutely stubborn caching of XHR responses. No combination of `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `Pragma: no-cache`, or `Expires` headers could convince these browsers not to cache the POST request that creates a new connection. I ended up adding a random query parameter to the url to finally fix it.\r\n\r\nAs part of this, I found another bug, which is that our code doesn't correctly write tokens > `2^31` to the connection. Not sure if there's any reason to fix that particular bug since 2 billion queries on a single connection is a lot, but it's something we should probably at least have an issue for.\r\n\r\nThe fix is up in CR 2899 by @AtnNn \r\n"
