        "The ops/second dashboard are great, but most highly-loaded sites know that they do as many ops/s as.. traffic demands.\r\n\r\nEven more important is request *latency*--how long is it taking to service various requests at the current traffic level.  This has the biggest impact on user-facing QOS.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see Rethink report request service latency at mean, median, 95th, 99th, 100th ala Riak.  Rethinkdb is a database product with compelling properties, but we wouldn't dream of using it under heavy load (at http://bu.mp ) without being able to monitor, query, and alert on these latency statistics."
