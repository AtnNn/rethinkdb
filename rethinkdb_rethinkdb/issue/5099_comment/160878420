      "hmm, this is somewhat embarrassing, and is perhaps the true cause:\r\n\r\nI have two machines: one a spinning HD (large capacity) and one an SSD.\r\nI had been routing queries to the spinning HD machine. Before the update, I think rethinkdb chose which machine to query.\r\n\r\nWhen I tested tincd, I saw no changes.\r\nWhen I tested a single node -- the HD one -- time was perhaps slightly increased.\r\nBut when I connected directly to the SSD host, the query times dropped dramatically.\r\n\r\nSo, the real issue was that queries got routed to the HD host. I guess that solves this: if you have an  HD host for more storage, route your queries to the SSD machine..."
