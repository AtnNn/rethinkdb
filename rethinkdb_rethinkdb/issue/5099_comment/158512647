      "@avimar Thanks for testing that out. I was mostly interested in the total runtime. So at 20 seconds that still seems to be slow.\r\n\r\nIs the `cdrs` table replicated between the two servers?\r\n\r\nIf yes, could you try replacing\r\n```js\r\nvar query = r.table('cdrs');//from which table\r\n```\r\nby \r\n```js\r\nvar query = r.table('cdrs', {read_mode: \"outdated\"});//from which table\r\n```\r\n\r\nand see if that has any impact on the performance of the query? I recommend keeping the `coerceTo('array')` for that to get an easier comparison.\r\n\r\nI'm also going to send you an email regarding the data."
