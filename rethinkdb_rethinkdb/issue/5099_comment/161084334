      "Thanks for the update @avimar.\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure there isn't more to this. It shouldn't matter what storage the server has that you are connecting to. In either case, the query will be routed to the same primary for processing (unless you use the `read_mode=\"outdated\"` option I mentioned above).\r\nAlso, if you run the same query multiple times, all data should be in cache for the second and subsequent runs and disk i/o shouldn't matter much (unless there's a lot of other load on the servers at the same time).\r\n\r\nI suspect what @encryptio wrote might still play a role. Connecting to the other host might simply have avoided intracluster network traffic."
