      "-Yes -- subsequent queries are faster since they are assumedly cached.\r\n\r\n-I tried playing with the 'outdated' option.\r\n--Connecting to SSD, without outdated: 14 second, then 4 second on retry (cached).\r\n--Connecting to SSD, with outdated enabled: 2.4 seconds, then 1.6 seconds on retry (cached).\r\n\r\n--Connecting to HD, without outdated: 13 second, then 4.3 second on retry (cached).\r\n--Connecting to hD, with outdated enabled: 10 seconds, then 3 seconds on retry (cached).\r\n--These tests are slightly skewed since I pulled a different data set on each query to make sure it wasn't using the cache. Is there a way to disable the cache within the query for this debugging?\r\n--It seems the point that it uses the master unless I set readMode: 'outdated' makes a huge difference. Even polling the SSD machine, it would have to grab it via the HD one. But it seems when I query the HD one, it prefers to do index lookups locally rather than delegate it. So, for now, I use 'outdated' and connect to the SSD host!\r\n\r\n\r\n-With Tincd I saw the same non-change in ping time when I connected to either host."
