      "A lot of the effects here are consistent with something I've seen on some versions of tinc, where `tincd` will drop packets if it is under high load (high packet rate) and the packets also become reordered. The changes in RethinkDB 2.2 put a different kind of load on the network (less overall load, but in different places), which should be fine but might tickle this issue if it already existed. Could you run a `ping -i 0.05 $vpnhost` across the tinc WAN while running the query to make sure there isn't artificial packet loss?"
