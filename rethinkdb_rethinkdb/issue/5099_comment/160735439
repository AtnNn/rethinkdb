      "I haven't been able to reproduce this on a single server.\r\n\r\nWhen everything is in memory, the query takes ~220-240 ms on both 2.1.0 and 2.2.1. With a cache size of 0 and `--direct-io` (so RethinkDB has to load all documents from an SSD in my case), the times are also about the same in both versions, between 800 and 1,100 ms.\r\n\r\n@avimar Did you try the `readMode: \"outdated\"` change I suggested above? Did you see any change in performance from that? Note that this only works if the table is replicated."
