      "In this case if the user has just one machine in the whole cluster, they can't use a datacenter D as a primary one because\r\n- they will have to add a replica in D first\r\n- we won't let them do it because they already have one replica in the whole cluster and have just one machine\r\n\r\nWhile it's not the most important use case, first time users playing with the web interface may run into this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we could do is to remove a replica from /the whole cluster if the user\r\n- set a datacenter as primary that currently has 0 replica\r\n- is going to end up with an unsatisfiable goal if we don't remove one replica in the whole cluster.\r\n\r\nI think that should be safe and shouldn't be hard to do."
