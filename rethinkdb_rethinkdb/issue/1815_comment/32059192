      "This seems like a pretty bad hack -- we'd be handling this as a special case, and we'd be automatically changing a goal (which we shouldn't ever do). I think the right way to do it would be to do it along with #1812. If we can't schedule that in time, I think a better option to deal with the problem you're talking about is to show an error in the web UI (i.e. \"please remove cluster-wide replica\"). I'd prefer to fix #1812, though, will talk to @Tryneus about it."
