      "A replica here will refer as a replica in the web interface, that is to say a copy of a shard (including the master).\r\n\r\nSuppose I have\r\n- Two servers, S0 and S1\r\n- Two datacenters D0 and D1, with one server in each (S0 in D0 and S1 in D1).\r\n\r\nSuppose now that D0 is the primary, and we ask for 1 replica in D1.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if I set D1 as the new primary?\r\n- Do we remove the replica in D0?\r\n- Do we keep the replica in D0?\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't really remember the discussion in itself, but I believe we wanted (and still want?) to be safe and not remove the replica in D0.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
