      "Yeah, organizing them by where they fit in to the query language makes a lot more sense to me at least. The other examples aren't as bad because with `db_table.cc` the operations happen to also all fit in to the same genre of command and `obj_or_seq.cc` is maybe half as bad. It's a bit of a melting pot but they do all have a lot in common."
