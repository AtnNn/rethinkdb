      ">  We're not in the business of developing an IDE. We'll do a very good job of making everything work.\r\n\r\nI agree with the first part, but I completely disagree with the 2nd. We're not providing an IDE, but once we opened the door of suggestions and autocompletion we've entered the space of IDEs and what we provide will always be compared with that (as opposed to being compared with a basic text editor). And IDEs have tried for years to do a very good job and they finally gave up and offered a very fine grained set of settings to tune this.\r\n\r\nI'd be totally fine if the advanced settings would require extra steps to be set (edit a cookie, call a js function from the browser console, etc.). While the initial settings and behavior must be based on our own experience, deciding what's a very good job should be based on what we hear back from the users. Indeed so far I'm the first one and the reason is that I've probably spent a lot of time in the DE. \r\n\r\n"
