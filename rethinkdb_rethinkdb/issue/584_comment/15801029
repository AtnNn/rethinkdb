      "I find myself always using the data explorer function suggestions (I think they're immensely helpful), often using function declaration information from the pop up, and basically never using the in-explorer docs text. Here's what I think:\r\n\r\n1. Introducing a slight delay before popping it up would probably be awesome\r\n2. I find that ESC/TAB functionality and having turned it off on errors is really helpful for the code-covering problem (it basically seized to be a problem for me). Could you give a concrete example of when it's a problem?\r\n3. I think we need to find a way to include mini-docs that are helpful only for the data explorer. Perhaps just a short description + examples, no long descriptions. We'll see what we can do here.\r\n"
