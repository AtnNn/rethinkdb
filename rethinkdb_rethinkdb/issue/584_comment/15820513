      "A lot of things have been said, but here are some of my thoughts\r\n\r\nWe don't have to display a button or menu for these options - or at least I don't really want. it's going to make the interface heavier, and only people who are familiar with RethinkDB wants them (people who don't need suggestions, write fast etc.)\r\n\r\nI think having a shortcut (Ctrl+Space or whatever) to activate/deactivate electric punctuation and suggestions is enough. And that's easy to do, the code for these two features is quite self contained.\r\n\r\nHaving a delay can be a little tricky, I can think of a few little edge cases, but it shouldn't be too hard. If it's somehow too hard, we can skip this one (at least for now). I think @al3xandru would be ok as long as he can activate/deactivate the suggestions.\r\nAbout the delay, I would tend to think that it's a bad idea (I think I would find it a little annoying), but I'm ok to give a try to show @al3xandru and other people so we can make a more fair decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the discussion about whether we provide an IDE, I think we do NOT provide an IDE and don't want to. We have the same input as in mysql-admin, phpmyadmin etc. It's just that we provide suggestions, add some colors to make the experience better.\r\nThe data explorer is still somehow a black box. People cannot use `.run()`, and we bind the callbacks under the hood.\r\nAt least for now, I don't plan to provide something more powerful (I don't really see how I can provide something more powerful anyway).\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I think I need half a day to have a way to activate/deactivate the two options\r\nDoing the delay may be trickier, but I'll give a try."
