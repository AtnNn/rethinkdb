      "As discussed in person, below are the things we have to change in this behavior.\r\n\r\nRequired:\r\n\r\n* ~~Move checkboxes to the left of text~~\r\n* ~~When user clicks on text, it should also register as a checkbox click~~\r\n* ~~On mouse hover, text should get dark (like in history)~~\r\n* The wording for the settings is a little awkward. We should make it more clear and concrete (talk to @coffeemug or @al3xandru or @mglukhovsky when you get to this on how to improve wording).\r\n* ~~Remove `ctrl/cmd + space` behavior that changes the suggestion option.~~\r\n* ~~Make `TAB` and `ESC` keys work regardless of the global setting (the suggestion setting should only turn on and off whether the suggestion box pops up automagically without the TAB).~~\r\n* Better animation when the user switches between history and settings tabs (as discussed with @mglukhovsky)\r\n* ~~Cycling through table names is weird (inside `table()`, hitting tab makes one dialog box pop up, hide, and another one pop up, suggestion hides while the table cycles through names, etc.) -- it's hard to explain in text, so let's discuss in person again if this isn't clear~~\r\n\r\nNice to have:\r\n\r\n* Add `ctrl + space` shortcut and have it do the following regardless of the global setting. When the user presses it, it pops up the suggestions. When the user presses it *again*, it hides the suggestions. If the user hits tab while the suggestions are up, the UI cycles through options like it normally would. Effectively, this would be equivalent to pressing TAB for the first time, and ESC for the second time. (This is nice to have but not required if it's hard)"
