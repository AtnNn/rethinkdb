      "I feel uncomfortable with adding options to the system. We already have two in mind -- an option to turn on and off automatically closing quotes and parens, now an option/link to turn off suggestions. There will be more I'm sure. I really thing it would be best to close this door right now. We're not in the business of developing an IDE. We'll do a very good job of making everything work. If we can't, we'll take it out. But I don't think we should start introducing settings -- it's a battle in which everyone loses."
