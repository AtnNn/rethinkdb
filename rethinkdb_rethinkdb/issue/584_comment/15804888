      "Adding mini-docs is easy to add structurally but of course requires writing a new set of \"mini\" descriptions for all the API functions which is a pain. Why can't we just leave out the examples? Alternatively, we can split the existing descriptions into the first sentence and the rest. The first sentence can be considered the \"short\" description, similar to how GIT expects you to write your commit messages. This might involve tweaking some of the descriptions to have a more summary like first sentence but will be easier and simpler than writing a new set of short descriptions (which have to be kept in sync with the longer forms).\r\n\r\nI think it would also help to render code sections correctly. I'm seeing \"<code>...</code>\" tags directly in the descriptions which not only makes them longer but harder to read. Why can't we render the descriptions as HTML?"
