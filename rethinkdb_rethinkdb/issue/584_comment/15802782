      "@al3xandru feedback is always welcome.\r\n\r\n1. I am not really familiar with many suggestions systems, I have only used eclipse and bpython.\r\n\r\nBpython doesn't have any delay, and is quite close to what we have.\r\nEclipse have a short delay (probably less than 10 ms), but I highly suspect that it's just because it's slow. @al3xandru do you have an IDE in mind so I can check how it feels?\r\n\r\nAdding a delay isn't in itself too hard but what's tricky are all the edge cases that we have to think about.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. You can hit ESC if you want to hide the suggestions, but they will come back as soon as you hit a key.\r\nOr do you want to be able to be able to permanently activate/deactivate suggestions?\r\n\r\n3. I completly agree with that and I think there are too reasons why they are hard to read\r\n  - It's not well structured (because I just get plain text from the docs)\r\n  - It's still a *small* popup.\r\n Like @coffeemug said, the best solution would be to have mini examples, but that's some extra work and make things a little harder to maintain. Or maybe it's easy to do with the new docs system (I didn't have time to look at it). Any thoughts @wmrowan?"
