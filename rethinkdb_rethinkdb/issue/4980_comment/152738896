      "@danielmewes @coffeemug Sorry for the delayed response.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the logs dont give much info about the crash, neither do they seem to be due to an OOM\r\n\r\nWe do have swap configured. That could definitely be a possibility.\r\n\r\nHere's an update since last week.\r\n\r\nI believe a lot of the issues were due to high load. We saw sudden peaks in the system (writes to the system), when these issues emerged. I had since turned on soft durability, and it has been fairly stable since. Its been 6 days since the last crash.\r\n\r\nBut, Im still a little worried about the crashes, Im unsure of why it occurred and whether they will occur again.\r\n\r\nI'll check on the core dumps and get back to you. (This is sensitive data)\r\n\r\nI'm looking at upgrading to 2.1.5-2 this coming week. Just wanted to understand how long would rebuilding the index post the update take?"
