      "Did you see any messages about a \"heartbeat timeout\" in the logs when the disconnects happened by any chance?\r\n\r\nThe raft election should not cause disconnects (unless of course there's a bug, which is possible). I think it's more likely that something else caused a disconnect, and as a consequence the servers started raft leader elections since they had lost contact to the previous leader. This is an expected reaction to losing connectivity to one or multiple other servers."
