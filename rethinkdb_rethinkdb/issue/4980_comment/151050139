      "@mariostallone -- is there anything in the logs about the latest crash? This is unfortunately very challenging to debug because there is almost no information.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility (which would help enormously) is to enable core dumps on the servers that run RethinkDB, and then send us the dumps. Do you think it would be possible to do that?"
