      "To clarify the first incident: Do you mean the two other servers got disconnected due to some problem in RethinkDB, or were they disconnected due to unrelated reasons (maintenance, networking issues etc.)?\r\nNote that Raft elections are expected to fail if only one out of three servers are left.\r\n\r\nFor the second issue where RethinkDB terminated: In addition to RethinkDB's log files, you might also want to check your kernel log (`dmesg -T`, might also be logged to `/var/log/syslog` and/or `/var/log/messages`) for messages concerning out of memory conditions. If RethinkDB ran out of RAM, the kernel's OOM killer might have terminated it, in which case you wouldn't see anything in the RethinkDB log (but it would generate a message in the kernel log)."
