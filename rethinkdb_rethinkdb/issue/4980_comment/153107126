      "@mariostallone was the latest crash you mention after your upgrade to 2.1.5?\r\nWas the process actually gone or is it possible that it simply became too slow to handle requests anymore? The latter could happen if the process went into swap. It would appear almost as if the server was completely stuck, but obviously the `rethinkdb` process itself would still be running.\r\n\r\nYou might want to try reducing the cache size to free up some memory and stop RethinkDB from going into swap. You can see its current value in `r.db('rethinkdb').table('server_status')`. The cache size can be changed through the `--cache-size <MB>` command line argument to `rethinkdb`, or by adding a line `cache-size=<MB>` to the instance configuration file."
