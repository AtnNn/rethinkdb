      "@coffeemug @danielmewes Thanks for your responses..\r\n\r\nAnswers to the questions...\r\n\r\n\"when it was trying to elect a new raft leader\" - I was referring to the logs where leader election was happening internally, which seems to have been the cause for the disconnection... I assumed that it might have been the cause as these were the last few messages in the logs...\r\n\r\nTo clarify the first incident : I believe the other two servers got disconnected due to some problem that might have arisen from the raft election process, as these were the last few logs I saw before the other servers were disconnected...\r\n\r\nAbout the second incident, which occurred once again, I noticed that it might have been due to an OOM situation as you suggested...\r\nI'm looking at migrating to using rethinkdbdash and might look at using monit or another process monitor which would help in restarting rethinkdb if it were to fail again...\r\n\r\nMy only open question now: Is there a possibility that the raft election process would have caused the other 2 nodes to get disconnected?"
