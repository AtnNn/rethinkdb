      "@mariostallone Is it the one you mention in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4675#issuecomment-150931694 ? Was that still on 2.1.4? I recommend upgrading to 2.1.5 first. We've fixed a bunch of potential segmentation faults in that release (see the release notes for details: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/releases/tag/v2.1.5-2 )"
