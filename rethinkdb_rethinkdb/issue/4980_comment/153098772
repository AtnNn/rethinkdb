      "This is concerning because RethinkDB doesn't just crash during high load -- there must be something else going on. If there is nothing in the logs, the most likely culprit is the OOM killer (because it doesn't give the process the opportunity to log a segfault). \r\n\r\nHow are you deploying/running RethinkDB? One possibility is that your deployment tools might be spinning up a new VM every time you restart RethinkDB, so you wouldn't see the OOM killer in the `dmesg` logs. \r\n\r\nIf we can't figure this out in the next day or two, would it be possible for us to get access to the servers? (we can sign an NDA if necessary)"
