      "Yes @danielmewes.\r\nThe logs on both the other servers were similar to the one below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDATET20:39:50.723437503 1482605.220926s notice: Disconnected from server \"rethinkdb1\" <hash>\r\nDATET20:47:19.283573311 1483053.781061s notice: Connected to server \"rethinkdb1\" <hash>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere was another crash today as well. None of the crashes seem to have happened due to oom. Can't find a single log pointing in that direction. The only thing we observed is high disk usage before the crash. \r\n\r\nAdditional Info.\r\nI'm running rethinkdb v2.1.4\r\nRunning on Linux 2.6.32-431.29.2.el6.x86_64 x86_64\r\nThe only table on the DB has 3 shards with 2 replicas per shard.\r\n\r\nI've just made a change to use rethinkdbdash. I'm hoping making connections via a pool to all the machines in the cluster as opposed to just one would spread the load across."
