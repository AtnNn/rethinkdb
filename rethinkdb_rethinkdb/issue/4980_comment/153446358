      "@coffeemug These are physical servers, and Im fairly certain that the logs are not purged between rethinkdb restarts...\r\n\r\n@danielmewes I'm still on 2.1.4. Will be doing the upgrade today. If it crashes even after that, we'll work out a way to give you access to the server.\r\nThere have been instances where the server was unreachable but hadn't crashed, earlier. But this instance was a genuine crash.\r\n\r\nI'll look into the swap issue. If there's a lot of memory being dumped into swap, i'll reduce the cache size."
