        "I propose that we implement a term `random` which generates random numbers.  (Joe already mostly has code for this.)\n\nI think that `r.random` with no arguments should return a random double in the range `[0, 1)`, or `r.random` with a single integer argument `n` should generate a random integer in the range `[0, n)`.  This is an interface I've seen in other places (e.g. Ruby's `rand`) which is very useful and intuitive.\n\n``` ruby\n> r.random.run\n0.405153641574112                                                                         \n> r.random(5).run\n2\n```\n"
