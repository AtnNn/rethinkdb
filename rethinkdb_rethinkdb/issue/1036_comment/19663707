      "So, I agree with @jdoliner, and as I mentioned in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/889#issuecomment-19663541 with @neumino. I think it would be better to take the recursive polymorphic behavior out in all commands. It's a neat trick, but after thinking about it a bit it seems less useful, and doesn't seem very relevant once we implement static value sugar for dealing with nested elements (including arrays)."
