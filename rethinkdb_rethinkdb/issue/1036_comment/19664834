      "> so we would make `has_fields`, `pluck`, `with_fields`, etc. only go one level deep?\r\n\r\nThis is what I'm proposing, yes. (I'm not unequivocally saying that we *should*, just that it seems like a good idea to me and that we should discuss it and see if my intuition holds up).\r\n\r\n> You can no longer say that `seq.pluck(...) <=> seq.map{|x| x.pluck(...)}`\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand -- why is it that you can no longer say that?"
