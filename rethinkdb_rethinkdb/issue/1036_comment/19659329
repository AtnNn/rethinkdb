      "I think it would be really confusing to have this behave differently from `pluck` and friends.  It would also make `with_fields` not do what you want, since `with_fields` is just `has_fields` followed by `pluck`.\r\n\r\nNote that `has_fields` doesn't strip out non-object non-array elements from the sequence, so it wouldn't solve your problems in any case.  Its role is to take a sequence of objects and return a sequence of objects, not to take a sequence of arbitrary types and return a sequence of objects with all other types excluded.  Making it recurse into subsequences makes more sense in that context than making it error, at least to me."
