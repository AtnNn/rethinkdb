      "@coffeemug -- so we would make `has_fields`, `pluck`, `with_fields`, etc. only go one level deep?  I'm not necessarily opposed to that, as long as we make a consistent choice for all of them.\r\n\r\nThe main problem I have with not recursing is that it sort of complicates the evaluation model (both on the server and in people's heads).  You can no longer say that `seq.pluck(...) <=> seq.map{|x| x.pluck(...)}`.  That might be OK, though."
