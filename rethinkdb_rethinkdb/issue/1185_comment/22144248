      "So I think we might do better with this by displaying less context rather than trying to automatically format multiline queries so they look nice. It's going to be really hard to format queries from multiple different languages correctly since their syntaxes look so different. What if we just had the simple rule that we take the term in which the error occurred and add parent nodes for context until we hit an 80 char line limit. So in @atnnn's example you would see:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRqlCompileError: Cannot use r.row in nested queries.  Use functions instead. in:\r\n\r\nr(0).sub(r.row(\"b\")).add(var_2).div(r.row(\"a\").mul(2))\r\n         ^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think in most cases this will give you fairly readable output regardless of the input language and should be enough to let you figure out where the error occurred. I think in general having a huge wall of text as output is just going to be a lot more overwhelming even if there are a few cases where it lets you place the error a bit better."
