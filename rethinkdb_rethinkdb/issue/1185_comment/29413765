      "Returning just a piece of the query generates a poor experience for the users.\r\nIf you run a query on multiple tables and join them with `union`, you will have no idea where your query will fail if we return just a piece of it.\r\n\r\nOur backtraces are broken and we should fix it. We don't need to over engineer a test for the backtraces. We can just test a set of broken queries for now, and every time we find a bug, we add another query in the set."
