      "Since there is a discussion around this now, I have a few thoughts on this:\r\n\r\n* I'm in favor of @jdoliner's solution above (displaying only the relevant context), or at least its spirit. It has a virtuous combination of being easier than writing a good pretty printer, being sufficient to tell what's going on, and being better than what we have now. It seems to have a really good bang for the buck ratio.\r\n* I think there may be some subtleties to work out -- for example if I have something like `command(arg1, arg2, arg3)` and I have an error in `arg2` it may be better to print `command(..., arg2, ...)` if the other arguments are too long.\r\n* Also, if we work on enhancing error output, it would be *awesome* to also return and print the environment. This may be a whole separate issue, though, but I think it's important to make ReQL more pleasant. There is still a lot of trial and error and guesswork that goes on when people hit ReQL errors, and printing the environment/stack would go a long way to eliminate that."
