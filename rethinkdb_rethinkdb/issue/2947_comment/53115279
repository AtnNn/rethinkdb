      "This is my fault, the http stream is not respecting the `batchspec_t` (because it doesn't really have control over the size of the batches), which is fine in the general case, but the `datum_stream_t` code expects `batchspec_t::all()` to finish out the stream.  This is a pretty simple fix, sorry about the crashes, @chrisvariety!\r\n\r\nScheduling this for 1.14."
