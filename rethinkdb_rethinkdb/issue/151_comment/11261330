      "Ah, I think I know what you mean. You can already rename databases and tables in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. From the web UI -- click on the relevant database or table, click on operations button on top, and click rename.\r\n2. From the CLI. Here's how you do it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrethinkdb admin -j HOST:intracluster_port\r\n> set name [OLD_DBNAME/OLD_TABLENAME] [NEW_DBNAME/NEW_TABLENAME]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI agree that this functionality should be in the clients. Moving to backlog as a feature."
