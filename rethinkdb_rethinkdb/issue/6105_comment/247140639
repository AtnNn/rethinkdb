      "Because of a similar (but more frustrating) situation in `node.js`, I am reworking how we detect our interpreters, which winds up paving over this situation altogether. I will leave this open until that is checked in, but anticipate that I will not merge this.\r\n\r\nThis is what I am working on right now, so anticipate that will be in `next` in the next day or two."
