        "Inserting documents into a table with two shards on two nodes suffers under the following effect:\r\nAt first, the insert rate is steady at ~30k inserts/s. It remains at that rate for a few minutes.\r\nThen it suddenly drops to 3-4k inserts and is very unstable, fluctuating between ~7k and 0.\r\n\r\nLooking at iostat / htop, I can see that i/o fluctuates as well, between 0 (for about 2 seconds) and ~10 MB/s write rate. CPU usage is extremely low as well, temporarily dropping to 0 as well.\r\n\r\nIf I stop the inserts and restart them immediately (let's say 3 seconds later), the situation remains unchanged.\r\nHowever if I pause them for somewhat longer (~20 seconds), the insert rate increases to its original rate of 30k/s when restarting them. However it drops again after a while of inserting."
