      "OK, so it turns out that this occurred because I was running a version of RethinkDB built from source, which had a hash attached to the version number. Importing it with 1.9.0 worked fine, whereas 1.9.0-58-gf388e4 produced this error.\r\n\r\nI still should be able to restore data, even when running version built from source."
