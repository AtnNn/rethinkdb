      "I think once we have https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3296 we should just increase the batch timeout for changefeeds to something much higher (or make them not time out at all).\r\n\r\nOr do you mean we should never wait for the client sending a CONTINUE, even after we've just sent it a (batch of) change(s)? Would we stream all changes over the connection as soon as the changes happen then?\r\nI think that might be problematic because if the client doesn't process the changes quickly enough, they would fill up the TCP buffer blocking other concurrent queries running over the same connection."
