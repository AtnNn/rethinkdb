      "@Tryneus Ah fair enough, that might actually work. The second question then is what to do with all the incoming changes on the client. You probably don't want to load them all into memory indefinitely if they are not getting processed from the cursor.\r\nOn the server we currently handle this by discarding changes if the client isn't reading them quickly enough, and instead send it a \"N changes skipped\" notification. If we always push them out to the client regardless of whether the client is processing them or not, we would have to implement a similar logic in the client then right?"
