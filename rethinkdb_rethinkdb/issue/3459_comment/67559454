      "That's basically the goal of the current system: we wanted the client to be responsible for notifying the server when it wants more data, because it's easier to handle the case where we get backed up on the server than to expect users to handle it in the client.  If we wanted to get rid of the current batching system, I think we should add some explicit flow control (i.e. the \"give me a new batch\" messages would be replaced with \"send me more data\" and \"stop sending me more data\" messages) rather than relying on TCP's flow control, just because it's easier to reason about and tweak.\r\n\r\nThe clients all prefetch one batch ahead, so right now if the network latency is small we should get a flow rate roughly equal to the production rate on the server or the consumption rate on the client, whichever is slower."
