      "@danielmewes, I had considered that, but it still leaves us with the same problem in the case of cursors.  Unless we fill up a buffer on the client side and use peek to refuse to read out more if the buffer is full - which would lead to a deadlock if the client is waiting on a different result.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should just change to [SCTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol)."
