        "The `rdb_erase_small_range()` function iterates over a range using `btree_depth_first_traversal()`, finds all key-value pairs, and dispatches deletion operations to erase those key-value pairs. However, it ignores deletion entries, so they will be left in the B-tree even after the erasing is done. I don't think this causes any bugs, but it wastes disk space."
