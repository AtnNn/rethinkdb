      "@danielmewes I like the idea. Errors are not the common case and shouldn't be treated as such. The 0.01% (or whatever) of requests which result in an error shouldn't be treated as data the way they currently are. Errors are and will always be exceptional cases and shouldn't be treated like normal responses.\r\n\r\nA related question: how does the current response help the user? If 5 of 10 documents resulted in an error and the other 5 in a successful insert, what now? Other than for statistical purposes, is there actually any use for them? Can the application logic do anything useful with these information? I'm not asking to remove them by any means, just trying to say that the fact that an error happened is far more important than the exact details."
