      "@Prinzhorn The one thing I can think of is that an application might want to \"roll back\" changes as soon as some of them succeeded. But I think that's a rather rare / special scenario.\r\n\r\nI think it's still important to communicate that the operation hasn't failed completely, but only partially. Otherwise someone might assume that it's save to re-run the write until it (fully) succeeds without any side-effects. That is generally not the case, since the earlier partial writes might already have changed the data and applying the same operation a second time can have unwanted effects (e.g. imagine a write that increments a counter in the documents)."
