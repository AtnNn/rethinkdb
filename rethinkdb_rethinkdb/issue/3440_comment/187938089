      "@mlucy \r\n\r\nthanks for the explanation\r\n\r\n> That said, it might be better to force people operating under the second model to catch exceptions every time they issue a write rather than forcing people operating under the first model to check the write summary object for errors.\r\n\r\nI agree, but now I also understand that things aren't as easy as they seem.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely important to have a new error type so people under the second model are able to distinguish using sth. like `instanceof` (in case of the node driver). While people under the first model can just treat every error as a equally bad thing."
