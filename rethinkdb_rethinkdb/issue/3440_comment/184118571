      "I'd love to see this as an option. For first time users it's currently confusing and it's also cumbersome. Inserting or updating a single document is a very common use case (and the reason for the current setup is multi-document-writes). The fact that an error might not actually result in an error makes this confusing for starters. I currently have to do something along the lines of this (node.js driver example)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table('history').insert(history).run(req.app.rConn, function(err, result) {\r\n\tif(err || result.errors > 0) {\r\n\t\treturn next(err || new Error(result.first_error));\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich doesn't look nice at all and I have to write it over and over again. And as I mentioned users new to RethinkDB (such as myself) might not realize this and only check for the error parameter and silently ignore errors."
