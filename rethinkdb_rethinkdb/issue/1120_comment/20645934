      "Alright, this is settled.  I'm stealing the pathpec proposal from https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1094 into this issue.\r\n\r\nI talked to Joe about this earlier, and here's what we settled on:\r\n* `orderby` should take arbitrarily many functions and pathspecs\r\n* We'll turn the result of `asc` and `desc` into a new psuedo-type so that it can be included in arrays or objects.  These objects will be of the form:\r\n```\r\nr.desc(1) =>\r\n{:__reql_type__ => 'ordering',\r\n :direction => 'desc',\r\n :data => 1}\r\n```"
