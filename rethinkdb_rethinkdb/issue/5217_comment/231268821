      "Following up here, I'd love to see this as well.\r\n\r\nAlso would love to see passing first_error as the first parameter in callbacks, so that I don't have to check for errors twice (ie that sometimes with `function callback(err, result)`, `err` is null even though there was an error). Already been bitten by this a few times, and it doesn't seem like there's an intuitive reason to break the generally-accepted (err, result) callback pattern.\r\n\r\nFrom the [docs](https://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/insert/):\r\n```\r\nRethinkDB write operations will only throw exceptions if errors occur before any writes. Other errors will be listed in first_error, and errors will be set to a non-zero count. To properly handle errors with this term, code must both handle exceptions and check the errors return value!\r\n```"
