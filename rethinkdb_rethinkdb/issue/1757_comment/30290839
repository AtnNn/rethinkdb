      "@neumino -- You're inserting `test` into itself, so my guess would be that before you get to the end you start seeing some of your own writes.  I would guess that you don't see this behavior when you insert from one table into another.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner -- this behavior seems strange; shouldn't he have a snapshot of his table that prevents him from seeing his own writes here?"
