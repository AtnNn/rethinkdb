      "@danielmewes I guess the disk would be a bottleneck here as there is about 2GB of data in my table, I think the optimization would be a good idea as there is no need to load all of this data. An implementation for a count just on the group would not require a traverse of the index as the count is on the index itself, I may be wrong."
