      "@jrote1 `fold` would be ordered, but it probably won't help if the bottleneck is reading the data from disk (which it sounds like it is here).\r\n\r\nWe could indeed implement an optimization that avoids loading the whole document in this particular scenario since we could extract the group output from the index. This is simply not implemented. We would also still need to traverse the whole index, since indexes in RethinkDB do not store subrange counts. This is something that we would like to implement soonish, but it's not trivial. See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3949#issuecomment-84143955 for that feature."
