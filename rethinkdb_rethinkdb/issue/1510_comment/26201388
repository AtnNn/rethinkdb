      "V8 project has a number simultaneous releases - stable/dev/trunk. As it turned out the latest release I was testing (3.22) is actually trunk and V8 team does not recommend to use it unless you are a Chrome developer. Stable V8 release is defined by Chrome releases (see http://omahaproxy.appspot.com/), and at this point V8 version 3.20 is stable.\r\n\r\nI compiled rethinkdb against V8 3.20 and no changes are needed - rethinkdb 0.10 compiles/works fine. So the API change I mentioned earlier was introduced in V8 3.21/3.22. Of course at some point 3.21 will be marked as stable and rethinkdb change will be needed."
