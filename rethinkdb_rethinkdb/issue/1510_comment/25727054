      "Statically linking v8 is already easy to do. Pass `--static v8` to `./configure`. You must have libv8.a available or also pass `--fetch v8`. `--fetch v8` will always fetch and build with v8 version 3.19.18.4. Our osx, centos and lucid packages are all built with `--fetch v8 --static v8`.\r\n\r\nLooking at the actual diff, we could avoid having ifdefs everywhere by using a `typedef v8_scope_handle_t ...` and a new function `v8_scope_handle_t new_v8_scope_handle()`"
