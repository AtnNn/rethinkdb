      "@chrisabrams - Thanks for the report.  Some more questions:\r\n\r\n- Did the `rethinkdb_data` directory still exist?  Are you saying that it existed and was empty?  Or was it removed entirely?\r\n\r\n- Could something else you're running have `rm -r`'d the RethinkDB directory or its contents?\r\n\r\nThe only working theory I have is that if the rethinkdb_data directory or its contents were removed by some other process, you'd get an error the next time a file was created.  It sounds like the `rethinkdb_data/tmp` directory didn't exist when the post_construction_0d5ec735-88b0-45c5-a11d-996437530ac2.create file's creation was attempted.\r\n\r\nRight now I don't have any other theories.  If there was a bug in the clustering layer that caused rethinkdb to remove all of its tables, it would still leave the `tmp` directory around, and also the removal of auth_metadata, metadata, log_file are implausible.  Another possibility is that the rethinkdb process itself decided to remove all the files in its directory for a different reason.  But there's no code in rethinkdb that recursively deletes directories.  The rethinkdb executable has no code that deletes any directories.  There's no `rmdir` calls, and no calls to libraries that manipulate the file system."
