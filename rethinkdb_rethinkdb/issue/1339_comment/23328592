      "@chrisabrams -- we can't reproduce this issue internally, and as of now we don't have any plausible theories as to how this could have happened. Unfortunately, there isn't much for us to go on as of now, so we'll have to watch out for this issue in case it shows up again. Here's what we're going to do in preparation for an LTS release:\r\n\r\n1. Do another code audit (with a couple of eyes on it) to try and find even remote theories for how this could have happened, and bullet-proof the code against anything we come up with.\r\n2. Log all files rethinkdb removes (as pointed out by @srh above), in case this happens again.\r\n\r\nI'm really sorry you ran into this, we're working hard to come up with anything plausible, and we'll fix the issue the moment we have more information."
