      "Hmm, so basically what's happening here is that when you create a secondary index RethinkDB will create a file for \"post construction.\" \"Post construction\" is the process of taking all of the values which were already in the table and putting them in to the secondary index during this time it uses a file (the one that we failed to open) as a journal of live updates which we can replay when the post construction is complete.\r\n\r\nA few cursory questions: \r\nI have no plausible hypothesis for how this could result in data loss. The post construction file is kept separate from the main data files. Could you check in the \"rethinkdb_data\" directory? For each table you've created there should be a file with a uuid for its name which holds the data for the table. Are these files still present?\r\n\r\nWhat version of RethinkDB are you running?\r\n\r\nWhat happens when you try to access the data?"
