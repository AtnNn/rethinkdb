        "The `init_small_fuzz.rb` test is a slight modification of `init_fuzz.rb`. The differences are:\r\n1. It uses fewer initial documents\r\n2. It shards the table\r\n3. It uses a slightly different query\r\n4. It validates the document count at the end, which `init_fuzz` does not do\r\n5. It runs the test multiple times (because failures have often been intermittent)\r\n\r\nThose tests should be merged back together, and instead of just validating the document count, we should validate the actual contents of the documents as well."
