      "`returnChanges` works fine for me in the JS driver.\r\nPassing `return_changes` works too.\r\n\r\nWe strictly enforce the options available in `run`, but not in other commands.\r\n\r\nPutting in backlog for now. We can eventually strictly enforce the options at some point. That would require a bit of refactoring though."
