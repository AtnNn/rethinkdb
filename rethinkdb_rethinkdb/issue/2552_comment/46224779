      "I'd strongly prefer we tack on a random number (say `machinename-wxyz`) where `w/x/y/z` are each a number between 0-15 (basically a hex digit). I think that would be immensely better than occasionally introducing a conflict. Even if users can just ignore it, it's confusing and results in a really bad flow IMO.\r\n\r\nI do agree we should take out port offsets from machine naming (since people can and do restart on different ports). I think tacking on a random number is pretty much the best we can do."
