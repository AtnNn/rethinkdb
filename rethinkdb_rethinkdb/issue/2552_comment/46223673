      "> It is very easy to resolve name conflicts in the admin UI after all.\r\n\r\nI think that would be bad, for a couple of reasons:\r\n\r\n- It would be annoying to start the cluster and then discover it's in a bad state for a somewhat tangential reason. I think that if we can avoid bad states that require user interaction, we should, especially during the setup stage.\r\n- There is no real way to handle these issues programmatically now, and manual resolution, especially on larger clusters, is annoying.\r\n\r\nI really think this should work out of the box."
