      "I agree that in almost all cases, letting the user change the name manually would be perfectly fine. But, IMHO, a big red conflict issue displayed in the admin page might scare the newbies who will see the message for the first time, though it doesn't hurt any availability.\r\n\r\nAlso, the current \"start a cluster\" tutorial is prone to a name conflict. Of course it can be fixed by adding `--machine-name` or something. But I think that the longer the command, the less sexy it becomes, especially for the newcomers."
