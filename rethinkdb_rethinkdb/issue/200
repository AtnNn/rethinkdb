The winner is this one:\n   https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/generic/multi_throttling_client.cc#L89\n   (351 chars long)\n   Even on my 24\" full screen, it wraps. Besides, it remove any hopes to open two files vertically.\n   It's really hard to read (which is not helpful for contributions).\n   I wish you _also_ inspired yourselves from btrfs code style.\n   Can we have 80 chars max? (if it's really hard for you, can we do 120 chars) ?\n2. Some piece of code are really huge, and heavily nested. Example:\n   https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/reactor/reactor_be_primary.cc#L150-L208\n   This is hard to read, thus to review, which leads to poor quality code. This kind of complexity would be avoided with a max line length since the author would have had to extract logic in digestible functions.\n"
