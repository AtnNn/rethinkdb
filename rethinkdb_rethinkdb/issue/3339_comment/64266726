      "Thank you for the suggestion @solatis . We are considering adding additional language support for server-side processing (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1973), but that's a very low priority at the moment.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that ReQL has become pretty expressive at this point and most tasks can be performed natively in ReQL. In the few cases where that's not the case, `r.js()` provides a way to work around those limitations."
