        "This will make it much easier/cleaner for the webui to listen to changefeeds on the admin tables. It has the downside of needing a websockets implementation on the server. I think a custom implementation of a standard protocol is better than the custom implementation of a custom protocol, but it would be potentially a lot of work unless there's a library we could bend into shape. In addition, the abstraction of socket -> websocket is probably closer than what we have now to adapt the js driver to talk to the http connection (i.e. we could dump a lot of code in the js driver) There was an issue about removing the http connection stuff from the js driver that I can't find at the moment.\n\n[Implementing the websockets protocol from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets/Writing_WebSocket_servers)\n"
