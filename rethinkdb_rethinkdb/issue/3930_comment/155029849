      "I've been working on the scala driver for past 2 years or so.. Its strictly typed so it may help in providing a guide on some of the quirks I ran into. Just a note group/ungroup may not be possible to type with java. I had to go thru some tricky scala setup to half way get it to work.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kclay/rethink-scala\r\n\r\nI've been meaning to relax some of the code to provide a java version but since the official driver is being made maybe someone can try porting over some of the typed stuff. But for the most part most of the typed code can be ported as is.\r\n\r\nI started to implement some streams a bit (scalaz-streams) but will be looking into adding other support (RXJava/Scala and alike).\r\n\r\nFunny you mention the dsl @tyth, I actually had an issues for reworking with the official driver, kclay/rethink-scala#46. Maybe somehow we solve both of theses. "
