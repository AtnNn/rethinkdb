      "Awesome thanks! Last question if you don't mind answering (I don't know where else to ask). I've already got a test integration working with a project of mine. How does the `.filter` function work? I tried doing something like `.filter(new Javascript(\"\"\"{\"userId\":\"Mary\"}\"\"\"))` with no dice. I couldn't find any examples in the test spec.\r\n\r\n(Note: the triple-quote is a Scala-ism)"
