      "@mattias800 \r\n> Having it return instances of your own classes would be a great feature though.\r\n\r\nThis (in essence: ODM / object-document-mapping) could be compared to e.g. what Morphia is doing for MongoDB on top of their normal java driver and I would strongly suggest to have it in a library separate from the basic driver. Definitely needed, but definitely a different beast than the basic DB driver."
