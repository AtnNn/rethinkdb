      "I've been meaning to add more javaness to my Scala driver(   https://github.com/kclay/rethink-scala) since it enforces type safety and provides methods for casting, blocking and async modes ,jackson for json,etc. On @deontologician note about the need for `runForCursor`. The driver is built in a way that its able to determine if the result should be a single value or an cursor. Pretty sure I can refactor some of this to work with java since some parts relying strongly on Scala implicits. Just a thought."
