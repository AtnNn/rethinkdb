      "@deontologician I wanted to add my $.02 to your question about Java 8. We have been using Java 8 for awhile now, and there are a ton of useful features. streams are very well implemented from a syntax perspective, and they have allowed us to write our code in a more functional way. We didn't have any issues converting our codebase over from Java 7."
