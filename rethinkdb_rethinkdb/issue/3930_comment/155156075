      "@mattias800 There're also [tests with usage examples](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/josh/java-driver/drivers/java/src/test/java/RethinkDBTest.java#L247) for the POJO stuff mentioned by @deontologician.\r\n\r\n@deontologician I bet @tyth would really like if we make `r.table(...)`'s signature not just `r.table(Object tableName)`, but provide a more strongly typed `r.table(ReqlExpr tableNameExpr)` among with probably more frequently used `r.table(String tableName)` which would just wrap the string with the appropriate `ReqlExpr`.\r\n\r\nI think there's no harm in doing this in means of maintainability, and it could be done anytime after 2.2 (kind of 1.0 for Java driver) is released."
