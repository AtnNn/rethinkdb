      "I'd also like to see good Scala driver support but once the low level stuff is officially supported in a Java driver I think it'd be fairly easy to write a small Scala layer on top of it with a nice DSL and maybe some additional type safety.\r\n\r\nFor the Java driver, ideally the serialization framework should be pluggable, and it'd be good if cursors implemented reactive streams so they'd easily interoperate with Play iteratees and Akka streams."
