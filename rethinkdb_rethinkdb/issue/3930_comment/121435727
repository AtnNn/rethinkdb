      "Another reason to avoid strict type checking in the driver is that the ReQL type system is quite complex, and it would be very hard to encode it in Java's type system. For example, currently `orderBy` takes an optarg for the index; the output type would depend on whether the optarg is present. Doing that sort of stuff well is really hard; we could break up `orderBy` into two functions, but that's just one of many, many examples where there is a gap between ReQL's type system and Java's."
