      "@crockpotveggies I think that the best way to filter is to use a lambda. Please have a look [at the test in this PR](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/5053/files).\r\n\r\nAs for the ways to communicate on drivers issues, it may be useful to check the official RethinkDB Slack channel. You may [sign up in a few seconds](http://slack.rethinkdb.com). There's even the `driver-dev` channel there :)"
