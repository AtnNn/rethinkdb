      "For what it's worth, you can monitor the java driver documentation on its branch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/tree/901-java-driver\r\n\r\nThe API documentation is largely done in draft but it's not fully reviewed, so some pieces of it may turn out to be horrible lies. (A lot of the stuff about changefeeds may be wrong and the cursor section definitely is, although we'll be straightening it out.)\r\n\r\nYou can also look at the comments (and discussion) on the docs issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/901\r\n\r\nThat has some useful quick overviews of Java driver quirks, notably the differences in the way the `connect` command works and the way optional arguments are passed with the `optArg` command. The API docs also talk about some Java-specific helper functions like `r.array(1, 2, 3, ...)` to create arrays and `r.hashMap(\"field1\", \"value1\").with(\"field2\", \"value2\")` to create hashmaps."
