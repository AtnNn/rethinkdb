      "Right now I'm focused on getting our tests to run to ensure the driver is complete. I'm not familiar with what's required to post it up, its on my to-do list. I would really love to do it though, if you guys who do this all the time could submit a PR or maybe just detail what I need to do to get it published so I don't have to take time out it'd be awesome.   \r\n\r\nEither way though, it's coming, I just have to do this stuff one step at a time :)"
