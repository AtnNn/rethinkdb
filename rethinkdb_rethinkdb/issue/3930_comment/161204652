      "When I ported over the **Java** driver code to **C#**, I noticed some internal data structures were not thread-safe in **C#** land. All the threading issues are resolved **C#** driver & documented in this internal design note:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver/issues/15\r\n\r\nAlthough, this design note is for C#, it might help identify thread-sensitive spots in the Java driver since both drivers share the same architecture."
