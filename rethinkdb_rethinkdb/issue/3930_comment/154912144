      "@crockpotveggies Yup, what you see in the Sonatype repo is the current snapshot of Java driver.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, there're no Javadocs now. You can have a look [at the tests](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/josh/java-driver/drivers/java/src/test/java/RethinkDBTest.java) though. I hope it helps."
