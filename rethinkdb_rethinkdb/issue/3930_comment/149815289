      "Yes I know, but if you build it with Gradle, and install the resulting JAR in your local Maven repo and try to use it in a project, you will get an exception. Add json-simple as a dependency and it will work.\r\n\r\nAlso, conn.use(dbName) doesn't work currently, you have to use r.db(dbName).table(..).\r\n\r\nNot sure if you're looking for bug reports or not, but I thought I'd mention it :)\r\n\r\nI'm really looking forward to an official release of the driver, we're looking to migrate from MySQL to RethinkDB, using Java. Is there an ETA on a release (beta or not) yet?"
