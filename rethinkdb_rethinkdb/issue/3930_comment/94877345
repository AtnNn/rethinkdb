      "@stephanos I saw you did some patches in your branch, did you get it to compile eventually? I'm not sure why it's not compiling (though I'm not surprised, I've only ever used it on one type of system for a single purpose). My guess would be an incompatible protocol buffer library or compiler.\r\n\r\nThe official driver will not be based on that code base by the way."
