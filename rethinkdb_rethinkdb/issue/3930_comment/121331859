      "@gmethvin Thanks for the suggestions.\r\n\r\nI think we'll first make sure that we ship a Java driver on par with our other official drivers and with a comparable interface that will be based on synchronous cursors.\r\nOnce we have that working reliably, I suspect that adding a reactive stream API is going to be fairly easy from what I can tell (I had only a very brief look at https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.0/README.md , so there might be some complications that I missed).\r\n\r\n@deontologician do you have additional comments on that?\r\n\r\n@gmethvin What is your use case for a pluggable serialization framework? Are you talking about the JSON encoder/decoder, the connection logic, or some higher-level API?"
