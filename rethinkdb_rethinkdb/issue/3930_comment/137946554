      "Great job @deontologician . I'm currently looking mainly to insert & watch table changes using the java driver (real-time capabilities) but did not notice how I can asynchronously watch table changes using the current driver in josh/java-driver branch. [Edited] Ok. I see, I can use Cursor for now with hasNext() - blocking & next() operations. Will try it out for now. However it would be great to have async way (from sockets) of getting the changes, hope it will be integrated into the library in future as that makes it super awesome."
