      "Actually @stephanos, what is your opinion on [the Java 7 EOL announcement](http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/05/Oracle-Ends-Java-7Public-Updates)?\r\n\r\nI assume there are lots of people still on Java 7, but I can't imagine everyone is able to switch right away. So as someone using Java 7, I'm curious whether upgrading is on your roadmap or what the feeling is towards Java 8 from professional Java developers in general"
