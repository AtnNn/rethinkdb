The following two work:\r\n```java\r\ngetAll(\"value\")\r\ngetAll(\"value\", \"primary key\")\r\n```\r\nBut the following doesn't return any results (equivalent js in Data Explorer returns results):\r\n```java\r\ngetAll(\"value\", \"secondary key\")\r\n```\r\nAre you already aware of this? Could I be doing something wrong? Should I file a bug report?"
