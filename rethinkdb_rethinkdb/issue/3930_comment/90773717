      "I think we should try to get a beta release out by 2.1, especially since we might abandon protocol buffer support with that release and @npiv's driver is still using it.\r\n\r\nLater we'll need to integrate it into our polyglot testing framework.\r\n\r\nAnother possible starting point for a driver is @dkhenry's Java driver. I've already ported it to the JSON protocol for benchmarking purposes in https://github.com/danielmewes/rethinkjava , but in contrast to @npiv's driver it's missing support for lambdas."
