      "@jyapayne Sorry we haven't made any progress on this yet. Are you still experiencing the issue?\r\nYou might also want to make sure that you're not using the same connection from multiple threads.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus Can you think of any race conditions that could happen in the Python Tornado backend? Maybe if the read of a response requires multiple reads from the socket or something like that?"
