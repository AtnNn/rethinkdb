      "This check was done to prevent `r.range().count()` and similar constructs, but it's clearly too strict. It's similar to the check being done on changefeeds, but not actually the same check.\r\n\r\nI'd argue we should simply remove it as there's multiple ways to start infinite jobs already. When #3115 is in place you should be able to simply kill them."
