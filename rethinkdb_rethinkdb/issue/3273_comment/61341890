      "This seems like a bug.  I think what we should do in the case of a `map` over multiple streams is use a normal batch (or maybe a larger-than-normal batch) rather than a `TERMINAL` batch.  That will solve this bug, and also improve performance in the case Tim mentioned.  (We should continue to error on `r.range().map(r.range(), ...)`, of course, maybe by just checking manually whether all the streams are infinite.)"
