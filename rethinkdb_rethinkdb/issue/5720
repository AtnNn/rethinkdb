        "This is a series of patches that aim to improve intra-cluster connections. This is primarily achieved by the following:\n- Introduce a `join_result_t` enum in order to return meaningful results from `connectivity_cluster_t::run_t::join_blocking`. This allows for enabling certain behaviors based on that reuslt.\n- One of those aforementioned behaviors is to stop retrying intra-cluster reconnects in the `auto_reconector_t` if a join has failed irrecoverably (a `join_result_t::PERMANENT_ERROR`) \n- Finally, a new `PERMANENT_ERROR` was introduced in the `run_t::handle` method: if an expected server id is provided, and the remote server's id does not equal that value upon initial handshake, then that will prevent further reconnects.\n\n/cc @danielmewes \n"
