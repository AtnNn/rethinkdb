      "@danielmewes [memkind](https://github.com/memkind/memkind) looks very promising for faster memory management.\r\nIt's using a customized version of jemalloc that utilizes [NUMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access). It is still beta software\r\nAMD has experimented with [a NUMA aware tcmalloc implementation](http://amd-dev.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wordpress/media/2012/10/NUMA_aware_heap_memory_manager_article_final.pdf).\r\nWe could use libnuma directly but it is not supported under windows.\r\nI'd still would like to know if any of my suggestions should lead to new issues."
