      "Hi @danielmewes sorry for the confusion. I guess I misunderstood the sentence in the [documentation](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/dates-and-times/):\r\n\r\n> Times are considered equal if their seconds since epoch (UTC) are equal, ...\r\n\r\nin a way, that milliseconds don't matter for it to be equal. This together with choosing some wrong sample data, which had only second precision made me think RethinkDB isn't considering it for sorting. \r\n\r\nSorry for the confusion and thx for the kind answer."
