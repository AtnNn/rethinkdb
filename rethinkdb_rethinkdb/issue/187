        "There are a few common problems with init.d script that would benefit from better error handling:\r\n\r\n1. If there are no instance configs, running init.d prints nothing. We should instead tell people that there are no instance configs, an preferably link them to docs that describe what to do.\r\n2. If pid file already exists, init.d prints nothing and server refuses to start. We should instead print an error message.\r\n\r\nCoupled with #156, this should make the user experience of using rethinkdb much nicer. "
