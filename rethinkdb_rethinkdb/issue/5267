        "If you try to `reconfigure` a table for which too many servers are currently missing, we return the following error: `The server(s) hosting table `test.t1` are currently unreachable. The table's configuration was not changed.`\r\n\r\nWe should add a note to the error message that suggests using `emergency_repair` if those servers are permanently missing. Maybe with the URL of the `reconfigure` API docs. \r\n\r\nThis scenario happens quite often for people who run 2 server clusters, and the `emergency_repair` option is currently hard to discover. This has lead to people not knowing what to do in at least two cases already.\r\n\r\nThe message should also mention the servers that are missing if possible."
