      "MongoDB supports something called \"tag-aware sharding\" that is very similar to this. See [this blog post](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/85721044164/tiered-storage-models-in-mongodb-optimizing-latency) and [the documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/tag-aware-sharding/).\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that there are two possible use cases for this. One is to treat different data differently; for example, a user might want to put European customers in a shard whose master is in a European data center, or they might want to put more frequently accessed data on a faster machine. The other use case is to create data locality by forcing all of the keys with a given property to be on the same shard, as seen in #911."
