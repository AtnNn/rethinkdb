      "I haven't thought through the technical implications yet, but my gut feeling is that we should support this if we can. You often want to shard on a key that isn't the primary key -- for example, location is almost certainly just a field in the document. It's way easier to shard based on a random field than to rearchitect the application to include necessary information into the primary key.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should let people specify number of hash-shards per custom-shard -- they shouldn't know or care how to do that. They should just be able to say \"I want to scale more\", add a few shards, and Rethink should add them to the relevant custom shard. The only thing a user should configure wrt custom shards IMO is the location of the data.\r\n\r\nThis might be wrong though; I'd have to think about it a bit more, study up on what the state of the art is, and discuss it with you in person to shake out the edge cases."
