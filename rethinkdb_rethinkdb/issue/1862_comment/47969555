      "Regarding enforcing uniqueness in MongoDB http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/limits/#limit-sharding-unique-indexes\r\nThey support it only if the shard key is a prefix of the index you want to be unique.\r\n\r\nSending a point get to all shards doesn't sound absolutely terrible, as long as we make users aware of it. There can be use cases where the option of sharding by a non-primary key is worth the overhead. It does rule out certain other use cases though, e.g. the case where you shard based on location to reduce latencies (since you would still have to make a round-trip to *all* involved data centers).\r\n\r\nNot enforcing uniqueness of the primary key would break a couple of things, including how we store data in the btree, and how some ReQL commands work.\r\n\r\n(Edit: removed a proposed work-around that didn't work around anything)"
