      "@no-more Indeed, I meant if #5431 was implemented, then you could configure one (or multiple) shards explicitly to contain all the \"America-*\" keys. Currently this is not directly possible.\r\n\r\n`r.uuid()` has a negligibly small chance of collision, and for practical purposes is sufficient to ensure uniquity. Furthermore RethinkDB actually checks that primary keys are unique, so in the (extremely unlikely) case that a collision is generated, the `insert` query will simply fail with a duplicate key error and you can retry it."
