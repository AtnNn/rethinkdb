      "Hello,\r\n\r\nI was looking exactly for this feature, I absolutely need to enforce the data localization per region (America, Europe...). This is a top requirement for my project, I've tried to ask for this here (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rethinkdb/HknP-wkX-Nc) before seeing this issue.\r\n\r\nOf course this might not be very easy to implement, but I really thing it's a top feature for more and more international developments.\r\n\r\nI really hope this would get implemented soon."
