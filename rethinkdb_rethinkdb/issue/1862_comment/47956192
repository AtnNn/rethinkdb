      "Do we want to support the use case in #911? To summarize, the user wants to force all of the documents with each `CustomerId` value to be in the same shard so that he can collect all of the documents with a given `CustomerId` without having to send a query to every shard. I'm inclined to think we shouldn't support this. For one thing, RethinkDB can't optimize based on custom sharding unless it understands the custom sharding function, and that seems difficult."
