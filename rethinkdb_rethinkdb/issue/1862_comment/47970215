      "MongoDB also has an alternative mode, in which the user specifies the shard key along with the primary key for a point get, and then it can send the query directly to the correct shard. Presumably, if the user gives the wrong shard key then it will say the document was not found.\r\n\r\nWe could send the query to every shard, then continue as soon as we receive the first response. Then we could have low latency in the typical case where the document is in a local data center."
