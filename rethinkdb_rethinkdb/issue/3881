        "Both the metadata and the B-tree metainfo have changed format with the Raft changes. We need to write code to migrate existing data files in-place to the new format. There are several parts to this:\n- Metadata migration: When a post-Raft server opens a pre-Raft metadata file, it should create a Raft cluster for each table that it was a replica for before. This means that every replica will create its own Raft cluster; but the epoch system will pick a winner. We should think more about this and make sure it actually gives reasonable behavior.\n- Metainfo migration: The metainfo now stores `version_t` instead of `version_range_t`. Normally the old `version_range_t`s corresponded to a single `version_t`, so they're easy to translate. If the start and end points of the range are different, we need to create a fake branch and insert it into the local branch history.\n- Sindex metadata migration: If we decide to put secondary indexes in the Raft metadata, we need a way to put them there. We might be able to insert them as we create the new Raft cluster when migrating the metadata.\n"
