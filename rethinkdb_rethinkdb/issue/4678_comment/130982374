      "> Sorry again that your first experience putting us into production was so rocky. \r\n> Hopefully we can get these things sorted out pretty soon.\r\n\r\nThanks.   RethinkDB 2.0.4 is working *extremely* well regarding efficiency and solving my problems.  I'm running it live in production right now at https://cloud.sagemath.com, and I'm very happy with how it is working.  Once I get load simulated, I'll push hard to get 2.1 (or whatever) tested and we'll get to the bottom of things.  You guys are great!"
