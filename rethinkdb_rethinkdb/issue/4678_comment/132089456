      "I'm using Javascript (with rethinkdbdash, but I think that shouldn't matter for building the query).   When I use the includeInitialVals option, I get\r\n\r\n    Uncaught exception: ReqlDriverError: Unrecognized option `includeInitialVals` in `changes` after:\r\n    ...\r\n    Available options are squash <bool>\r\n\r\nThat option isn't documented here, so I don't know if there is a typo: http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/changes/\r\nAlso, the \"Available options\" error message isn't right, since it only includes squash, thus omitting the documented includeStates option. \r\n\r\nI also tried passing the option to run and get this error:\r\n\r\n    { [ReqlDriverError: Unrecognized option `includeInitialVals` in `run`. Available options are readMode <string>, durability <string>, noreply <bool>, timeFormat <string>, grou\r\npFormat: <string>, profile <bool>, binaryFormat <string>, cursor <bool>, stream <bool>.]\r\n\r\nI'm using the RethinkDB 2.1 dpkg that Michael emailed to me.   And I'm sorry again if rethinkdbdash is somehow relevant to this.\r\n\r\nI've figured out how to fully stress test a testing setup, so I can now easily test anything..."
