      "Thanks for checking.  I can modify the source code of rethinkdbdash as well.  (But I won't be able to work on this until later.)   I've also been working on writing a monkey patch of the run method of the official javascript rethinkdb driver which gives it the same semantics as the rethinkdbdash run command, so that I can flip a switch and test with either rethinkdbdash or the official driver without having to change any of my other code.
