      "@williamstein -- we can definitely put together a version of 2.0 with the same patch.  We can probably get it to you tomorrow.\r\n\r\nIt's surprising that 2.0 and 2.1 are behaving so differently on your workload.  I wonder if it's an unrelated regression.\r\n\r\nSorry again that your first experience putting us into production was so rocky.  Hopefully we can get these things sorted out pretty soon."
