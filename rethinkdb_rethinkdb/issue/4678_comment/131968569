      "Thanks.  I will test soon with that option to disable initial vals in production with 2.1.x, now that I'm good at switching back and forth.  (I settled on switching by setting up a separate 2.1.x machine, then rsyncing the live data from 2.0.4 repeatedly, then shutting down the 2.0.4 server, then doing a final rsync, then starting the 2.1.x server on that data, then finally rebuild indexes manually.  I end up with about 1 min downtime by doing this, as opposed to using \"rethinkdb dump/restore\", which can take 15-20 minutes with my data.)\r\n\r\nI can also happily report that RethinkDB 2.0.4 has *stopped* crashing for me in production (with the above backtrace) when I used the slightly updated binary you guys emailed me.  THANKS. "
