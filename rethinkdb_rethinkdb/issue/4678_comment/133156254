      "There's a race condition in combination with changefeeds that's consistent with the observed segmentation fault crash. I'm currently testing a fix for that. The race condition can only happen while a table is being reconfigured, so this should be rare in normal operation.\r\n\r\nAn open question is whether this is the same problem as the seg faults in #4675. One report there was describing the crash as happening while deleting a database with tables in it, which would be consistent with this, but the other report doesn't mention any reconfiguration."
