      "@williamstein I'm really really sorry for the huge amount of trouble you had to go through until you got it working. 2.1.0 ended up being much less stable than we had anticipated after our internal testing. The good news is that your feedback helped us a lot in fixing various issues, so we'll end up with a much better software once we ship the next point release."
