      "It looks like the [documentation](https://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/wait/) is incorrect on the `wait` method here, this code works as expected:\r\n`r.db('mydb').table('mytable').wait({waitFor: 'ready_for_writes'});`\r\n\r\nSo, I would assume the default is actually `all_replicas_ready` rather than `ready_for_writes`"
