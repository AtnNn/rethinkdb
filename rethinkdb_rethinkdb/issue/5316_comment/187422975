      "@mbroadst `ready_for_writes` doesn't wait until the configuration has actually finished applying.\r\nIf all you want is run a query and you handle query failures in terms of calling `wait` again and then retrying the query `ready_for_writes` is sufficient.\r\n\r\nHowever since the configuration has not necessarily been fully applied when `wait(wait_for=\"ready_for_writes\")` returns, the table might subsequently become unavailable again (e.g. when the primary switches over from the old to the new primary)."
