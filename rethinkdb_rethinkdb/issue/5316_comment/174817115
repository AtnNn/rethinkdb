      "You're right! Sorry for the confusion.\r\nAlso thank you for tracking this down in the code. I was under the impression that we defaulted this to `ready_for_writes`, but obviously we didn't (or somehow that change got lost).\r\n\r\nI think we should change the implementation to match the documentation. It makes the term slightly weaker by default, but on the other hand the weaker guarantee is all that we've ever guaranteed in the documentation."
