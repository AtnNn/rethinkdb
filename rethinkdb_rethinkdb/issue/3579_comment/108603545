      "I think that all types of changefeeds should either default to returning initial changes, or not. The mixed behavior that we seem to be adopting is confusing. I see the logic in where the defaults are, and especially in having `table` changefeeds not default to sending the entire table, but I don't think that the convenience of trying to match the defaults to the normal use case is worth having the (potentially)  seemingly random differences in behavior between types of changefeeds."
