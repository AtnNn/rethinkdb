      "I can definitely see where you're coming from, but I disagree with the conclusion (that we should standardize on one default). It feels like:\r\n\r\n- Defaulting to `true` on queries like `r.table('foo').changes()` is obviously bad because it makes this query useless by default in 95% of scenarios\r\n- Defaulting to `false` on queries like `r.table('foo').orderBy(index='bar').limit(5)` is obviously bad because it makes this query useless by default in 95% of scenarios\r\n- Having different defaults in different cases is obviously bad because inconsistency is confusing\r\n\r\nGiven that we're picking between different evils, I think we should go the pragmatic route (different defaults in different cases, accept the inconsistency) and document it really well. But I can definitely see why people are unhappy with that behavior. I'm unhappy with it too, just less unhappy than the alternatives."
