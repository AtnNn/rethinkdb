      "Sorry to drag on the discussion for forever, but what do people think about a really short one like `init`?  So `r.table('test').changes(init: true)` instead of `r.table('test').changes(include_initial_vals: true)`.\r\n\r\nIf people don't like a short one, I think `include_initial_vals` is the best of the long ones."
