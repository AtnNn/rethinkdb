        "With the move of the `interface` tests from `./test/run` to `./test/rql_test/test-runner` (#5619) the way we run the `interface/artificial_table` test works. Right now it is called by `test-runner`, and then itself starts another instance of `test-runner`. This is just so we can specify that a list of tests run with a specific table (`rethinkdb._debug_scratch`). There has to be a better way of doing this.\n"
