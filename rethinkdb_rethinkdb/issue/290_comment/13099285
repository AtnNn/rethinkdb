      "I'd like to know what the join parameters are that you give each rethinkdb instance at startup.  Each node should be told about every other node in the cluster, or it can take some time for full connectivity to be established.\r\n\r\nThere was a bug regarding cluster connectivity that I fixed in #170, so that should be in for the 1.4 release, and it could be what you're experiencing here, although it's hard to tell because I don't know how these instances are joining each other."
