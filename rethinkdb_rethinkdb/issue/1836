        "I have a table with 4 shards and 2 replicas on a cluster of 4 severs. Looking at the \"Servers used by this table\" section of the table page on the web UI, I see the exact same number of approximate documents for each server. This number shown seems to be the total number of documents in the table, not the number of documents on each individual server. Each server in this scenario should have roughly half of the table's documents.\r\n\r\n![approximate documents](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/505365/1882773/dedb9a40-797a-11e3-9e00-568d021e79a2.png)\r\n"
