      "Moving to subsequent, we'll try to think this through. This is somewhat related to #1375.\r\n\r\nWe could poll physical RAM and start rejecting queries with an out of memory error/warning when it goes into dangerous territory. This is generally hard to do because there is no way to poll the OS for when the OOM killer will kick in -- it can sometimes snipe the process in unexpected conditions. But we could probably find a good-enough heuristic that makes the experience nicer for users."
