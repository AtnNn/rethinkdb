        "### Steps to repro\r\n1. require two different instances of the rethinkdb js driver\r\n2. connect to a db with one of the drivers\r\n3. run a query from the other driver, but pass in the connection from the first driver\r\n\r\n### What happens\r\nAn invalid connection error\r\n\r\n### What should happen\r\nNo error should be thrown.\r\n\r\nI suspect that part of the check uses `instanceof` to determine if the passed object is a connection. Unfortunately, that treats rethinkdb as a singleton, which isn't necessary and causes the breakage described here. "
