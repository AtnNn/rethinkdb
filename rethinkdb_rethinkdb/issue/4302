        "### Steps to repro\n1. require two different instances of the rethinkdb js driver\n2. connect to a db with one of the drivers\n3. run a query from the other driver, but pass in the connection from the first driver\n### What happens\n\nAn invalid connection error\n### What should happen\n\nNo error should be thrown.\n\nI suspect that part of the check uses `instanceof` to determine if the passed object is a connection. Unfortunately, that treats rethinkdb as a singleton, which isn't necessary and causes the breakage described here. \n"
