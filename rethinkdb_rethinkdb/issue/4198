        "Currently a number of the EventEmitter sub-tests in `feeds.mocha` have a 200ms timeout to wait until all events have been delivered. In most cases they are done long before that, even on slow systems. A better way of handling this would be to cycle looking for the right answer, and once found end the test.\r\n\r\nThis is a low priority enhancement, and just here so I don't forget it."
