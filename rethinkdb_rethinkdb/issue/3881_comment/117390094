      "Some complications (relevant for @Tryneus):\r\n\r\n* In RethinkDB 2.0, if a server is permanently removed, we'll leave its server ID in the configs. All of the functions for displaying servers in 2.0 will check each server ID in the config, and ignore the ones that have been permanently removed. So the migration routine needs to do the same thing.\r\n\r\n* The primary for a shard in 2.0 can also be set to the server ID of a permanently removed server, or it can be set to a nil UUID. But in 2.1 the primary must be a valid server ID. So the migration process should detect the case where the primary server ID is a permanently removed server or nil, and pick an arbitrary secondary to become primary."
