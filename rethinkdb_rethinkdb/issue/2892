        "Hi there,\n\nHere's a useful and simple feature that could be added to the clients - that is - to overload getAll command so that it could also take in ID's as a single array, not only as multiple params.\n\nAn example use would be:\n\n``` javascript\nr.table('dc').getAll(['superman', 'ant man']).run(conn, callback)\n```\n\nAs an addition to the currently available:\n\n``` javascript\nr.table('dc').getAll('superman', 'ant man').run(conn, callback)\n```\n\nWhy?\nA use case would be to simplify certain queries. \nRight now, I have to write a query with 2nd-level lambda nesting to get the desired effect:\n\n``` javascript\nr.table('data').merge(function(obj){ \n                            var retVal = obj('projects').map(function(row) {\n                                return r.table('data-1234').get(row)('name')\n                            });\n                            return r.object('projects', retVal );\n});\n```\n\n(this serves to simply replace the array of project ID's with an array of their respective names from another table)\n\nIf this were implemented, I could simply write:\n\n``` javascript\nr.table('data').merge(function(obj){ \n   return r.object('projects', r.table('data-1234')).getAll(obj('projects')).pluck('name').coerceTo('array'));\n});\n```\n\nCheers!\n"
