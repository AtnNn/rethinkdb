      "@anatol yes. @RubenKelevra you can simply remove the line `pid-file=/var/run/rethinkdb/default.pid` from your config file. Looks like it's not needed.\r\nNote that RethinkDB uses `flock` on the data directory anyway to make sure no two instances are using the same data. This works independently of the pid file."
