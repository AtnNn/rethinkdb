      "@RubenKelevra Do you use Arch with its systemd unit file?\r\n\r\nI believe just manually removing the pid file should fix the problem.\r\n\r\nBut it is a good idea if this file got removed automatically in case of rethinkdb process crash. See if adding `PIDFile=/var/run/rethinkdb/%i.pid` to the unit file helps with it."
