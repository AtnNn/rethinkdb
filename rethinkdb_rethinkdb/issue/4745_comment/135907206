      "Ok after looking at our code it seems like - as far as the server itself is concerned - we indeed just check if the pid file exists and fail if it does.\r\n\r\nIn our init script we verify if the process ID from the pid file still exists, and if not we delete the file. We should probably move that logic into the server itself, so it can work with other startup scripts.\r\n\r\n@AtnNn have you done any work in that direction as part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3450 ?\r\n\r\n"
