      "Unless I am really misreading something, this is because you are trying to use the JavaScript driver directly in your browser. This is a common mistake (I opened rethinkdb/docs#1132 to put it in our FAQ), rather the JavaScript driver is made to work from [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). There are a number of reasons for this, but the primary one is that client-side is the wrong place to put code that enforces things like security. So there needs to be a server component.\r\n\r\nI also will mention that we have recently unveiled [Horizon](http://horizon.io), which tries to take most of the work of setting up that back-end over from you until you need something more complicated, at which point you can transition to your own server-side code a piece at time.\r\n\r\nI am going to close this as not-a-bug, but feel free to ask more questions in this issue."
