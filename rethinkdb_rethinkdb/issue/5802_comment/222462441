      "Hi @larkost ,\r\nThanks for your response, I think you're right. I am making some mistake with the rethink drivers.\r\nI am using webpack as the bundler. And the entry folder contains the rethink driver files also. Do you think this is causing the issue. May be it is trying to bundle the driver's code too. What do you suggest?"
