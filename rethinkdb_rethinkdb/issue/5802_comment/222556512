      "@nitte93 I don't think the issue is webpack, but the fact that you're running the code in your browser and not in node.js. Please correct me if I'm wrong though.\r\n\r\nAs @larkost said: The RethinkDB JavaScript driver must be run in node.js on the backend. You can't use it directly in your frontend / browser code. http://horizon.io might be what you're looking for."
