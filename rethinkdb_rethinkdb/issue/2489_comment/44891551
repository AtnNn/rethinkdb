      "Still working on creating a repro case for y'all.\r\n\r\nIt only seems to crash with multiple inserts to multiple different tables. While running my export script, I can get it to crash 100% of the time and it switches randomly between the two errors above (either segfault or guarantee failed), but it crashes at random different points in the script.\r\n\r\nTrying to log the inserts I am doing and then replaying them outside of the export script doesn't seem to produce a crash.\r\n\r\nI think it may have to do with the random timing of the inserts -- there are gaps of time where we are fetching data from postgres to massage and insert into rethink. Perhaps that's when something like GC would kick in?"
