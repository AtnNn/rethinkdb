        "Currently, even if you chain `.coerceTo('array')` on the end of your query, the Data Explorer will limit the number of results displayed at once. It should be possible to force the Data Explorer to render all results by coercing the stream to an array.\n\nThis is necessary for doing one-off exports of data. I believe there's an issue somewhere for downloading Data Explorer results as JSON, which would be an even better solution, but I can't find it.\n"
