      "I have updated the comment above.  Making buf_lock_t construction not force page loading in snapshots is now in next.  That was the hard change to make.  Specifying smaller serializer buf sizes is a pretty small and simple change, waiting on reviews 1312 and 1314.\r\n\r\nNext is supporting simultaneous index_write calls, so that they can be merged, and such."
