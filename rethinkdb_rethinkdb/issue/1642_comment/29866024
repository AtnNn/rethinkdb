      "I have changed things such that creating a table seems to complete successfully all the time.\r\n\r\nThe problem observed after planting debugfs everywhere was that the page_txn_t destructor was sometimes hanging saying that flushing was not completed.\r\n\r\nThis problem went away when I commented out the use of the merger serializer in file_based_svs_by_namespace.cc.\r\n\r\nIt might be the case now that everything is working correctly or it might be the case that there's something technically wrong with the way the page cache is talking to the serializer or it might be a problem with the merger serializer.  I will investigate this further..."
