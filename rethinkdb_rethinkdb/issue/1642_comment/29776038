      "An update:  Some problems with the way the alt cache was integrated have been fixed, those that made the RDBBtree.* tests hang.  The RDBProtocolBackfill.* tests either take too long or fail.\r\n\r\nWhen running the actual server, creating a table usually doesn't complete and wait_for_rdb_table_readiness spins claiming that the master is inaccessible.  Usually this happens without any store_view_t methods hanging.  I don't know yet what that problem is.  Creating a table is more likely to work successfully if you lower the CPU_SHARD_FACTOR from 4 to 1."
