      "The branch sam_alt has been merged to next.  It is sprinkled with LSI and KSI comments.  The LSI comments are mandatory tasks (or wrong).\r\n\r\nHere's what's next:\r\n\r\n- Move some stuff out of page.hpp and page.cc, into separate files.\r\n\r\n- User-specified cache priorities should be actually used, not ignored.\r\n\r\n- Make it so that when the user specifies a smaller block size, a smaller block gets flushed to disk.\r\n\r\n- Add reasonable perfmon variables.\r\n\r\nAlso requested by @danielmewes (but maybe technically out of the scope of this issue):\r\n\r\n- Allow maybe 2 or 3 simultaneous index_write calls to be dispatched instead of just 1.\r\n\r\n"
