      "Currently simultaneous index_write calls is implemented and awaiting code review (after some iterations).\r\n\r\nI will make a separate issue tracking the problem of having block writes be a bit more combined since that is why benchmarks have gone from 7k in v1.11.x to 5k.\r\n\r\nI am currently working on fixing the \"RSP\" comments, replacing std::vectors with segmented_vector_t's and such.  Much of that is awaiting code review.  Some is not."
