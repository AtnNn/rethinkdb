      "A bug where the alt cache was accessing its eviction bags from the serializer thread has been fixed and right now I don't know of any bugs (besides incomplete features).  It fails the same set of rql tests that next fails, except sometimes it also gives a few errors where a secondary index was accessed before its construction was finished.  Those errors seem to be not-a-bug -- the secondary index might be slow in being reconstructed due to incomplete features of the cache (such as the fact that every read transaction still performs an empty index write).  The reql tests which fail (and which fail in next) are regression-46-2-CPP and regression-370-3-CPP."
