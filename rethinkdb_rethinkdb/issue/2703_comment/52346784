      "@bigtree3131 Interesting. Thank you for the update. It explains the failed i/o, but it's very unlikely that it was responsible for the out of memory problem.\r\nWe have just fixed two issues (#2899 and #2840) that could lead to out of memory conditions. The fixes will ship in the next days with the 1.13.4 release.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue, but please re-open it if you see out of memory issues or other crashes again after 1.13.4."
