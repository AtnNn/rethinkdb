      "@bigtree3131 Since you got the error code EIO (\"Input/output error.\"), this sounds like a hardware problem or a filesystem problem.  I would recommend running fsck on the file system and also using /sbin/badblocks to see if there's any obvious problems there -- squirrelly SSD firmware probably won't get tripped up by badblocks though.  If the crash is reproducible on one node but not others (assuming the workload is fair to all nodes) I would recommend replacing the SSDs (or one of the SSDs at a time) on that node.\r\n\r\nIf the EIO error reproduces on any node, and if the SSDs are either from a reliable brand or different brands, that would suggest a bug in ext4 code or some other part of the kernel (and you could try switching to some other file system).  If it can't be reproduced at all, we won't be able to figure out whether it's the file system or some SSD.\r\n\r\nThe fix that we would try to make, if it's the ext4 file system or kernel at fault, is to work around whatever bug it has."
