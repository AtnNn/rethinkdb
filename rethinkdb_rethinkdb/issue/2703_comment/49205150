      "@coffeemug -- no worries \r\n\r\n-- we have an 8 node cluster, and each node has 2x200GB SSD RAID 0, Ext4 for rethinkdb data\r\n-- the drive had roughly 90% free space when the node crashed\r\n-- the error is intermittent...I've probably encountered it 3 times and each time it is during a heavy write load...i.e building multiple databases at the same time... during this most recent crash, I was running rethinkdb dump, with --clients 16, while adding a few secondary indexes...this is the only time that it has happened with secondary indexes...the others were just during heavy writes."
