      "@bigtree3131 Thank you for the bug report. For the time being, you can try running RethinkDB with the `--no-direct-io` flag (or add `no-direct-io` to the configuration file). Performance might degrade slightly, but this flag has worked to avoid some system-specific i/o related issues in the past."
