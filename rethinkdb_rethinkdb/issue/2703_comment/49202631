      "@bigtree3131 -- sorry you ran into this and thanks for the bug report. We'll get to the bottom of this ASAP. A couple of questions:\r\n\r\n- Which file system are you using to back the rethinkdb data directory?\r\n- How much free disk space do you have on that file system for the machine in question?\r\n- Is the error easily reproducible or intermittent?"
