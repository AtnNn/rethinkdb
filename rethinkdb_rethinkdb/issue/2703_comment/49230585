      "@bigtree3131 Thank you for the `uname -a` output!\r\n\r\nI think I didn't describe well what I wanted with respect to `mount`. Can you just run the `mount` command without any argument? It will print a list of mounted partitions together with their mount options. You can post the whole output, or just the line for the partition that contains your RethinkDB data. I'm interested in the mount options for that partition."
