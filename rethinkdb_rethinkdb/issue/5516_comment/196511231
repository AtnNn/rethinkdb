      "We'll need to check to which degree XA can be applied to RethinkDB. The spec is available here http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009680699/toc.pdf . I haven't fully read it yet.\r\n\r\nI find the idea very interesting though.\r\n\r\nDo you know if local transactions are a pre-requirement for implementing XA support? (see also: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4598 )"
