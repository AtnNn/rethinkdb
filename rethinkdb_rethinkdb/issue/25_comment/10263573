      "@ptrln -- this is by design, it's a way to use 'cursors' in node. If the callback returns true, it gets called again with the next record. If it returns nothing/false, it doesn't get called again (rethink assumes you don't want the rest of the records). An alternative is to call 'collect' instead of run, which will give you the whole dataset.\r\n\r\n@wmrowan -- could you please improve the docs on this, and add 'collect' to the js docs?"
