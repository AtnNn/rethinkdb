      "Behavior A is expected. We don't let people change pkeys, they have to delete and reinsert the document instead. (We can open a specific proposal to add nondeterministic behavior to a replace like that, but it would be an enhancement, not a fix).\r\n\r\nI also agree that B and C are errors. (Well, B is actually ok, but I don't see how we could fix C without throwing an error on B, and C is clearly an error)\r\n\r\n"
