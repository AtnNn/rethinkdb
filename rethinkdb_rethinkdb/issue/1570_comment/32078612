      "Alright, I'll revert us to the old behavior.\r\n\r\n@robert-zaremba -- the basic rule is that if there's a problem before we try to perform any writes, we throw an error, and if there's a problem while performing one of the writes we add it to the response object.  (We do it this way because it really sucks to have a big update aborted partway through because one row was missing a field.)"
