        "I know a couple of these may sounds like heresy or at least mutiny, but the more I've been using DataExplorer the more annoyed I got about its automatic popup. I had to report these though:\r\n\r\n1. it popups up immediately on some key characters/positions.\r\n\r\n    The behavior in IDEs is that the suggester shows up on 2 cases: a slight delay after there's no keyboard activity or triggered by a use shortcut.\r\n\r\n2. it covers my code ( _nb_ I wouldn't be annoyed if I'd be the one triggering its display, but combining it automatic popup with this effect results in an annoying feeling)\r\n\r\n3. the structure, spacing and coloring of the docs in the suggester are hardly legible. \r\n\r\n( _now I feel a bit better_ :sweat_smile: )"
