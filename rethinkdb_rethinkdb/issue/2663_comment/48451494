      "After talking to @timmaxw last night, I'd like to amend my previous proposal in the following ways:\r\n\r\n- I am ok with a single higher-level API function with various optargs to do high-level cluster operations. I now agree that the chaining syntax I proposed is sloppy and stupid. I still think it should have side effects and a dry run optarg, and last we spoke I believe Tim agrees with that now.\r\n- I still think we should use `r.db('system').table('clustering')` for system tables, and I believe Tim agrees with that (though he suggested using the name `rethinkdb` instead of `system`).\r\n- I now think dropping low level API commands and having people write to the config document directly is a good idea. We can always add more commands if it makes sense later.\r\n- We should think about the format of the config document very carefully and make sure it's easy to understand and modify (since for detailed low-level configuration it *is* the API)\r\n\r\n> Can we have something that suggests how many shards a table needs\r\n\r\nIf we have one higher-level function with optargs to set things (pretend it's called `distribute(...)` for now), one way to achieve this would be to call it with no arguments at all (or may be with dry run set to true). It would be pretty cool to make this happen, though I think it's quite far away.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that people have said before \"I want a way for RethinkDB to just use all the machines I give it, I don't want to have to think about the number of shards\". For the first pass calling `distribute()` with no arguments might do something like that via some set of reasonable heuristics. That would be a pretty nice bonus!"
