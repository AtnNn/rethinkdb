      "To clarify the gist of the proposal, I think the higher level API shouldn't store any state, and we should never store state based on tags (other than the tags themselves). I think this dramatically simplifies the API (both from the user's POV, and the implementation itself). It also removes all kinds of weird edge cases (e.g. what if the user said X in the higher level API and later said Y in the lower level API -- how do we reconcile the two?) which were a large source of complexity and confusion in the existing system.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that users can't get back and manipulate higher level state without respecifying it from scratch, but I think that's an acceptable tradeoff. It makes things really simple and still lets people accomplish everything they want."
