      "- Are the servers passed in `shard` for selecting primaries and failover?\r\n\r\nDoes this query means that server1 is the primary for the first shard, and machine2 will be the master if server1 fails?\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"foo\").shard(2,[ [\"server1\", \"server2\"], [\"server3\", \"server4\"]])\r\n```\r\nAlso if we set these failover servers, does it mean we automatically set a secondary and an ack on them?\r\n\r\n- Isn't pinning a shard to a server a pretty advanced feature? We dropped this feature from the web interface because it was too complicated.\r\nShouldn't we just set primaries/secondaries with datancenters (or tags)?\r\n\r\n- I also briedfly talked with @coffeemug about that, but can we decide what we want an ack to be for? When we create a new secondary, should we automatically add an ack?\r\nShould we force an ack to be on a certain server? Which would to some extend simulate https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2119\r\nOr should we automatically max out the value for ack? And not show it on the high level API?\r\nAnd also what is a replica for? Is the master going to send forward queries in a round-robin fashion like it used to? Or is it solely for the purpose of having a backup?"
