      "I was apparently wrong about durability -- we support it per-query but never took it out in the config. In any case, here is what I think we should do:\r\n\r\n- Take durability and acks out of cluster config.\r\n- Support asks per query and durability per query (that's already true).\r\n- If people want the settings, we can add them back later. But I don't think they should be in the cluster config document. It sounds like they belong somewhere else (same place where we'd expose, say, which field is the primary key for a given table)."
