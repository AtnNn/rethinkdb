      "> I propose that we don't support it in the ReQL API, but we support it in the web UI through a private web-UI-only API.\r\n\r\nI don't think we need to do that. I think we can structure the web ui in a way where you merely have to say \"there is a conflict, please reconfigure\" and call it a day."
