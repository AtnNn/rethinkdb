      "So I think we're mostly in agreement about the lower-level API, though there is still some debate about the higher-level reconfiguration API. Given that these are independent, I'd like to split this in two separate issues (a low-level API proposal and a high-level API proposal). We can then settle the low-level API proposal quickly and start work on it ASAP, and think through the high level API proposal in parallel. @timmaxw -- are you ok with that?\r\n\r\nAssuming that we agree on dropping acks from the table config schema, I can write up the low-level API proposal (which is mostly what's already agreed upon here, I'll just write a precise spec)."
