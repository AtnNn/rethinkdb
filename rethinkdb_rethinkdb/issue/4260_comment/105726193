      "@thelinuxlich Thanks for chiming in. If most users of the driver also expect this, perhaps we should include it despite my misgivings.\r\n\r\n@marshall007 Thanks, you've summarized my opinion well.\r\n\r\nIn your code, the `x` variable is clearly defined, but the error message says it isn't. Therein lies the essence of my gripe.\r\n\r\nI do however think it's great that it makes it easier for an IDE to indent and highlight the function. I would personally prefer code that explicitly uses `(function(...){...}).toString()`."
