      "If I read this right, you are trying to test a modified JavaScript driver in a fork of our git repository using your installed version of the `rethinkdb` server binary. Assuming that I am readying this right, then the solution is to run this command[1]:\r\n```\r\n./test/rql_test/test-runner --server-binary /usr/bin/rethinkdb --interpreter js\r\n```\r\nThat does assume that you are typing it from the root of our git repository. You don't have to be there, as the testing framework is pretty robust about that.\r\n\r\nThere is also an option to run against an already-running server, but I would recommend against it for driver testing like this (in fact I would recommend against it for most cases)."
