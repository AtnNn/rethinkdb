      "I think I agree with @AtnNn and @timmaxw .  When I see `r.js('(function(){return x;})')`, it's clear to me that `x` is being sent verbatim and not resolved locally.  When I see `r.js(function(){return x;})` I would **strongly** expect `x` to be resolved locally, because it isn't in a string and every other time you pass a function to a ReQL term that's how it behaves."
