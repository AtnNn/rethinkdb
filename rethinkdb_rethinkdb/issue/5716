        "I am attempting to create a polygon with more than one hole. There does not appear to be any mechanism to do this via `polygonSub`, since `polygonSub` cannot be called on the result of a `polygonSub`. For example:\n\n```\nr.polygon([-83.292,42.441],[-82.939,42.454],[-82.906,42.418],[-83.162,42.251],[-83.292,42.441])\n.polygonSub(r.polygon([-83.115,42.414],[-83.101,42.393],[-83.08,42.401],[-83.091,42.414],[-83.115,42.414]))\n.polygonSub(r.polygon([-83.07,42.4],[-83.053,42.384],[-83.047,42.387],[-83.046,42.4],[-83.07,42.4]))\n```\n\nproduces the server error:\n\n```\ne: Expected a Polygon with only an outer shell.  This one has holes in:\nr.polygon([-83.292, 42.441], [-82.939, 42.454], [-82.906, 42.418], [-83.162, 42.251], [-83.292, 42.441]).polygonSub(r.polygon([-83.115, 42.414], [-83.101, 42.393], [-83.08, 42.401], [-83.091, 42.414], [-83.115, 42.414])).polygonSub(r.polygon([-83.07, 42.4], [-83.053, 42.384], [-83.047, 42.387], [-83.046, 42.4], [-83.07, 42.4]))\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       \n```\n\nHowever, the server does seem to support this case, and a polygon with multiple holes can be created via the `geojson` command. An example using the same coordinates as above:\n\n```\nr.geojson({'type': 'Polygon', 'coordinates': [\n[[-83.292,42.441],[-82.939,42.454],[-82.906,42.418],[-83.162,42.251],[-83.292,42.441]],\n[[-83.115,42.414],[-83.101,42.393],[-83.08,42.401],[-83.091,42.414],[-83.115,42.414]],\n[[-83.07,42.4],[-83.053,42.384],[-83.047,42.387],[-83.046,42.4],[-83.07,42.4]]]})\n```\n"
