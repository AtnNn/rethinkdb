      "Sorry for being a bit sarcastic: so there won't be a warning (which would be ~15 minutes of work), because the cache size will \"soon\" be configurable (which would be ~5 hours of work), which is not actually done either (see #908), because the cache quota system will \"very soon\" be reworked (which would be ~5 days of work).\r\n\r\nYet #97 has been open for 8 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: coffeemug <notifications@github.com>\r\nDate: Tue, 09 Jul 2013 15:13:22 \r\nTo: rethinkdb/rethinkdb<rethinkdb@noreply.github.com>\r\nReply-To: rethinkdb/rethinkdb <reply@reply.github.com>\r\nCc: Daniel Mewes<danielmewes@onlinehome.de>\r\nSubject: Re: [rethinkdb] Add a warning to `rethinkdb dump` about indexes and\r\n cluster config (#1137)\r\n\r\nWe'll fix the cache issue soon. Also, now that one could do durability on a per-command basis, I think per-table durability setting is somewhat moot (I'd even consider taking it out, but since it's work, we can just leave it).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1137#issuecomment-20709398\r\n\r\n"
