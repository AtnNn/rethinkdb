      "Hmm, I was under the impression that import also created tables.\r\n\r\nIf that is not the case, then never mind. If it is, then I think that it should remind you that you better create your tables manually before running import if you care about availability and/or performance of your db.\r\n\r\nI agree that durability and cache sizes should be set by the user. But unfortunately that is currently not possible. And because the user cannot even check these things (at least cache size) anywhere, as they don't show up in info, they wouldn't even have a chance to notice that something hasn't been restored until it might be too late.\r\nHence the (temporary) need for a warning on import.\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Tryneus <notifications@github.com>\r\nDate: Tue, 09 Jul 2013 13:54:35 \r\nTo: rethinkdb/rethinkdb<rethinkdb@noreply.github.com>\r\nReply-To: rethinkdb/rethinkdb <reply@reply.github.com>\r\nCc: Daniel Mewes<danielmewes@onlinehome.de>\r\nSubject: Re: [rethinkdb] Add a warning to `rethinkdb dump` about indexes and\r\n cluster config (#1137)\r\n\r\nI don't think we should modify things like cache size or durability (even if we could get it from an existing table with `table.info()`), because that should be set by the users.  Import should only be concerned with the data, not the configuration.\r\n\r\nAs for the warning, how would you word it to clarify?  To me, cache size and durability *are* cluster metadata.\r\n\r\n---\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1137#issuecomment-20704626\r\n\r\n"
