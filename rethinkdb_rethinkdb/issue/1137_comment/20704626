      "I don't think we should modify things like cache size or durability (even if we could get it from an existing table with `table.info()`), because that should be set by the users.  Import should only be concerned with the data, not the configuration.\r\n\r\nAs for the warning, how would you word it to clarify?  To me, cache size and durability *are* cluster metadata."
