      "Oh, I actually loved your \"Basically, yes\" answer. It was totally Slava-ish ;-)\r\n\r\nI also realize that my comment was a bit on the edge to being rude. I realize of course that everybody is working very hard to make RethinkDB the best product possible. As a consequence, working on a certain issue can only be done at the expense of other issues. So I hope I didn't make the impression that I was complaining about certain things (caching) not having been done yet.\r\n\r\nMy point was more that it sometimes makes sense to waste a little bit of time on something that will become obsolete later (here: adding detail to the warning message), if the point where it will become obsolete is - realistically - not going to come as soon as might be expected. To be frank, I have doubts that the proper cache quota system will make it into 1.8. It appears like a very complex task, with lots of decisions to make, heuristics to decide upon and many trade-offs between CPU performance and cache efficiency. That's just my impression of course, and I can hopefully be proven wrong. The reconfigurable cache quota on the other hand gives people the *chance* to react to memory issues that come up, even if they don't know how to tune it right from the start, which is why I like it. But this is the wrong place for debating that, and I guess the decision has been made anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat you are writing makes total sense."
