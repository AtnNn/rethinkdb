      "Ah, I didn't think about the let.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we can't do the latter (at least not consistently), because in JS the `()` operator is `getattr`.\r\n\r\nI like the `call`, though I still think we should define `json:js` on all clients so it can be accessed similarly to all other json functions."
