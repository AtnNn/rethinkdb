      "So I'm a bit confused about how js works. Can we actually pass a functions in? I thought it was only expressions So for example can I do:\r\n\r\n    table.map(r.js(\"function (x) { return x + 1; }\")\r\n\r\nDoing that makes sense to me but I don't think any of this makes sense if it's only expressions."
