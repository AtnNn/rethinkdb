      "I'm with @mlucy, why do we need to have a distinction? Presently, a write query can appear anywhere. You can even do this `r.expr([table.insert(...), table.insert(...)]) => [{'inserted':1}, {'inserted':1}]` thus the only distinction between `for_each` and `map` (or even make array) is the \"stats merge\" that reduces all those \"inserted\" messages.\r\n\r\nThis is simple, elegant, and flexible. Why would we force a distinction when there doesn't need to be one?"
