      "I was looking at the reactor_driver in a different context and noticed that we do have a `delete_reactor_data()` function which should actually delete the table file (by calling `destroy_svs()`).\r\n\r\nSo it seems that we are just not calling it properly, at least in some cases.\r\n\r\nPS: I think we might only be calling it when the whole table is deleted, but not if a node loses its role as a replica."
