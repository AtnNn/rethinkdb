      "well there are a few things i can see. If i am  sharding. on that table and this node use to have 100% of data and now has 50% of data i need to some how hollowout the data. around whats located on this node. From what i can tell if you restart the server when you delete the file it seems to be fine and it gets replaced with the correct data i am guessing meta data of some sort its like 1mb to 3.5mb. I feel like the best way since its all file pointer based you should be able to rename the file even though u have the file pointer with out issues and then flag the file to be deleted when there are no rethinkdb file pointers open to it and have a new meta data file ready and waiting :)"
