      "I don't think aggressive compaction of a table file needs to be that much work.  There's not much reason for it to be a separate phase.  It certainly should not involve deactivating *all* active extents.  We should just have GC behavior tuned to what the proportion of active data or active extents is.  If it gets too sparse, it should favor collection of the extents near the end of the file.  Hopefully something similar can be done with the LBA."
