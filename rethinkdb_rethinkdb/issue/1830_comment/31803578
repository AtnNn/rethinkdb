      "The GC would basically need an \"aggressive\" mode where it marks all active extents as inactive. It would then garbage collect all extents. We would just have to make sure that it allocates new active extents at the beginning of the file. That would allow the file to be shrunk.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how easy or difficult it would be to delete empty table files completely while the database is still running. I imagine it might be tricky. What we could definitely do as a work-around is to check for empty tables on shutdown and delete the files if possible."
