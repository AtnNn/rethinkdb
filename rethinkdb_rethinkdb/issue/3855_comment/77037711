      "> I guess it would be marginally easier for people who have irc open already to be in both channels, but it'd still be splitting things up\r\n\r\nThat's what I thought. I don't think we should abandon the freenode channel. For starters not everyone has a GitHub account. Having two IRC channels doesn't sound too bad to me (we also won't advertise the Gitter one as an IRC channel. That's just how we internally can access it)."
