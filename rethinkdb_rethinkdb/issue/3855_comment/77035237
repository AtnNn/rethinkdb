      "That seems like it's for connecting to gitter with an irc client, vs. actually replicating messages across channels etc. To get the benefit, we'd need to abandon the freenode channel and move to the gitter irc channel. I guess it would be marginally easier for people who have irc open already to be in both channels, but it'd still be splitting things up"
