      "I'm not sure if adding another channel for chats would be a good idea at this time.\r\n\r\nIt would add another place for our team to be available at, and in the end both #rethinkdb on IRC as well as the possible Gitter channel might suffer from the division.\r\n(we already use Slack for internal communication, + the IRC channel for public chats)\r\n\r\nOnce RethinkDB is larger we will definitely consider this though."
