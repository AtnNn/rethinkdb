      "> I didn't realize they had IRC support.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I have found their IRC bridge support to be profoundly lacking, bordering on unusable. I regularly get disconnected. A support ticket acknowledged the problem and added that they're working on it; have not heard a follow-up. Combined with a web client that is confusingly heavy on resources, nagging prompts, and very slow, and it's overall an aggravating experience. \r\n\r\nGitter has some cool ideas (orgs + repos maps to channels, GH usernames map, markdown) that I'd like to use, but the implementation is at this time sorely lacking. A few days after trying out Gitter for a team of ~10 people, we moved to HipChat, a change that was unanimously appreciated.\r\n\r\nIMHO freenode is a much more dependable, scalable infrastructure on which to host large community discussion until and unless Gitter radically improves their clients and servers."
