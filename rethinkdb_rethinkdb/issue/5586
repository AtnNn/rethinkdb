        "While using rethinkdb import to a 9 node cluster on a table with 150m rows during a reconfigure the web interface became unusable, presumably due to very long calls reading the rethinkdb.table_status table.\r\n\r\nr.db('rethinkdb').table('table_status').count()  took 2min 5.61s., but did return the correct result of 16 tables.\r\n\r\nThe reconfigure was going from 9 shards/2 replicas -> 8 shards/2 replicas.  The interface became unusable 10-15 minutes after the import was killed.   1 replica is in the 'backfilling' state, all others are in the 'ready' state.\r\n\r\n\"status\": {\r\n\"all_replicas_ready\": false ,\r\n\"ready_for_outdated_reads\": true ,\r\n\"ready_for_reads\": true ,\r\n\"ready_for_writes\": true\r\n}"
