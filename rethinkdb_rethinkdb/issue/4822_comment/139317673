      "An indexed `getAll` shouldn't traverse the whole table unless every entry in your table has `\"\"` as its value for that secondary index.  Maybe it's reading a small number of rows in a small fraction of a second and reporting that as a large number of reads per second?  If you run the query in a loop once per second, what does the graph look like?"
