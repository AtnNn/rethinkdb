      "> I'm not sure how we are going to handle vector clock conflict, especially with data. If we don't automatically fix it, we should have something to solve them (the data is not in the semilattice)\r\n\r\nI propose that writing to a conflicted vector clock overrides the conflicting values and resolves the conflict. I don't think that we need to provide a way to find out what the conflicting values were."
