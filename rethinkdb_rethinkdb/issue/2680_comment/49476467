      "Talked to @timmaxw about this yesterday. Here is what we arrived at:\r\n\r\n- We'll have a separate system table `config` that will include cluster-wide configuration like the auth key.\r\n- We'll disambiguate server and table conflicts by automatically renaming tables by tacking on integer suffixes (e.g. `users1`/`users2`/etc.) This is user friendly and makes a lot of problems go away.\r\n- We'll add a term for renaming tables."
