      "> do you think it's important to allow specifying which shards to elect directors for to elect_directors? (and possibly, which specific director to elect?)\r\n\r\nI suggest a syntax `elect_directors(\"some_table\", {\"shard1\": \"server1\", \"shard2\": \"server2\"})`. If any keys are omitted from the map, those directors are left as they are. If the entire map is omitted, the system automatically re-elects directors for any shards that don't have reachable directors. We should also allow `dry_run=True`, which should return a map of director elections that would occur if the user called `elect_directors(\"some_table\")`. The user could also use this command to change the director even when all of the machines are available, if they wanted to do that for some reason."
