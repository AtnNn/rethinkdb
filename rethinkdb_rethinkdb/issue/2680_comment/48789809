      "A few random comments\r\n\r\n- `director_candidates` is hard to set right. Even when properly set, it may be not adapted as soon as people kill/add servers.\r\nDon't we want something like `director_candidates -> [tag1, tag2]`\r\n\r\n- If we could not use a JSON version of a range shard it would be really nice. It's really not friendly when you need to distinguish between number and strings (and I'm not talking about high unicode characters).\r\n\r\n- I'm not sure what the difference with elect_directors and just pinning a primary. Is there one?\r\n\r\n- If I set two director candidates, does it mean that I automatically get 2 secondaries?\r\n\r\n- We can use an optarg for get maybe to deal with uuid and name conflicts?\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"cluster_config').get(\"users\")\r\nr.table(\"cluster_config\").get({uuid: <uuid of table users>})\r\n```\r\n\r\n"
