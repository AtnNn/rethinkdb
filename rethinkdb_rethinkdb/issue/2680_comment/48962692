      "Since the low level API is going to replace the HTTP server and `/ajax`, here are a few things that are missing from the specs:\r\n\r\n- `ajax/stat` (read and writes) per shard and server\r\n- `/ajax/reset_data`, `/ajax/reset_session`, `ajax/make_diff` still exist in the web interface code. If no one objects, I would like to remove them. If we want to keep them, we should provide a similar interface.\r\n- I'm not sure how we are going to handle vector clock conflict, especially with data. If we don't automatically fix it, we should have something to solve them (the `data` is not in the semilattice)\r\n- There is a special case for fixing `auth_key` issues (it's not in the semilattice), so we should try not to forget it.\r\n- `ajax/distribution`, `ajax/log` and `ajax/progress` are missing from the specs."
