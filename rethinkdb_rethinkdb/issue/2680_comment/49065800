      "> `ajax/stat` (read and writes) per shard and server [...] `ajax/distribution`, `ajax/log` and `ajax/progress` are missing from the specs.\r\n\r\nI'll open a separate proposal for stats. We'll have a system `stats` table (or possibly multiple tables such as `machine_stats` and `table_stats`) that will replace `ajax/stat`, but I want to keep it out of this proposal as it's an orthogonal problem. Ditto for logs.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure about `ajax/progress` -- it might be subsumed by the status tables, or it might warrant its own table. Let's talk about that in person.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure yet what to do with `distribution`. We might want to get rid of it entirely, or keep it during the transition. We should talk about that in person.\r\n\r\n> `/ajax/reset_data`, `/ajax/reset_session`, `ajax/make_diff`\r\n\r\nI don't remember these. What do they do?\r\n\r\n> There is a special case for fixing `auth_key` issues (it's not in the semilattice), so we should try not to forget it.\r\n\r\nWe'll add a separate system `security` (`security_config`) table for authentication keys. It can later be extended to keep track of user accounts when we support that feature."
