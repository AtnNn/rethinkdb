      "There are two problems with making this change:\r\n\r\n1. It complicates the API and the documentation for `run`.\r\n2. The profiler doesn't work well with cursors -- it just returns a result for the first batch. We'll have to fix this, and will have to change the API again to account for the fix.\r\n\r\nI'd really prefer not to change the API until things like these are ironed out. Changing the API for an unstable feature in order to get around a small internal inconvenience seems like the wrong thing to do to me."
