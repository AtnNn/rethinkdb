        "Starting with `v2.3.0` we are building on MacOS 10.10 or better. This gets us a much newer build toolchain, and we are building such that we should be compatible with MacOS 10.7. So far the only issue we have encountered with this is in the https support in `r.http`: for those results we are getting an error back every time:\r\n```\r\ne: Error in HTTP GET of `https://google.com`: SSL connect error.\r\nheader:\r\nnull\r\nbody:\r\nnull in:\r\nr.http(\"https://google.com\")\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\nThe same server binary running on latter versions of MacOS (e.g. 10.10 or 10.11) produce the correct results. This is not specific to any one site, and there is nothing in the server-side logs. At minimum we are probably missing an opportunity to give a better error message in these cases.\r\n\r\n"
