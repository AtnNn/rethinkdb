      "Letting writes appear anywhere is simple and convenient. It make the implementation simple and it makes the API simple. We don't have to have a distinction between `do` and `forEach` on a single object (which for the record doesn't make any sense to me at all) or even really a distinction between `map` and `forEach`. Our users will come up with strange and wonderful ways to write queries that bury write operations deeply, I say let them.\r\n\r\nThe only reason why allowing write queries anywhere might interfere with termination is because we allow write queries to modify the data that we are presently operating on. If we had snapshot consistency for queries then this wouldn't be a problem because the `map` would be over the table as it existed before the query began executing."
