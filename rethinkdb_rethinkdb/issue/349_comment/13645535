      "By the way, do we currently support truly atomic update operations? If I run `r.table(...).update({\"score\": r.row[\"score\"]+1})` concurrently on two connections, is every row's score guaranteed to get incremented exactly twice? If so, then we make sure the update procedure doesn't contain anything nondeterministic, right? Presumably the same code could be extended to detect writes in the wrong places."
