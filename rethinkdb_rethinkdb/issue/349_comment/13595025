      "In the new QL, a write query is just a term like any other.  \"executing a write\" is just evaluating that term.  So none of the `do` examples above would error.\r\n\r\nForeach is just a map followed by a particular reduce that accumulates statistics.  Foreach could be defined as so:\r\n```ruby\r\ndef foreach(seq, *writes)\r\n  seq.map{|x| r([*writes]).reduce{|a,b| <stats reduction>}}\r\nend\r\n```"
