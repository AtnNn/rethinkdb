      "A write operation currently fails with an error if it tries to execute on a shard.  If we want to do this properly, we should probably force the stream onto one machine in that case instead of just failing.  (But you should probably never be executing a write operation on a shard anyway; that almost certainly means you're using `map` instead of `foreach`.)\r\n\r\nSince write queries are just terms in the new QL code, we would have to explicitly look for and disallow queries where they're nested, so if we're worried about release dates we should probably leave it as-is.  That said, I think we could write a write-queries-are-in-the-right-place checker and still make the release on the 28th."
