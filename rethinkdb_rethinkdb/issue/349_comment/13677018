      "We push maps to the shards, I believe.  I think (but would have to check) that getting back a lazy iterator means your code is being pushed to the shards, so forbidding writes on shards would require forbidding writes inside all functions applied to lazy streams.\r\n\r\nWe can't allow writes on a shard because there's a possibility for deadlock.  Two shards trying to write to each other might get hung, both holding a lock on part of the btree that the other needs to complete its write and release its lock.\r\n\r\nI think we should try hard to allow writes in a `do` (the original cause of this discussion) and in a `branch` (because it opens up a lot of useful behavior)."
