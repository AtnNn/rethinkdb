      "Ah I see. In 1.3 and earlier we didn't allow just evaluating a write query anywhere, which is what got me confused.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons we didn't is presumably because of the type system, which is now gone. Another reason is that we could control the command more and guarantee that it doesn't get into infinite loops. With the evaluation model here we can't do that anymore (which is bad because an unwritten rule in the database world is that programs must be provably terminable).\r\n\r\nI think this is worth thinking about more seriously because I'm not sure that allowing evaluating writes outside of a few well-defined contexts is a good idea.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner, @wmrowan, @timmaxw -- you had lots of thoughts on this before. What do you think?"
