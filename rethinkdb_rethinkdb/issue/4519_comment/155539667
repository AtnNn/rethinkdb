      "> The permission system in its first version isn't going to be granular enough to restrict access to particular documents in a given table, so it wouldn't be very useful in a `filter`.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes sorry if I was unclear, that wasn't the intention behind `r.access()`. I only meant for it to be used in conjunction with the `users` system table. If I want to filter users who have `read` access on a particular table, that needs to take into account users with `*`, `<db>`, or `<db>.<table>` level `read` permissions. I was saying we might need something like `r.access()` to do all that for you."
