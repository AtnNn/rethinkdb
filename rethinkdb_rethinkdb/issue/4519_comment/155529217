      "We've currently been optimising `r.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"users\")` for readability, as its main purpose is to display the current settings. The idea is to add `r.grant` to set permissions, but querying them is still problematic.\r\n\r\nWe could have `r.grant(\"user\")` give a list of permissions, then set them through `r.grant(\"user\", {\"read\": true, \"write\": false})`. In that case using the name `r.access` might be better."
