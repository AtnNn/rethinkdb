      "@deontologician `.filter(r.row('access')('$read'))` is slightly nicer than `.filter(r.row('access')('*').contains('read'))` in raw ReQL, but with a term like `.access()` suggested above document structure wouldn't matter as much. Like I said, I think we need something like that anyway because computing the cascade in a `filter` would be a huge pain regardless of structure."
