      "> Another advantage of a single table is that it will let you create a new user with certain permissions and a certain password in a single ReQL command.\r\n\r\nOk I think that's a pretty strong argument.\r\n\r\nI personally have a slight preference for the syntax without `$`\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, we're all at least ok with that syntax and a single table.\r\n\r\nI'll wait another 1-2 hours in case there's strong opposition, but otherwise I'm going to mark this settled with:\r\nOne table with deeper-nested non-$ syntax."
