      "@danielmewes -- I did indeed mean something similar for the database name and have updated the original comment to reflect this. It means the nesting is even deeper, to the point of it being unreadable which is exactly what we were trying to prevent.\r\n\r\n@marshall007 -- I quite like this idea, we only allow `A-Za-z0-9_` in database and table names thus it would work nicely. With our current lexicographical sorting for object keys the `\"*\"` would even be shown as the first item. I'm not sure we use `.` as a namespace separator anywhere else though, and whether we want to start doing so."
