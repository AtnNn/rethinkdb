      "One argument against using a dot instead of actual nesting is that doing `table['access'][db_name][table_name]` is more natural in reql than splitting on '.' This isn't a problem for `.grant` since it can do arbitrary stuff under the hood, but it'd be nice if accessing the table in reql wasn't painful"
