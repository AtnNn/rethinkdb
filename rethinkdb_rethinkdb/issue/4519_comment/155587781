      "* How attached are we to the name `r.grant`?  I think something like `r.permit` might be clearer.  (If you're already primed to think of permissions than `grant` clearly means \"grant permission\", but if you aren't then it's pretty vague.)\r\n* I much prefer @deontologician's syntax to the one with the `*`s and `db.table`s.  I think we should avoid special symbols if we can, for the reasons other people mentioned above.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> The permission system in its first version isn't going to be granular enough to restrict access to particular documents in a given table, so it wouldn't be very useful in a filter.\r\n\r\nWe're adding this now at least partially because Fusion needs it, right?  If that's the case, isn't \"restricting access to particular documents\" a necessary part of the spec?  Or are we going to do that part outside of the database?"
