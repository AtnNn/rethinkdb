      "@marshall007 -- That's a good point, it might make sense to simply use the empty string for the global scope.\r\n\r\n@deontologician -- Exactly, that was my initial worry regarding the `.` separator.

I'm currently rethinking that as it's considerably more readable than the deep nesting in the original proposal."
