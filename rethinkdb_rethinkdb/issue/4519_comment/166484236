      "For the record, I think this is better.\r\n\r\nIf you have a bunch of users and tables, having a flat hierarchy with all permissions in one list will get hard to read I think.\r\n\r\nIn practice you will often need to filter or group on the flat table to get useful results, and the variable-length primary key array makes those operations non-trivial to perform.\r\n\r\nHaving permissions grouped by users on the other hand is immediately useful (you can easily get an answer to the question \"what are the permissions for user X\"), and it intuitively represents how table permissions override the permissions of the containing database, which in turn override the global permissions of the given user."
