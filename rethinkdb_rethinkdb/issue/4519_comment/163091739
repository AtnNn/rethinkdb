      "I still think the name `permit` is much more obvious than `grant`, especially if it's called directly on a table (`r.table('test').permit('user', {$read: true}))`).\r\n\r\nI generally like the current proposal, but @coffeemug mentioned that he might have an alternate one that avoids the `$` so we should probably wait for him to write that up before debating the exact format too much."
