      "I like @VeXocide's latest proposal (separate `users` and `permissions`, single `permissions` entry per user.)\r\n\r\nI think the benefit from using special meta-characters like `$` in these dicts is when they can be combined with user data _at the same level_, which is why I think they're acceptable in the MongoDB query language. _That's not the case here_; the hierarchy is `type/id/type/id/type`, which extends cleanly to new types (which only we can define) and new ids for any type (which the user already manages conflicts for.)\r\n\r\n*In this structure, there are no dicts where predefined type names and user defined collection names are keys at the same level.* Because of that, I prefer no `$`."
