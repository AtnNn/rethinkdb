      "Looking at the actual example the `$read` / `$write` / `$config` syntax described by @deontologician actually looks nice I think.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the `r.access()` method is necessary in the first version. The permission system in its first version isn't going to be granular enough to restrict access to particular documents in a given table, so it wouldn't be very useful in a `filter`.\r\n@marshall007 do you have a particular use case in mind?"
