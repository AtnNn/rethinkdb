      "Another reason I'm fine with the `$` syntax: it's assigning special meaning to a symbol, but only in a *specific admin table*, where I think that's a lot more appropriate than having a special symbol that means something database-wide.  It's the difference between having special syntax in config files for a particular program and having special syntax in all text files."
