      "@chrisguidry There are no other knobs to turn at the moment. Though these are the other principal uses of memory by RethinkDB apart from the cache:\r\n- a constant overhead per table in the cluster (few MB per table)\r\n- A bit of overhead proportional to the total (on-disk) size of the data on a given node, up to roughly 1/20th of the data size (see #1951).\r\n- Memory for storing intermediate data for each running query and background operation (e.g. backfills, secondary index postconstruction)\r\n- In certain cases: Additional overhead relative to the table size for certain administrative operations (e.g. deleting a secondary index). This is being worked on #2329.\r\n- The coroutine stacks that @coffeemug mentioned. We keep up to 8 MB worth of unused coroutine stacks in a backup pool, per CPU core on the machine (i.e. if your machine has 4 cores, it will be up to 32 MB).\r\n\r\n*Edit:* Added coroutine stacks to the list"
