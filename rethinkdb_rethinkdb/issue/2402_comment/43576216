      "@chrisguidry Good point.\r\nThe size is the size of an internal serialization format. It is roughly comparable to the size of a corresponding JSON string (without spaces or newlines), except for numbers and booleans which are stored more efficiently than in the string representation.\r\nIt can be a few bytes larger in some cases and a few bytes smaller in others.\r\n\r\n(If you want to find out all the details and are ok with reading code, you can look at the function `size_t serialized_size(const counted_t<const datum_t> &datum)` defined in `src/rdb_protocol/datum.cc`. Essentially it's one byte for the type, followed by length-prefixed serializations of the fields of the object)"
