      "@dmitrig01 the behavior you observe can probably be explained by this memory leak https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2899 . It is triggered by queries that use `pluck`, `without`, `with_fields` or `has_fields`. Are you using any of these terms?\r\n\r\nWe will release a point release for 1.13 very soon with the fix (or alternatively we might ship 1.14.0, if it gets done quickly enough)."
