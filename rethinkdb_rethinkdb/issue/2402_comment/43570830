      "The cache holds the actual data and index blocks from disk in memory. The cache can be arbitrarily small (but there is some lower bound), in which case the database gets slower because it has to go to disk to load data and indexes.\r\n\r\nHere are some other components that allocate memory:\r\n\r\n* Coroutine stacks -- RethinkDB uses a custom green threading engine to multiplex multiple operations on OS threads. Each coroutine uses some heap memory for its stack.\r\n* QL engine -- when you run a query the execution engine allocates some memory while the query is running.\r\n* Misc. -- this is a big blog of a category and includes various bookkeeping data structures that make everything tick.\r\n\r\nOther than the cache there are no knobs that I can think of (but there are plenty of internal compile-time knobs for us to tweak).
