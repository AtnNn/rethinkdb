      "@chrisguidry Both adding a node and increasing the memory per existing node will work. As long as it's economical (i.e. nodes with more memory don't cost too much more) I would recommend sticking with two nodes and just increasing the memory. \r\nBoth options allow you to store more data overall.\r\nHowever, as things are now, RethinkDB needs a certain amount of memory to work reliably, and adding another node doesn't help with that (in fact it can slightly increase the memory overhead for things like backfilling)."
