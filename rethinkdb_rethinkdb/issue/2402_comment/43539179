      "Thank you @chrisguidry for chiming in. Have you observed another crash since lowering the cache size to 128 MB?\r\n\r\nThe fact that it crashes regularly after 20 hours with a 1 GB cache is certainly suspicious.\r\nI will look into it. Might have to ask for some more information about your workloads later @dmitrig01 @chrisguidry, if that's ok?"
