      "@dmitrig01 That climbing memory consumption could hint towards a bug in RethinkDB. Unless it's just caused by the cache actually being used over time. A memory consumption of 4682 MB for a 3131 MB cache is not unreasonable, given the number of tables you have.\r\n\r\n@chrisguidry Thank you for keeping us posted. Given the fact that it has run out of memory for a 1024 MB cache before on a 3.7 GB machine, I expect that memory consumption will increase a bit more over time for the 128 MB cache though. We will see."
