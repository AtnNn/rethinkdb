      "Thanks for the feedback @chrisguidry and @dmitrig01 .\r\n\r\n@dmitrig01 we recently found https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2744 , though that leak only happens in very specific cases. Specifically when regularly dealing with illegal values that RethinkDB rejects (e.g. strings that contain null characters etc.). It's unlikely that that one is the cause of what you are seeing, unless such cases occur frequently in your application.\r\n\r\nI will keep this on my list and run more long-term tests then, to see if I can replicate that problem."
