      "@dmitrig01 The RethinkDB server calculates the default size for its internal cache using a simple heuristic (half of the available RAM on startup minus some constant to account for overhead).\r\nRight now each table has some considerable memory overhead in addition to its cache. The exact overhead depends on the amount of data in the tables, but ~50 MB per table is a reasonable estimate.\r\n\r\nUnless you have explicitly specified a cache size when starting the server, it's possible that the cache size chosen by default is slightly too large. Could you check the server logs to find out which cache size the server picked on your AWS node? There should be a line like `info: Using cache size of 4494 MB` in there.\r\nYou can specify a smaller cache size manually by starting the server with the `--cache-size <SIZE IN MB>` command line argument, or if you use the init script to start the server by putting a line `cache-size=<SIZE IN MB>` into the configuration file under /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d."
