      "Our experiment of running with a 128M cache appears to be working for now.  We've been at 1.4Gb resident (1.7Gb virtual) for 8+ hours or so, which appears to be stable.\r\n\r\nCan you give us a rough idea of the big categories of RethinkDB memory allocation?  I see we can turn a knob for the cache-size, but what is in that cache?  Are there other knobs to turn?"
