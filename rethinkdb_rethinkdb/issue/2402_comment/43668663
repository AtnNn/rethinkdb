      "Quick checkin: after 24 hours, we're still at 1.4Gb resident/1.7Gb virtual under our normal workload with cache-size=128.  I think we're going to be okay for now, but I'll keep my ears open for a fix to the memory leak here so we can use more of the RAM we're paying for :)\r\n\r\nThanks for all the info, it will definitely help us with future design and capacity planning decisions."
