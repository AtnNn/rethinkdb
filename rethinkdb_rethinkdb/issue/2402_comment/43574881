      "@danielmewes, another question: generally speaking, is memory proportional to document size, document count, or both?  In other words, what is the trade-off between many small documents versus fewer large documents?  After some benchmarking on 1.11, we generally favor larger documents (when most of the data are accessed together anyway), but is there anything in 1.12 that might change this?\r\n"
