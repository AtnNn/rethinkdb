      "Hi mlucy,\r\n\r\nThanks for your response. I considered that, but I'd like to be able to specify multiple instances of the first part of the compound key which don't fall in a between range. Basically, to specify several distinct keys and then order by the second part of the compound index. It doesn't seem this is possible using the Between workaround, but again I may be missing something! "
