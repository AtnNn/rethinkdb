      "This issue is a little more subtle than this. These names are meant to local to the module and hidden from the client. This is true in node where imported modules are automatically wrapped in a new function scope to contain such local names.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem in the browser where local variables declared at the top level scope are bound to window. This problem will be fixed when we eventually get around to getting rid of closure and use browserify to package the node package for consumption in the browser."
