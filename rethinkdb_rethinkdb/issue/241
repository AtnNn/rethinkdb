        "Currently, attempting to save a NumPy array as value in a dictionary in the Python driver is not supported. Try:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy\r\nr.table('users').insert({'name': 'Slava', 'age': 29,   \r\n'some_2d_array':numpy.random.random((100,100)) }).run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill return the error:\r\n```AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'iteritems'```\r\n\r\nNumPy arrays, along with many built-in Python types, can pickle themselves into compact binary representations using \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport cPickle\r\nbinary_string = cPickle.dumps(numpy.random.random((100,100)))\r\nr.table('users').insert({'name': 'Slava', 'age': 29,   \r\n'some_2d_array':binary_string }).run()\r\ndoc = r.table('users').filter(lambda doc: doc['name'] == 'Slava').run()\r\nretrieved_array = cPickle.loads(str(doc['some_2d_array']))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be very desirable to be able to work with objects that can pickle themselves without having to add wrapper code, and seems like an achievable feature.
