        "I was doing some profiling on an insert workload, and our batched replace code could use some work.\r\n\r\nOn a batched insert where the actual call to `access->get_namespace_if()->write(...)` takes about 50ms, you can expect to spend another 5-10ms just constructing/destructing the vector of `datum_func_pair_t`s.  (The rest of the work, including JSON parsing, comes out to around 6ms.)\r\n\r\nThe situation is worse for actual batched replaces.  As far as I can tell from looking at the code, if we have a batched replace containing 10 point replaces, we serialize the replacement function 10 times.\r\n\r\nThe batched_replace code needs to be reworked so that instead of always having a vector of `<key,function>` pairs, it has either a vector of `<key,datum>` pairs or a vector of keys with a single function."
