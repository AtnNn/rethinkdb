      "> @marshall007: Would this also apply when selecting tables themselves?\r\n> \r\n> ```js\r\n> r.union(\r\n>   r.table('tasks'),\r\n>   r.table('sources')\r\n> ).indexCreate('customer_id')\r\n> \r\n> r.union(\r\n>   r.table('tasks'),\r\n>   r.table('sources')\r\n> ).getAll(id, { index: 'customer_id' })\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n> @danielmewes: The `index` example I think would be a separate step. Do you think this would actually be useful compared to putting the `getAll` inside the `union`?\r\n\r\nI don't think it would be that useful except maybe in a database-per-customer scenario where all the tables are the same. I was mostly asking to see if things like that would be an emergent property of maintaining selections in `r.union`. So I don't think it's worth explicitly supporting if that's not the case."
