        "How about introducing a way of referring to records using their physical location? I don't believe such a way of referencing is common among DBs, but it might be pretty neat and go hand-in-hand with #4853. Excerpt from the documentation of a Graph database:\r\n\r\n> A RID (Record ID) is the physical position of the record inside the database. This means that loading a record by its RID is blazing fast, even with a growing database. With document and relational DBMS the more data you have, the slower the database will be. Joins have a heavy runtime cost. The DB handles relationships as physical links to the records. The relationship is assigned only once when the edge is created O(1). Compare this to an RDBMS that \"computes\" the relationship every single time you query a database O(LogN). Traversing speed is not affected by the database size. It is always constant, whether for one record or 100 billion records. This is critical in the age of Big Data\r\n"
