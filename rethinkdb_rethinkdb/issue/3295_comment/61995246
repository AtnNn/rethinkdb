      "Some flags such as `-fsanitize` and `-flto` need to be passed both when compiling and when linking to work properly. However I can't find any flags that might be put in `CXXFLAGS` that would cause problems when linking.\r\n\r\nI have looked at the makefiles of a few other projects I have lying around. Some do this and some don't."
