      "This will happen if one of the proxies was given join addresses from both the first and the second cluster.\r\nThe other thing that could cause this is if a server in the first cluster is started under a port and IP address that used to have a server from the second cluster.\r\n\r\nTo clean up this situation, you'll have to completely take down all proxies and servers from both clusters, and then start them up again. It is important that there is a moment where all servers are down. That clears their memory of connected servers."
