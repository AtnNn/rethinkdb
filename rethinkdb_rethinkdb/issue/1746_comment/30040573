      "The timeout is currently set to 15 seconds.\r\nIf we can't retrieve `/ajax` in 15 seconds, the interface will say that you are disconnected.\r\n\r\nThe content in `/ajax` and in `/ajax/stat` can be pretty big, so yep it's possible to get a timeout if your connection is not fast enough.\r\nA of one node cluster and 10 tables (1 shard per table) requires about 125kB/s.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo things can be done to fix this problem:\r\n- Send diff for `/ajax`\r\n- Report only the stats used by the ui in `/ajax/stat` (or less things at least).\r\n"
