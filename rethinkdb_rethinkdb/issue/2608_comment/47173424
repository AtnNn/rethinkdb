      "Hi @cultofmetatron,\r\n\r\nIf by \"remove that field in the map\" you mean you don't want it in the output stream, you can use `without`:\r\n```js\r\nr.table('users').hasFields(query).without('field')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to remove the field so that it's no longer stored in your table, you have to use `replace` or `update` to do that:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table('users').filter(r.row.hasFields(query)).replace(r.row.without('field'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou need to do a `filter` rather than just calling `hasFields` because right no `hasFields` returns a stream rather than a selection.  (I think this is a bug, I'll open a separate issue for that.)\r\n\r\n"
