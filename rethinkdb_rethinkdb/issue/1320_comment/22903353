      "I consider the current python behavior to be a bug. I don't know how the ruby driver does argument checking but it could have a similar problem.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this question is completely outside of the scope of this issue. If you want to argue about driver behavior with respect to single argument `r.add` etc. please comment on #1312. I believe (at least in the case of `r.add`) that the server accepts a single argument version in which case it becomes a no-op. While that is behavior we'll have to address if / when we decided to look at function currying, it is not relevant here since `thing.map(r.add(1))` still would fail with a type error on the server, as I said above."
