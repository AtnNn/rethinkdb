      "The syntax described in this issue already works by accident in the Python driver. I looked into getting the same working in the JS driver but a similar issue (related to how variatic functions report the number of parameters they take) is blocking us there. A solution to that problem will not be a straight forward as the equivalent in the Python driver. @atnnn's idea of enforcing lambda airity on the client side could potentially make this a lot easier in all drivers but would involve superficially more extensive changes. Insert here the usual caveat about ruby.\r\n\r\nIf / when we decided to pick this up again this should be relatively straight forward to finish. I'd say this issue is more about documenting this particular syntax option than actually getting any new code to work. If I get bored working on my much more important work for 1.9 I might just finish fixing this for JS. We can just leave the feature undocumented until we're ready to slip some line about it in an otherwise slow release announcement."
