      "@mpoon -- ok, I see. RethinkDB (and any other database) depends on certain guarantees from the file system. For example, if the file system says a write is on disk, the write needs to actually be on disk for the database to guarantee consistency. Many distributed file systems (e.g. nfs, etc.) lie about these guarantees to software built on top of them for performance reasons (otherwise, distributed file system performance would be dismal). Unfortunately, these file systems aren't suitable to run databases on top of them, and RethinkDB isn't an exception here.\r\n\r\nI'm closing the issue since there isn't anything we can do about errors on file systems that don't offer posix guarantees. However, please feel free to post here so we can help you recover your data. Do you have a recent backup that you can use?"
