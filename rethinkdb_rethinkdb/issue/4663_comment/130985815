      "Thanks for the top output @balasuar. That's quite helpful. \r\nThe interesting thing is that the memory usage is spread over multiple rethinkdb processes. Usually RethinkDB uses only one process (plus a second one which should use almost no memory though). There is one exception to this, in that we fork additional processes when executing `r.js` or `r.http` terms. \r\n\r\nI assume you're running only one instance of RethinkDB on this server? Or are you running multiple ones on the same machine?\r\n\r\nAre you using r.js in your application?\r\nif the answer to that is yes, I strongly suspect that our memory leak lies in that part of our code, which would be a great start for us to isolate the problem.
