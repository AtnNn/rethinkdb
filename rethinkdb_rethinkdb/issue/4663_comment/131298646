      "I was able to reproduce the problem by running one of your `r.js` queries repeatedly.\r\n\r\nThe JS worker processes initially used about 40-50 MB of RAM, but use more and more over time (I got them to ~270 MB each within half an hour, and there are 8 of them).\r\n\r\nThe next step is to figure out what they are using that memory for, and why it's growing.\r\n\r\nIn the worst case, we could probably restart the JS worker processes periodically to clean up their memory. It would be nicer though to fix this properly."
