      "Thanks for the information @balasuar . I don't quite understand what New Relic is measuring from the page you linked to. It's talking about \"physical memory\" first, but then also says \"It uses the reported virtual set size for a process and multiplies that by that process's number of active instances.\". So I'm not sure if the reported value is physical memory or virtual memory.\r\n\r\nJust to make sure, would you mind also checking memory usage with a tool such as `top` or `htop` the next time the server is using a lot of RAM? The relevant column in these tools is \"RES\"."
