      "We might also want to give getting rid of the old `static_semaphore_t` and `adjustable_semaphore_t` another shot. The last time this was difficult because of a certain piece of throttling code in the clustering layer. But I think this code is no longer there, so this might have become easier now.\r\nIf we can remove these types, we will be able to rename `new_semaphore_t` to `semaphore_t`."
