      "This can be fairly easily reproduced by running `curl http://<server>/ajax/progress/`.  This specifies an empty machine UUID 'resource', which then fails to parse.  The `progress_app_t` should not be allowing these exceptions to be thrown outside of its scope, it should just error the request.  Working on this now."
