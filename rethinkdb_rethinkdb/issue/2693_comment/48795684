      "And while someone is doing that, the `test_verify` test currently depends on `https://dev.rethinkdb.com` having a self-signed certificate, and `http://dev.rethinkdb.com` returning a `301` redirect to `https://dev.rethinkdb.com`. Rather than depending on all of this it would be better to spin up a http server with `twisted` and some self-generated certificates and then connect to that."
