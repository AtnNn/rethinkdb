      "Are you sure you want captialization?  It will mean we should use complete sentences and punctuation, which can look awkward on the command-line.  I am also not sure what you mean by friendliness, I can add some pleases and thank yous, but I don't think anyone would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThe `['stars']` thing was an easy enough fix, it was printing out the split array rather than the original option string.\r\n\r\nFor reference, here are all the errors that may occur during import before it actually starts doing work:\r\n```\r\nCould not determine rethinkdb python client version, unrecognized format: '%s'\r\nCould not import pkg_resources, please install the python setuptools package.\r\nIncompatible version of rethinkdb python client installed.
