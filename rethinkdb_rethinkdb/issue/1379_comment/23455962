      "We once had an idea of renaming `run` to `run_please`, but I don't think this is what @mglukhovsky is talking about here :)\r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts:\r\n\r\n* I think we do want capitalization. It doesn't mean we have to print complete sentences and periods, but I do think we should consistently capitalize the first letter of each error message. For example, renaming `invalid 'host:port' format` to `Invalid 'host:port' format` seems way better to me. We already capitalize some messages but not others, we should just be consistent about everything.\r\n* Some messages are a bit confusing. For example, `invalid 'db.table' format` isn't as clear about the problem as it could be. Does it mean I didn't pass the right format, or I passed the right format but it's invalid, or what? One way to improve the message would be to say \"The table specification is invalid. Use the 'db.table' format\".\r\n\r\nI think most messages are fine, but a few could use a little bit of clarification and capitalization."
