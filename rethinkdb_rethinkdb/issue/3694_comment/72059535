      "This goes away if I for example increase the `file_reverse_reader_t::chunk_size` from 4096 to 4097.\r\nIf I then add a single character to some log message at the beginning of the file, it appears again.\r\nProbably a bug if a newline falls exactly onto a chunk boundary or something like that.\r\n\r\nI think this is *not* a new bug.\r\nThe latest modification to file_reverse_reader_t as far as I can see was https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/commit/2d83a67cab24c114f4b9c82c9fdc8601b271628e which is already in 1.15.0 and onwards.\r\n\r\nWhen the error shows up, it's more visible in the new web UI with ReQL admin. Previously it seems like if a log entry was illegal, all log entries would simply appear as blank. Now we get a very visible ReQL error message.\r\n\r\nRe-assigning to @Tryneus since you were the last to work with the file."
