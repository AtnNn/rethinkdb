      "As a side note, I'd add that I had some _serious_ weirdness going on when I was first trying to setup the cluster -- each server had very different port offsets given as command-line flags, but a few of them reported as connecting on the wrong intracluster port and showed up as ghost servers in the web UI and had to have their `rethinkdb_data` directories deleted.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that was unrelated. I also couldn't reproduce this, so I chalked it up to gremlins."
