      "@gigname note that RethinkDB is not built for accessing the database server directly from the browser, in case that's what you have in mind. RethinkDB doesn't currently implement the complex authentication and authorization system that you would need for such a setup.\r\n\r\nHowever as @grandquista said you can definitely use JavaScript to develop your application. Our JavaScript driver is built to run in a node.js backend server.\r\n\r\n(also: not a bug, closing)"
