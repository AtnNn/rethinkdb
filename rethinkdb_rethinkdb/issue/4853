        "I'd like to propose adding a document reference pseudotype to the database to store foreign keys, and build some operations around it in the server and the drivers.\n\nSuppose you have two tables `authors` and `posts`. Each post has a field `author`:\n\n``` py\n# insert a document into the `posts` table\n> r.table('posts').insert({ 'text': 'foo', 'author': ref(db, table, uuid) })\n```\n\nI propose a `follow_refs` optarg to `run`:\n\n``` py\n> post = r.table('posts').get(post_uuid).run()\n> post\n{ 'text': 'foo', 'author': ref(uuid) }\n\n> post['author']\nref(db, table, uuid)\n\n# References are runnable on the driver\n> post['author'].run()\n{'name': 'foo', 'age': 'bar'}\n\n# We can also follow references on the server\n> r.table('posts').get(post_uuid).run(follow_refs=True)\n{ 'text': 'foo', 'author': {'name': 'foo', 'age': 'bar'} }\n\n# Similarly for deletes:\n> r.table('posts').get(post_uuid).delete().run(follow_refs=True)\n# deletes both the post and its author\n```\n\nThe `follow_refs` optarg could also be an integer that specifies the depth the server will use to follow the refs. Presumably `-1` will follow all refs (but what to do about cycles?)\n\nThis will make the user experience much better for a large class of use cases, and will also make Falcor integration much more compelling because \"following\" references is a fundamental assumption baked into Falcor.\n"
