      "Splitting an array in 2 is something that is defined (not in ReQL, but in general).\r\nSo having `split` to recurse in streams and split each element if they are a string is confusing..\r\n\r\nCan someone point out an example where splitting on a stream is useful? All the examples I have in my mind use a `group`/`map` after, in which case users can split inside the `group`/`map`.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso here's an example that is confusing\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"foo\")(\"text\").split().contains(\"hello\")\r\n```\r\nis not the same as\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"foo\").map( r.row(\"text\").split().contains(\"hello\") )\r\n```\r\n\r\n"
