      "@neumino My apologies. The language I was working with when I needed the limit expected the number to be the string position to stop at but I do agree the way you corrected would be much better and I would have been able to implement it the same had I had the same ability. \r\n\r\nTo contribute to the discussion, PHP's equivalent of split (explode) takes a limit argument and allows it to be negative. A negative value returns all splits except for the last *limit* elements. A possible example use case for this is to split a path into its component directories without the file part. "
