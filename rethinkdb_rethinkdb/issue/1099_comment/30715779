      "I thought of showcasing the query as follows:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nstream.group(lambda x: x['text'].downcase().split(), multi=True)\r\n      .count()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems really nice to me. It's also really powerful because we could explain how everything ties together, how you could intersperse map/reduce operations with regular stream operations and how they're the same thing, etc. That's independent of the whole `split` issue though."
