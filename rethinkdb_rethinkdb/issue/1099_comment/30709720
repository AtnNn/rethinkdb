      "TL;DR: I think that for now we should do what Python does and call it a day.\r\n\r\nI feel neutral about `filter_empty` -- if someone feels strongly about adding it I wouldn't be opposed to it, but I wouldn't insist on it myself. Personally, I wouldn't add it because I think it's outside of the scope of the 80/20 rule for two reasons:\r\n\r\n* If a user merely complains about the behavior, we can always point them to Python docs. Python has a strong enough gravity field that it alone would act as a sufficient explanation.\r\n* If someone really needs this behavior, they can work around this edge case by using an explicit separator, and manually chaining a `filter` query at the end. It's less pleasant than `filter_empty` but it will get the job done, and the use case is fairly rare.\r\n\r\nWe can always add `filter_empty` later if necessary (but we probably won't, since I suspect this would have fairly limited demand for the above reasons)."
