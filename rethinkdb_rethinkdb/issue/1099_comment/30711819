      "I also get the sense that you guys are a little bit reluctant to reconsider the spec at this point which I think is kind of unreasonable considering that I asked for this proposal to be spelled out in ReQL terms and what I got was:\r\n\r\n> * `str.split()` -- split on whitespace\r\n> * `str.split(\"\\t\")` -- split on hard tabs\r\n> * `str.split(\"\\t\", 5)` -- split on hard tabs at most 5 times (so at most 6 elements in the list)\r\n> * `str.split(nil, 5)` -- split on whitespace at most 5 times (so at most 6 elements in the list)\r\n\r\nwhich really doesn't allow for these corner cases to be discussed before the proposal is marked \"settled.\""
