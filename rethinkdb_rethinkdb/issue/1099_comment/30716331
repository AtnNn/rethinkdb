      "Ah, I see.\r\n\r\nI disagree with @neumino. I think as a general rule, we should distribute over sequences unless there is a compelling reason not to for the specific operation. You learn about it once and it's immensely useful.\r\n\r\nFor example if `downcase` could be distributed over sequences, you could write `lambda x: x['text'].downcase().split()` and `lambda x: x['text'].split().downcase()`, which I think is really nice."
