      "I feel kind of strongly about this for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- The only use case I've heard in which people want the empty strings is CSV and I think that's a very unlikely use case because we don't support quoting for CSV. For 99% of users of this feature the empty strings are just going to be a constant annoyance that they have to filter out.\r\n- This is what Ruby does and I think it's much closer to what people want. Also as a side note the code in the code review doesn't match the python behavior, it uses Ruby's behavior in some corner cases.\r\n- It's actually much simpler to implement and explain this behavior. So it's less work for more benefit.\r\n- Defaults like this can be annoying to work around in the future if we want to keep backward compatibility. You paint yourself in a bit of a corner if you allow regex in the future because there isn't a sane way to implement it such that `.split(\"\\w+\")` is the same as `.split()` although it really seems like they should be."
