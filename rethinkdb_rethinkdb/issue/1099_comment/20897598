      "One problem with the proposal as it stands is that it doesn't allow empty entries between splits.  In particular, the example shows `\"hello, world\"` getting split into `[\"hello\", \"world\"]` when given '[\",\", \" \"]' as the strings to split on.\r\n\r\nWhat about a comma-separated values string like `\"a,b,,c,def,g,\"`?  Then you'd want both empty strings to be included, both the one in the middle and the one at the end.  Another example: splitting `\"x:y:\"` on `\":\"`.  Probably in such a case (colon-separated fields in the style of the PATH variable) you'd want three results."
