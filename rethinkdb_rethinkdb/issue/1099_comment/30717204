      "Also about the argument\r\n> You learn about it once and it's immensely useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it's not a valid argument because it still delivers a bad experience.\r\n.\r\nI recently saw someone trying to do\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"foo\").filter( r.row.hasFields(\"field\").not() ).run(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd was stuck with\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"foo\").hasFields(\"field\").run(..)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause `not()` doesn't recurse in a stream."
