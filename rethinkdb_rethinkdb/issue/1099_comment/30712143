      "I'm not opposed to reconsidering the spec or adding this feature, especially since this case didn't show up in discussion. I like the addition. I also think your first point above (for 99% of users of this feature the empty strings are just going to be a constant annoyance that they have to filter out) is a very good argument. I just don't feel too strongly about adding it myself, that's all."
