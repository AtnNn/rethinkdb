      "If I may chime in and give some feedback.\r\n<blockquote>\r\nAnother thing we can do instead is make --bind localhost explicit in the default config file, and add a clear comment saying the user should change it to bind --all if they want rethink to be accessible from outside the network. We can also print a warning when the user calls init.d (start or restart) if bind is set to localhost.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nI feel this would be a perfect solution. Binding to localhost by default is widely accepted and it's a perfect way to start. If I then want to access it on another interface I am more than happy to do that manually."
