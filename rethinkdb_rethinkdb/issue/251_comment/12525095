      "My reasoning here was that the user would be manually copying the config file to get rethink to start on startup, so making `bind -all` be a default option is acceptable, but I definitely agree with what you're saying.\r\n\r\nAnother thing we can do instead is make `--bind localhost` explicit in the default config file, and add a clear comment saying the user should change it to `bind --all` if they want rethink to be accessible from outside the network. We can also print a warning when the user calls `init.d` (start or restart) if bind is set to localhost."
