        "Currently I believe it's possible to get the post construction code in to a very weird state if you rapidly delete and readd a sindex with the same name. Here's what the issue looks - like:\r\n\r\n- User creates sindex `foo` named \"foo\"\r\n- Post construction 1 starts for `foo`\r\n- User deletes `foo` and adds `foo'` (also called \"foo\" but possible with a different index function.)\r\n- Post construction 1 starts applying its changes to `foo`\r\n- User Post construction 2 starts for 'foo'`\r\n\r\nNow we have 2 post constructions targetting the same sindex which is a big big problem. This issue is probably going to be very hard to reproduce. It also wasn't a problem before #575 was fixed because we were using uuids. Using uuids somewhere in here might be a good way to solve this. But there might be other better ways as well."
