      "@coffeemug asked me to chime in here since @neumino had concerns about arrays vs streams. Here are my thoughts:\r\n\r\nThe first and foremost priority I have as a developer is that I don't want a query to accidentally take down the server (or reduce service quality for other queries).\r\n\r\nAlways returning an array results in a predictable cost being incurred (I have to know which queries return arrays vs streams, and that getting the array is a hefty amount of data being returned all at once). The alternative (streams) means I might have to worry about dealing with cases where the query reduces performance or takes down the entire server. Unpredictability is strictly worse than a known cost.\r\n\r\nThe key here is __good documentation__. Advertising which queries return a stream and which queries return arrays, providing clear errors or documentation on how simply creating an index allows me to get my friendly streams, and why this cost is being incurred is bearable -- once it's been explained to me."
