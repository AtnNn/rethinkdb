      "This is actually a lot easier to hit than I thought before because it happens in the data explorer. If you type `r.table(\"foo\").orderBy(...)` in the data explorer then unless you click through all of the results you'll be leaking memory. We have some things that are supposed to time these streams out but they seem to be broken somehow. Right now once you do an in memory `orderBy` in the data explorer you have about 5 minutes to click through all the results. If you don't whatever's left on the server will sit in memory until you kill the process. It never gets reclaimed."
