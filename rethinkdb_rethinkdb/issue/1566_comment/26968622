      "@neumino it is not actually. Even if #1135 were implemented this would still return an `ARRAY`. We could in theory add an indexed version of `distinct` ie `distinct(index=\"foo\")` and that would return a stream. But seeing as we don't even have a version of distinct that takes a function and AFAIK no one has requested one I'm not totally sure this is actually something people would care about."
