      "> Making a difference between `array` and `stream` is just a way to force them to understand some subtle differences.\r\n\r\nAfter talking to @mlucy and @jdoliner, I think that in this case it's a good idea. It is a bit of a pain, but it's not a pain we're introducing for no reason. Understanding the difference here is critical because if you don't, you can seriously shoot yourself in the foot and run into all sort of performance issues (which really piss people off).\r\n\r\nWe're going to implement an array/memory limit, so the operations won't return large results -- in these cases they'll error instead, and tell people to use indexes. The tradeoff here is that adding a bit of pain for developers makes ops 10x nicer, and I think in this case it's justified."
