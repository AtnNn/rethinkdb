      "Actually, In addition to the selection/mutation concern, the other concern I have is latency/protobuf limitations. We can't currently stream arrays, so a a big GMR result or `orderBy` result will have serious latency problems or will crash protobufs if we return arrays. (A solution to this might be streaming arrays in some way, but that's what streams are for).\r\n\r\nAlso, just saw @mlucy's comment. I really like the idea of parameterized selections. This way the rule is \"you mostly get out what you put in, parameterized on what we use internally\". This makes a lot of sense to me. I'm still concerned about latency of things like GMR though and potential protobuf issues with sending huge arrays."
