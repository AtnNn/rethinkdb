        "Reql tests are very very difficult to use as a developer. When something fails they don't tell you what failed. And in many cases they'll barf up a huge amount of output making it really hard to even find the backtrace of the thing that failed.\n\nThis is getting to be a very big time sink for me so I'd prefer if this was scheduled for 1.10. It's actually getting to a point where the deficiencies of the system can add full days of development time to otherwise simple things.\n"
