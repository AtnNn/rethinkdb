      "@underrun -- FYI, we're currently working on the general issue of the system overloading on certain operations, so if this is a special case of that (which seems likely), it should be fixed in 1.10.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to thank you for submitting all your issues and being so patient. It's extremely helpful! We're going through the process of stabilizing Rethink at higher scales and working on performance and scalability issues, and the sorts of issues you're reporting are helping immensely with guiding/testing this work.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you fill out http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/ (assuming you haven't already) we'd love to send you a t-shirt and some goodies for your troubles!"
