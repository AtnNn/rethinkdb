      "@underrun -- FYI, rethinkdb automatically creates four of what we call \"hash shards\" under the hood. So a single user-visible shard is actually four shards underneath. If you want to max out CPU and you have 16 cores, I'd suggest having four shards instead of 16, FYI.\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks for reporting all the issues and being patient while we work these out! We're just starting on performance and scalability issues now, so I suspect all these issues will go away before end of year."
