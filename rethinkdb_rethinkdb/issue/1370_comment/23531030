      "Wait, the web interface is going to time out if the request to `/ajax` times out not if a query doesn't comes back in 5 seconds. The reason the web interface get disconnected is because the call to `/ajax` fails.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe http connection times out between 5 and 10 minutes thought (the server kill the connection). That's the real limit -- that I think I can fix by firing some random query instead of reconnecting."
