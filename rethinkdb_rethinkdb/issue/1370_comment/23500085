      "thanks guys, i appreciate your help looking into all this. the machine i'm running on also has a mongo instance handling a heavy load in terms of processing and IO. it's not swapping though rethinkdb is currently using 25GB of ram, and i'm running 16 shards (1 per core) for my tables on the one machine. \r\n\r\nif i reduce load on the machine it does speed up, but even under a moderate load its on the order of seconds (right now it's consistently 4 seconds). definitely seems highly correlated to load though.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner there are a number of queries i can do in the dataexplorer that time out - my table is about 7M docs and if i try to do a groupedMapReduce (even a simple count distinct) it will time out. i have to use the python interpreter for any real playing around with the data (which is a shame because i love the pop attribute lists and function signatures - they are a very good learning aide)."
