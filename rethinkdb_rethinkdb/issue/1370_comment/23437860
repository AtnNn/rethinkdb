      "I think the most likely case is overload like we've seen in other issues.  10 minutes sounds excessive, but 25 seconds is certainly plausible.  If the query hits multiple cores, it will take as long as the longest coroutine queue, which can hit tens of seconds during backfilling, maybe the same can happen during sindex post-construction.  It all really depends on the size of the queues, they kind of work they're doing, and the speed of the machine.  If the machine goes into swap, it could probably increase this time dramatically."
