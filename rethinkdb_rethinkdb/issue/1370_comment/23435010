      "So I just went through the index creation code and I can't see anyway that function could take a long time to return. I think the most likely explanation here is that the first index creation timed out because the http coro didn't get scheduled quick enough. I think that's an issue we've seen before in other forms. @underrun can you get this timeout to consistently reproduce? If so can you try some other queries in the dataexplorer and see if those timeout too?"
