      "@underrun -- just to make sure I understand, you get the expected behavior reasonably quickly with 1 shard?\r\n\r\nIf so, I'd like to close this issue as a manifestation of #1350 (which will probably be fixed in 1.10).\r\n\r\nAs @coffeemug noted, 4 shards instead of 16 should give all your cores something to do.  (And thanks for reporting this!  Knowing the specific scalability problems people are running into makes our jobs a lot easier.)"
