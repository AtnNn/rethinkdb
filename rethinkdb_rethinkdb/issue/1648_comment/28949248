      "Turns out one single copy operation in the `network_logger_t` was responsible for about half of the CPU time. I changed that to a non-copy operation.\r\n\r\nNew times for 200 tables, 32 nodes:\r\n```\r\nTime create: 2765.5682086945 ms\r\nTime drop: 312.77718544006 ms\r\nCombined: 3078.3453941345 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point, none of the CPU cores is actually maxed out. There is a fair amount of i/o waiting, and part of it is probably just latency of nodes waiting on each other."
