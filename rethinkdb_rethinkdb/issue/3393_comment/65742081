      "@mlucy I think that interface would be useful, though possibly a little unsafe.\r\nOne would have to be careful not to call it *after* the auto_drainer_t has finished destructing.\r\nI might be missing something, but as far as I can see you can be sure that this olds only if you know that we (or our caller) already hold a lock on the drainer. This poses the question though why we want to create a new lock in the first place."
