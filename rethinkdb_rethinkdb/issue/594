        "Currently our secondary indexes don't support compound indexes. The way to do compound indexes is to pass an index function which returns an array, however right now this crashes the server. This is a fairly shallow problem actually it's just that `print_primary` doesn't have a way to convert an array into a `store_key_t`.\n\nIf we just update `print_primary` this will mean that arrays can now be used as primary keys as well. This wouldn't be the end of the world but we probably don't want to do it because primary keys are going to have a hard (and somewhat stringent) limit on their length which will be easy to hit with arrays.\n"
