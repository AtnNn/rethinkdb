      "We removed it because:\r\n\r\n* It wasn't very good in the first place\r\n* It required maintaining the JS server (which we're killing because it's too much work)\r\n* It was becoming progressively more out of date with the current ReQL spec\r\n* It needs to be replaced by a proper shell\r\n\r\nAs for the broken links -- sorry, both me and @mglukhovsky missed them. It's fixed in rethinkdb-www master, someone just needs to pushed the site (I can't do it because jekyll is broken on my machine at the moment)."
