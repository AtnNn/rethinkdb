      "Hi @icesmurf ,\r\n\r\nfor supporting this, the first step is going to be allowing replicas to replicate their data from a non-primary replicas. I vaguely remember seeing a previous issue about this, but I can't find it right now.\r\nSecondly, we will need the replicas to either be explicitly aware of DC boundaries, or to use some sort of adaptive metric (e.g. latency times) to pick the \"best\" replica to backfill from.\r\n\r\nWe're working on some important features for the next few releases, so I think this is something that we will look into maybe after 2.4."
