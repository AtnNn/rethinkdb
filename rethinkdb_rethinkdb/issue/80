        "* get binary builds for every Ubuntu starting 10.04 and higher\n* integrate native os x build into an installer (homebrew, or native, or macports, etc.)\n* Host binary packages for debian/mint (I believe mint users can already run apt-get install -- correct?)\n* Host binary packages for rpm/yum\n* Add packages for 32-bit systems, once Sam is done with the 32 bit port\n* Improve the build system.\n* Chain os x build so that anyone could build rethink on os x system by running a single command\n\nI'm purposely not assigning priorities here because things are volatile. Let's use a greedy algorithm and pick stuff to work on as things get done."
