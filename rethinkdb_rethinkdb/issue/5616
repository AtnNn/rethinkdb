        "A number of tests have been occasionally producing errors because of `table.wait` timing out on them. When I look at the logs for the servers involved I see a lot of `Raft election timed out.` notices, sometimes repeating for 30-40 seconds.\r\n\r\nSome of this is probably because we are using 3 servers, so with one out of commission (as is done in the tests), there is about an even chance of deadlock in voting. However, I would contend that this is going to be a fairly common configuration in the wild, so it is one that we should be optimizing for. We should probably alter the election so that we rig those elections in some manner so we get resolution sooner.\r\n\r\nI should note that these failures are happening while multiple tests are running simultaneously, so there is extra load on the systems. However, that might well be the same sort of stress people's servers are under when they need failover to work quickly."
