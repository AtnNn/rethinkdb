      "Tested with a single table with two shards in a cluster with 3 release-mode servers using 128 clients over 100 seconds.  First tested on rows with no times, then on rows with times using commit 37d5e20 (after dates merge) and c67d499 (before dates merge).  All numbers are in ops/sec.\r\n\r\n\r\n| Operations                | 37d5e20 - no time           | 37d5e20 - with time       | c67d499  - no time         |\r\n| :-----------------------------: | -----------------------------------: | ---------------------------------: | ----------------------------------: |\r\n| writes only                | 8300                               | 6500                            | 8500                            |\r\n| 3 reads to every write | 10300 reads, 3400 writes | 7800 reads, 2600 writes | 9200 reads, 3100 writes |\r\n\r\nNote that the rdb rows with time are strictly larger and are expected to involve more work than in the other cases, so that accounts for some performance drop.  All in all, it would appear that dates have a minor impact on performance, and certainly have not impacted the general performance case."
