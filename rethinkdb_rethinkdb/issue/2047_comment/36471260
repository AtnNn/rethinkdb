      "@srh Thanks for all the info! Just one more question, if \r\n```\r\nr.ISO8601('2013-08-09T18:53:15.012+00:00')\r\n```\r\noutputs\r\n```\r\nFri Aug 09 2013 19:53:15 GMT+00:00\r\n```\r\nHow can I take that same format and turn it back into ISO8601? I ask because I'm using NoBrainer ORM. I know it's not the main project, but I ask for two reasons:\r\n1. r.ISO8601 returns this format\r\n2. This is what's inserted into the database when using timestamps in the ORM\r\n\r\nEverything in RethinkDB has been incredible so far, and I'm going through all the code to get a better grasp to be able to contribute. The one thing I'm really stuck on is dates.\r\n\r\nMy end goal here is to be able to take a created_at column and group by the day, month, and year of rows with the \"Fri Aug 09 2013 19:53:15 GMT+00:00\" format.\r\n\r\nThanks again, \r\nBob"
