      "I tried to reproduce with Ubuntu 12.10 in VirtualBox and could not.\r\n\r\n@karlgrz could try the following\r\n- Open chromium\r\n- Open the console (ctrl + maj + j)\r\n- Click on Console (on the right)\r\n- Go to 127.0.0.1:8080\r\n- Click on \"Tables\"\r\n\r\nIf there is a javascript error that stop the interface from loading the tables, it should appear in the console.\r\n\r\nSo if you can click on \"Servers\" and see the url changing it means that we are not stuck in an infinite loop.\r\nThere is no reason why the web UI would interfere with Chromium menu.\r\n\r\nAlso, did you compile from source? What version of RethinkDB and Chromium are you using?"
