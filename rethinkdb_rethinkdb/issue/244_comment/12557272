      "The `Port error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.\" is an error produced by one of your Chrome extension. It may be the reason why the interface is broken.\r\n\r\nCould you try to connect to the web interface without extension? \r\nOpening the private mode should start an instance of Chrome without extension (Ctrl + Maj+ N). If there are some extension left, you can deactivate them on Menu > Tools > Extensions.\r\n\r\nIf that works, could you tell me the chrome extensions you are using? I don't recognize all the icons. Thanks!"
