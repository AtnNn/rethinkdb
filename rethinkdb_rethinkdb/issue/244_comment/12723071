      "I spent some time with @karlgrz on Skype to figure out what's broken.\r\nSo first thank you Karl for your time (and for installing Skype)!\r\n\r\nThen what I've seen is that\r\n- window.router.$container is properly defined\r\n- Nothing catches errors, so they do appear in the JavaScript console\r\n- window.router.index_namespaces() did return the expected value\r\n- window.router.current_view was the expected view (NamespaceView.DatabaseList)\r\n- window.router.$container did contain the good view\r\n\r\nwhich means that everything was working fine on the JavaSript side and that Chromium failed to render the new DOM.\r\nSo I would tend to blame Chromium for this bug especially since the whole tab freeze after about 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nAccessing the web interface through Chrome on Windows was working, and using Firefox in the VM was working fine too.\r\n\r\nI'm closing it for now.\r\nIf someone comes with the same bug again, I'll reopen it and try to reproduce/find the bug one more time, but so far I couldn't with a Ubuntu 12.10 VM on OSX (with VirtualBox).\r\n"
