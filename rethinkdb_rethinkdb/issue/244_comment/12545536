      "Sorry for the delay, I was on vacation.\r\n\r\nI've attached screenshots to show what happens after 1 click, then what happens after I maximize the window and click another button. Each time the URL appears to be updating, but the window is just in a stuck state, don't know how else to describe it but the image should.\r\n\r\nI did NOT compile from source, I installed using the ppa repo and apt-get. Likewise, I did NOT compile chromium from source, either, but installed from apt-get as well.\r\n\r\nRunning rethinkdb 1.3.2-0ubuntu1~quantal (GCC 4.7.2)...\r\nChromium Version 23.0.1271.97 Ubuntu 12.10 (23.0.1271.97-0ubuntu0.12.10.1)\r\n![Capture_1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/548140/86443/6fc8a68c-649c-11e2-8de7-104d0d57b1b6.PNG)\r\n![Capture_2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/548140/86444/78c4872e-649c-11e2-9c2b-82e7dbd663e4.PNG)\r\n\r\n"
