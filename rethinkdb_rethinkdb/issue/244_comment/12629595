      "@karlgrz could you run in a terminal these commands and tell me what is the output\r\n```\r\nchromium-browser --version\r\nrethinkdb --version\r\nuname -a\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo going to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` then replacing the url with `http://127.0.0.1:8080/#tables` is not going to refresh the page, but call the function `window.router.index_namespaces` which is equivalent to clicking on the tables link in the top bar.\r\nDoes it work if you click on data explorer or logs? Does the content change?\r\n\r\nThe only way for `window.router.index_namespaces` (the function we called when you click on `tables`) to fails when updating the page without throwing any error, would be for `this.current_view.render().el` to returned an undefined object\r\nI carefully went through the code and could not find how we could delete the el property.\r\n\r\nCould you go to this url `chrome://chrome/extensions/` and check that all the extensions are not allowed in incognito mode? Some extensions may still be active even if they don't have an icon in the toolbar.\r\nIf some extensions were allowed in incognito mode, can you deactivate them and try again?\r\nEventually, could you copy/paste all your extensions?\r\n\r\nI have tried again to reproduce your bug, but couldn't, so it's really tough to track it especially since no error are thrown in the JavaScript console.\r\nIf it's still not working, I'll try to reproduce your bug again to find it. If I still can't would you mind trying 10 minutes a Skype conversation sharing screen to try to find the source this bug?"
