        "In my system I'm using multiple rethinkdb clusters 2.2.5 with 3 instances for each cluster. Each instance of every cluster is install in one separated node same data center. Recently from one of my clusters (lets call it \"account\" cluster with 3 instance A, B, C), there are 2 instances A, B got disconnected from instance C a few times every day without any reason. The log pattern (in `log_file`) is:\n\n```\n2016-03-31T07:03:20.376800729 665564.904051s notice: Disconnected from server \"C\" 123_456\n2016-03-31T07:03:20.654819525 665565.182070s info: Rejected a connection from server 123_456 since one is open already.\n2016-03-31T07:03:20.705102839 665565.232353s info: Rejected a connection from server 123_456 since one is open already.\n2016-03-31T07:03:21.163017032 665565.690268s notice: Connected to server \"C\" 123_456\n...\n2016-03-31T08:06:06.027032835 669330.554286s notice: Disconnected from server \"C\" 123_456\n2016-03-31T08:06:06.049267707 669330.576519s info: Rejected a connection from server 123_456 since one is open already.\n2016-03-31T08:06:06.194287878 669330.721537s info: Rejected a connection from server 123_456 since one is open already.\n2016-03-31T08:06:06.484053317 669331.011305s notice: Connected to server \"C\" 123_456\n...\n```\n\nIt happened for only ~1s, few times everyday. There was no log that explain the cause (such as `Heartbeat timeout`). And there was no related log in `dmesg -T` either.\n\nThe weird thing is that I don't have this issue in other clusters which are running in same machines\n\nConfiguration info:\n\nNode A and node B are VMs under Hyper-V: `CoreOS 773.1.0`, they are running in two physical machines but same data center. Same subnet.\n\n```\n$ uname -a\nLinux coreos-data-3 4.1.5-coreos #2 SMP Thu Aug 13 09:18:45 UTC 2015 x86_64 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 0 @ 2.30GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux\n\n$ docker version\nClient version: 1.7.1\nClient API version: 1.19\nGo version (client): go1.4.2\nGit commit (client): 2c2c52b-dirty\nOS/Arch (client): linux/amd64\nServer version: 1.7.1\nServer API version: 1.19\nGo version (server): go1.4.2\nGit commit (server): 2c2c52b-dirty\nOS/Arch (server): linux/amd64\n```\n\nNode C is a different physical machine (different subnet.) running bare metal `CoreOS 835.12.0` with two NICs behind bonding network.

As I found no specific log about the cause, I have no way to trace the issue.\n"
