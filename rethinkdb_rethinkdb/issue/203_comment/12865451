      "Here's what's happening:\r\n\r\nWhen a tcp connection is closed and we get `poll_event_hup`, we shutdown the reading end of the connection if we're currently \"reading,\" and we shutdown the writing end of the connection if we're currently \"writing\".\r\n\r\nThis uses the shutdown(2) syscall.\r\n\r\nThen we keep getting `poll_event_hup` events over and over again in a loop because we didn't close the socket, we only shutdown the reading end, because the network api is completely broken!\r\n"
