      "Ok, this has been approved and merged into `v1.13.x` in commit 29eccf2.  `next` no longer exhibited this issue due to @srh's changes.  Review was 1665.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I noticed that there was a memory leak in the extprocs, which is solved by commit 81402c9 in `v1.13.x` and `next`.  This appears to be due to us never telling V8 that it is ok to do garbage collection.\r\n\r\nWill be in release 1.13.1."
