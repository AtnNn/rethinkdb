      "Trying to reproduce this now.  Nothing on `newton`, trying on OSX.  I'm worried this is because of a mismatch with the installed version of V8, but no proof yet.  Since this works on `newton`, I doubt it's a problem resulting from the specific `r.js` code.\r\n\r\nThis issue is particularly worrying because the extprocs should not be able to result in a crash in the main process.  @brettgriffin, can you confirm that this crashed the main `rethinkdb` process, and not just a worker process?  The only thing that should possibly be able to cause that is a serialization desynchronization between the main and worker processes.\r\n\r\nAlso, that backtrace looks like complete nonsense to me, so it would be really nice if I can reproduce."
