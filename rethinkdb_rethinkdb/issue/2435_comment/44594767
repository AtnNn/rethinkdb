      "@brettgriffin, was the crash observed when you ran the query in the web UI (i.e. the Data Explorer)?  I have reproduced a crash in that situation (which exists in both `next` and `v1.12.x`, and is fairly easy to reproduce).\r\n\r\nIf not, could you provide some more information from the crash report?  There should be a few lines above what you pasted, such as 'Assertion failed...' or 'Segmentation fault', which would be useful to see."
