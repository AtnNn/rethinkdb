      "@neumino, checking the version of v8 that we run with is actually pretty difficult, as far as I can tell.  What @bgriffinbl pasted above actually just shows the version of v8 that node comes with.\r\n\r\n@bgriffinbl, I'm still working on this, it's very reproducible.  The problem is that it is surprisingly hard to debug this sort of problem (and I was distracted by work for the 1.13 release).\r\n\r\nAs it stands currently, this error seems to happen because the interruptor on the http connection is being destroyed while something else still has a subscription to it.  I am working on finding out what exactly has the open subscription and why is hasn't been unsubscribed yet."
