        "The drivers should timeout if the rethink instance does not respond back in time. Ruby already has this by default, but the javascript and python drivers need a timeout added. This is needed with the introduction of basic auth since both client and sever now expect an extra round trip they will hang waiting for a response that's not coming.\r\n\r\nRuby's default behavior is to timeout after 20 seconds which seems reasonable and should probably be the same for the other drivers."
