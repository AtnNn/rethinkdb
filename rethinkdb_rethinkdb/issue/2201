I had to wait til the two servers were in sync with empty data sets before i started the two imports and set a --force on one of the imports.\n```\n\n`table_create()` does use `wait_for_rdb_table_readiness()` internally to make sure that it doesn't return before the table is accessible. So this shouldn't happen.\n"
