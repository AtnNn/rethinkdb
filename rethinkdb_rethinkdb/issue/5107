        "Hello, \r\n\r\nI am trying to build autoscaling for my rethinkdb cluster. I've scripted the entire process on Digitalocean but all my new machines were all cloned from my third DO droplet snapshot - which has this GUID assigned by the rethinkdb process: e5aadd93-f949-4ed6-b1f1-7a78a2d40005. So every time I spin up more droplets I get this error.\r\n\r\n2015-11-17T22:56:02.993103410 121.799358s info: Rejected a connection from server e5aadd93-f949-4ed6-b1f1-7a78a2d40005 since one is open already.\r\n\r\nI've already tried setting new hostnames and manually set this option in my default.conf file as well:\r\n\r\nserver-name=server1\r\n\r\nAny idea how to change this or dynamically reassign?
