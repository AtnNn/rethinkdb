      "Thanks for the information @digipigeon .\r\nWe have seen instances of data corruption on OpenVZ before (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4750 ), so this is probably related. Did anything unusual happen before this crash first appeared (e.g. a server crash, power failure etc.)?\r\n\r\nRethinkDB relies on certain guarantees of the underlying storage system, and some virtualization environments don't correctly implement these guarantees. \r\n\r\nWhich version of OpenVZ are you using, and which file system and kernel version is running on the host system? Are you using any non-standard mount options on the host or guest system, or any special configuration for the OpenVZ container?"
