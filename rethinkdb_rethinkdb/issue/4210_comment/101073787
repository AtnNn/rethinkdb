      "Thanks for the explanation, I think I got the idea.\r\n\r\nSo for example we could allow specifying a ReQL function on a table that gets the three objects you mention as its input and then returns whether this modification is permitted or not.\r\n\r\nI actually really like this idea. It can be used for anything from access control to schema enforcement.\r\n\r\nThis covers the side of write operations. We would still need to cover read operations. Maybe that could happen in a similar way, by defining a function on a table that determines which documents can be read by a given user and which cannot.\r\n\r\nFor security, we would in addition have to restrict certain terms. Most importantly `r.http` and things like `reconfigure`."
