      "So, imagine a rule that says \"the `a` field needs to be less than the `c` field\" and an update comes in that increases the `a` field, and another update comes in at the same time decreasing the value of the `c` field. Both may independently pass the rule, but without the db guaranteeing atomicity, the document in the database may violate the rule.\r\n\r\nI think current document only would be fine"
