      "Cross-document logic enforcement would be very hard to do as far as I can tell.\r\nThis is because RethinkDB doesn't support cross-document transactions and thus we would either have to sacrifice atomicity of an update or would need to hold write locks over extended periods while looking up information from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHow critical are cross-table functions @cayblood?"
