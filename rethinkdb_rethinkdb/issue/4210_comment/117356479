      "Thanks for the additional feedback @pagejohn and @cayblood .\r\n\r\nI think simple cases of cross-table rules might be possible. For example checking a user record in another table doesn't necessarily require the check to be atomic. We won't be able to guarantee atomicity for cross-table rules, but I think this will be fine for many use cases, though not all."
