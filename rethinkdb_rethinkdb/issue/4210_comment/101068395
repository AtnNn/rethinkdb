      "Hi @cayblood, thank you for the suggestion.\r\n\r\nWe've been planning to add user accounts and per-user privileges to RethinkDB (either directly or as an external proxy), see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/218 . We don't have the feature scheduled yet, but it's definitely on our short list of features to add.\r\n\r\nWhich types of security rules would be most important for you?"
