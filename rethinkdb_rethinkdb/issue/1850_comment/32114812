      "I definitely agree we have pressing performance problems, and that some (many?) people are using noreply writes because we don't offer easy asynchronous behavior.  We should fix both of those.\r\n\r\nI don't agree that this means we should get rid of noreply writes.  They have a real use case, especially when your client and server aren't hooked up to the same switch, and other similar systems provide them (e.g. Mongo has the \"Unacknowledged\" write concern: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/write-concern/ ).  Since noreply writes are already implemented, and people are using them, I find it hard to justify removing them.  I'd rather just write the drivers correctly so that they don't impact normal behavior."
