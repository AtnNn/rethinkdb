      "@mlucy \r\nAbout 1: The semantics you mention can be guaranteed in other ways. Also, just to clarify: That point wasn't really meant as a reason not to implement the future/promise semantics in the clients now. I totally agree that it makes sense even without the change in the server. (I later edited my post above to clarify this, not sure if you had seen that)\r\n\r\nAbout 2: Yes. I'm not familiar enough with Python to know how easy or difficult that is. Might be easy. I definitely know that it is impossible in PHP without using special libraries for async i/o (there simply is no support for multi-threading). In the worst case some drivers might just not implement the async API mentioned here, which probably would be ok."
