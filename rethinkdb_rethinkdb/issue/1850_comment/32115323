      "about your 2. concern, if your language support threading, then you are covered (like the ruby driver). If your language is on top of a reactor pattern, then you have no issues because you are async by design. Other languages with no threading or concurrency mechanism might need a C extension.\r\n\r\nabout 3. Not necessarily because responses could be parsed lazily. The dispatcher just need to read the token+message length and push it to the future object. only when calling `value` the actual protobuf is parsed. This is doable, because the `repeated Datum response = 3;` in the Response message contains its length on the wire. The socket data is then garbage collected if the user doesn't call `value`."
