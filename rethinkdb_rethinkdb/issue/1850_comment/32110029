      "I forgot, If we want both promises and futures, we could do:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nresult_future = rql_query.run(c, :async => :future)\r\nresult_promise = rql_query.run(c, :async => :promise)\r\n\r\nresult_future.value['attr'] # waits for the query to complete explicitly and return the result\r\nresult_promise['attr'] # waits for the query to complete only when we try to access the data in result.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we want to provide both, or one or the other, or which one should be the default when ran with `:async => true`"
