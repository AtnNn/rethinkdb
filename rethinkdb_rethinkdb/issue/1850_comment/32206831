      "Sorry, I'm late to the party. A few thoughts:\r\n\r\n* I love this API. When we have the opportunity, I think we should implement this.\r\n* I agree with @nviennot that we should drop `noreply` in favor of this API. I never liked `noreply`, and its main purpose has always been to let people stress the write throughput of the server without having to deal with network roundtrips and pipeline bottlenecks introduces by collecting batches. \r\n\r\nI'd like to wait until we have the resources to do it in all drivers, so I'm moving to backlog for now."
