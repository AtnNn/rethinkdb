      "I was proposing this feature to be able to queue reads and get them later. For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nuser = r.table('users').get('user_id').run(c, :async => true)\r\nproject = r.table('projects').get('project_id').run(c, :async => true)\r\nuser = user.value\r\nproject = project.value\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbout the throwaway replies: aside from looking better in benchmarks, I wouldn't think that it's a desirable feature to be maintained."
