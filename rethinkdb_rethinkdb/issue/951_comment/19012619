      "While the idea of reminding people that they are using outdated drivers is a noble one, I think the protocol magic should only be changed when changes are introduced that break *existing* features of old drivers.\r\n\r\nThe renaming of the hard_durability option in 1.6 would be a candidate for such a compatibility-breaking change, but I don't think it is a very important one.\r\n\r\nIn general, it is nice from an administrational point of view if you can first update the server, and then follow up with a driver update at a later time.\r\n\r\nPS: If the changes in reduce and contains break existing drivers, than I guess the magic should indeed be changed."
