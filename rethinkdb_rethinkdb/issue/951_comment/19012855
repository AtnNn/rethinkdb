      "What's the change to `reduce`?\r\n\r\nThe change to `contains` won't break existing drivers because I gave `has_fields` the number `contains` used to have in the protobuf spec.  (Or rather, it will only be slightly incorrect because `has_fields` has subtly different behavior.)\r\n\r\nI think we should only bump the number for serious breaking changes, but I could be convinced otherwise.\r\n\r\n(Also, right now the failure mode when the magic number is wrong is really bad.  @Tryneus is going to fix this as part of adding API key support.)"
