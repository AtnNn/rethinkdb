      "Would you be OK with using `connected`/`disconnected` whenever we refer to servers? So it would be something like this:\r\n* In `server_status`, the `status` field can have values `\"connected\"` and `\"disconnected\"`.\r\n* In `table_status`, the `status` field is `\"disconnected\"` for a replica that's disconnected.\r\n* In `issues`, the issue `type` field can be `server_disconnected`, and the message is `Server %s is disconnected from these servers...`\r\n* \"Availability\" is a property of primary/secondary replicas and tables. It's equivalent to being able to handle queries."
