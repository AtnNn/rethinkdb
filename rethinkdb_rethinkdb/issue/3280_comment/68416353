      "Oh I didn't realize we want to apply these same terms to replicas as well and not just servers.\r\n\r\nI don't think \"unreachable\" works for replicas, because it's very unclear (to me at least) what that means. Does it mean that the server hosting the replica is unreachable? That's probably not what we mean by it.\r\n\r\nI would use `unavailable` / `available` for replicas, and `unreachable`/`connected` for servers."
