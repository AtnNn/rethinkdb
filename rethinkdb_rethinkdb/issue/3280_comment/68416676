      "If a server is down, what should `table_status` say? Would you use `\"unreachable\"` or `\"unavailable\"` in that case? I actually kind of like `\"disconnected\"`, because it makes it clearer that the problem is at the network level, and not internal to RethinkDB.\r\n\r\nIf a replica is reachable but backfilling, is it \"available\"?"
