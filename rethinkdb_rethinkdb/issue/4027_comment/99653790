      "The rest of the tests are updated, and in review with CR 2856. This introduces a few changes to what we have had before:\r\n- `test-runner` now looks for files with the extension `.mocha` and runs them with the [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) test framework with no intermediate `.test` file needed.\r\n- all of the `connections` JavaScript tests except `http.js` now use Mocha.\r\n- There are a number of additional tests mixed in, especially in testing changefeed EventEmitters."
