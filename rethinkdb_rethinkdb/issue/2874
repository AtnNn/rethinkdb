        "Currently, server names and server tags (see #2856) are specified on the command line when the server is first started, and persisted across restarts. We should consider requiring the user to re-specify them every time the server is started.\n\nIf we don't persist them, we should choose the default name in such a way that it will usually be chosen the same if the user stops the server and restarts it.\n\nIf we do persist them, we should modify the `rethinkdb` porcelain such that it errors if `--machine-name` or `--server-tag` are used after the initial run. Alternatively, we could let these flags override the old values if used after the initial run.\n\nThis might be related to getting rid of `rethinkdb create` and `rethinkdb serve` (#2714).\n"
