        "I wrote a python script to load a CSV (about 4.4 million rows) and transform it from a flat denormalized structure to a nested document structure.  After about 18k rows, I'm getting the following error.  When I visually look at the data, I don't see any problem.  When I try to find the referenced character via grep (grep \"\\xef\") I cannot find it either.  Anyone else encounter this problem and have some troubleshooting tips?\r\n\r\n    return c._start(self, **global_optargs)\r\n\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rethinkdb/net.py\", line 228, in _start\r\n\r\n    return self._send_query(query, global_optargs)\r\n\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rethinkdb/net.py\", line 320, in _send_query\r\n    query_str = query.serialize().encode('utf-8')\r\n\r\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xef in position 125455: ordinal not in range(128)\r\n\r\nData file and script located here:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/diwcal9u6jy2qj4/AABOkhRy88MTZIq5GiEx8yxka?dl=0\r\n"
