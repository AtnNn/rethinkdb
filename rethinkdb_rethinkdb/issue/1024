        "Currently, the `vector_clock_conflict_issue_tracker_t` only works on the cluster_semilattice_metadata, but this should be expanded to include auth_semilattice_metadata.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it appears that 'resolve auth' also isn't working, which sucks, but it should be possible to work around it with 'unset auth' and 'set auth'."
