      "I spent a some time on this with no luck. It took me a while to figure out why. Many of the dependencies require other dependencies to be in the global namespace. For example, Backbone requires Underscore to be in the global namespace, and Cubism requires D3 to be global as well.\r\n\r\nI'm very confused by this behavior. In all of my npm projects, dependencies always install their own dependencies. I've never encountered this behavior with npm before, nor could I find a reason why it's happening.\r\n\r\nThe only solution I can come up with is to do something like ```global.dependency = require('dependency')``` near the top (app.coffee?) but that is an inelegant solution and pretty much negates the whole purpose of ```require```. I'm not sure what the best way to solve this is.\r\n"
