      "@bnosrat Thanks for looking at this! I ran into the backbone issue as well when testing something out on requirebin. The solution I found was using the package \"backbone-node\" (I think), it's packaged specifically so it'll work with browserify. I don't know of other packages that do this, but hopefully there are browserify-safe versions for those"
