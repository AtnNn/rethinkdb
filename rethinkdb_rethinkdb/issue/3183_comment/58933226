      "@timmaxw do you think this would be easy to do?\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the `durability` default on tables I believe we would have to store this one in the cluster-wide metadata (or in the directory), since the parsing node needs to know where to route a given query depending on what the value of the use outdated ok flag is.\r\n\r\nI think this might be something that we could tackle in combination with https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1859 ."
