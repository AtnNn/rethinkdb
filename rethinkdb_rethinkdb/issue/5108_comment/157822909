      "@springrider Can you try passing the `--clients 1` parameter to `rethinkdb dump`?\r\nYou might also want to upgrade to the latest release of the Python driver (`sudo pip install --upgrade rethinkdb`). It has some improvements to `rethinkdb dump`'s memory consumption.\r\n\r\nCould you also check the RethinkDB log file and see if there's another line above the `report_fatal_error` line?\r\n\r\nAre you using `r.http` in your queries (just asking because the crash appeared to happen when RethinkDB tried to spawn a process to process an HTTP request)?"
