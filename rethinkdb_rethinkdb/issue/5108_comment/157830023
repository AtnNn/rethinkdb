      "Also opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5110 to make us survive failures to spawn an external helper process (we use those for `r.http` and for `r.js`). However this will not be part of the server before at least RethinkDB 2.3, so we should try to find another way until then."
