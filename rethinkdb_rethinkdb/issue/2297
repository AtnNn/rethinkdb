        "We still use `protobufjs` in `proto-def.js`.\r\n\r\nIt's fine since we use it just to build an object with all the constants, but if we want to keep `protobufjs`, we should put it back in `package.json` (sorry @Tryneus, I asked you in the review to remove it ^_^)\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to commit the object built by `protobufjs` (yup I know, it's bad) or we could have the Makefile build it.\r\n\r\nI think it's ok to keep the protobufjs dependency in this case.\r\nAny objection if I put it back in `package.json`?\r\n\r\nPing @Tryneus @atnnn "
