      "That's annoying, because it opens the door for a trivial DoS attack and makes everything remotely analytic fragile (user stores extremely large or small value(s) into a table -> analytical queries break for the whole table).\r\n\r\nSure, having an inf or NaN doesn't exactly help if you want to compute an average or sum over the whole table. But at least you can still do a `map()` without an error being thrown, and it is easier to find out which document is causing the problem.\r\n\r\nIt seems somewhat independent of this though. I'll open a separate issue."
