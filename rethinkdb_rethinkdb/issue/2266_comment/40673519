      "I wonder if it's actually a good idea that we disallow inf an NaN in ReQL.\r\nIf somebody wants to do calculation on user-provided data it would be extremely annoying to have users explicitly check that everything is in double range.\r\n\r\nFor example this query just fails, with no obvious way to catch and handle the error:\r\n```\r\nr.expr(1).div(0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001).div(0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001).div(0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001)\r\n\r\nRqlRuntimeError: Non-finite number: inf in:\r\nr(1).div(1e-96).div(1e-154).div(1e-154)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think we should allow both NaN and inf, though I'm not sure how these are usually encoded in JSON."
