      "It's fixed in `michel_1060_dataexplorer_comments`.\r\nI'll run a little more tests on Monday before opening the code review.\r\n\r\nThe fix removes the comments before splitting the queries, so in case of an error, the broken query returned is the one without comment. I'll think a little more about it and may provide a \"better\" fix."
