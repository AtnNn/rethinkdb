        "There are files that are unused anywhere in `test/common`. To make life easier these should be removed. The following are on the hit-list as a `git grep` for them returns nothing, as does looking for the functions inside them:\r\n\r\n- [ ] `corrupter.py`\r\n- [ ] `git_util.py`\r\n- [ ] `procutil.py`\r\n- [ ] `rdbstat.py` 0 may have bend used by `test/long_test/statsDBCollector.py`\r\n\r\nAdditionally while looking for these files I found that all three of the files in `test/long_test` are not referenced anywhere, and are likely broken at this point [`statsDBCollector.py`, `statsPlotter.py`, `webPlotter.py`]. Likely the first one is what used `rdbstat.py`, but the import statement is broken at this point.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any objections to these going away? I especially want feedback about the `test/long_test` folder."
