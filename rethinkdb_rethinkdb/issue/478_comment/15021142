      "* Is there any common code other than the hot-patch?\r\n* There aren't any \"load\" statements in import_export.rb.\r\n* The fact that the old ruby driver isn't in our source tree (and is hard-coded into the script) is not a problem.\r\n* Changing the connection logic in an old driver doesn't cause any problems with autogenerating this file.  The only place the old driver exists is for import_export.rb or for the generation script."
