      "It's not immediately clear to me that this is a good idea, for several reasons:\r\n\r\n* There's some code common to multiple drivers that should be present only once in import_export.rb (like the hack to hot-patch ruby_protobuf for compatibility with Ruby 1.8.7 on some versions of OS X).\r\n* There's some code present in the drivers that needs to not be present in import_export.rb (like all the `load` statements).\r\n* Some of the code in import_export.rb is no longer in our source tree (like the old ruby driver, which is gone).\r\n* We might well want to add custom patches to import_export.rb in the future.  For example, we may want to change the connection logic in an old driver to make sure we detect errors when connecting to a new server.\r\n\r\nBasically, autogenerating the script is more complicated than just concatenating a bunch of files.  Also, updating the script manually should be fairly rare/easy."
