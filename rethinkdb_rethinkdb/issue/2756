        "If a network paration occures but at least  one node is able to brige the other part of the network or somehow all hows are able to conenct to all other hosts they just cant take a direct route messages and commands should be able to route between other nodes. The perfomance of this is not what people would like but this could avoid downtime. For this to work each node will need to be aware of what every other node is able to see so even if it has direct heartbeat issue to a node directly its able to \"heartbeat\" via another node or several other nodes.\r\n\r\nThis allows for other types of connections like only having to encrypt connections between edge nodes in a dc if you want to have multi dc encryption. Also allows people to get a node on the personal computer behind a nat which could be very useful for development even as they go from home to work or coffee shops or what ever they would still connect.\r\n\r\nWould help avoid: #2755"
