        "On Ubuntu 16.04 w/rethinkdb 2.3.4 (checked 2.1.0 as well) rethinkdb will take 43 seconds to initialize if a DNS server is unresponsive or unreachable. \r\n\r\nI could not see any hint of this in the logs as they simply started logging at 43 seconds, but when running with `strace` noticed continuous timeouts connecting to an IP which was apparently a DNS which had become unreachable. \r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n1. resolv.conf also had a working DNS configured to which rethinkdb connected fine (as per `strace`)\r\n2. Running rethinkdb w/`--no-update-check` had no effect\r\n\r\nObviously our course of action is to deprovision this DNS server until it's back up - but it seems suboptimal that rethinkdb will take 45 seconds to initialize when at least one configured DNS is not available (especially given that no configuration was passed to mandate a DNS and, perhaps moreover, a working DNS was available)."
