        "@nviennot's pull requests inspired me to look at ruby driver performance a bit more, and I don't think we can really make the driver fast until we move off of it's protobuf library.\n\nI've looked, and there doesn't seem to be a better one available.  I think the best option right now would be to add a JSON API to the server.  (This will also allow third-party driver writers without access to fast protobuf libraries to benefit.)\n\nPutting in subsequent and tagging as `lts`.\n"
