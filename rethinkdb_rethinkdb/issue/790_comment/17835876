      "So the bug was indeed because we were passing directly false to the handlebars template.\r\nIt's fixed in commit aaddc6363a77fd905c726456759a5780076bd5ff, branch `michel_790_false_values`.\r\nCode review 532.\r\n\r\nI also found another bug for primitive value in the table view (r.expr(1) wasn't properly displayed).\r\nIt's also part of the fix."
