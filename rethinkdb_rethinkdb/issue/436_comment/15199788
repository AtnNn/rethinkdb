      "I'm not sure we want to merge this. This pull request improves the error messages in the driver by giving the function that threw the error in the error message. Desirable as this behavior might be this is not the behavior expected in the polyglot tests nor does it match the behavior of the other drivers. If we actually want this behavior then we need to fix the tests and the other drivers in addition to merging this pull request."
