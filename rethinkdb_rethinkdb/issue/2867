        "Hi\r\n\r\nI'm trying to dynamically name the key by the value of the object and I'm left with not-transformed names like ```var_16(\"project_id\")```.\r\nHere's an example query:\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('objects').merge(function(obj){\r\n  var retVal = {};\r\n  var name = obj(\"project_id\");\r\n  retVal[name] = r.table('projects').get(obj(\"project_id\")).coerceTo('object')('name');\r\n  return retVal;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I get is:\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n{\r\n\"id\":  \"95d72952-920f-4a4b-9698-70981ee5d593\" ,\r\n\"name\":  \"contact\" ,\r\n\"project_id\":  \"b80587bd-fa43-4382-87cf-13200b1853c1\" ,\r\n\"var_16(\"project_id\")\":  \"test\"\r\n}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat should be the output though is - that last key-value pair instead of being: \r\n```\"var_16(\"project_id\")\":  \"test\"``` should say ```\"b80587bd-fa43-4382-87cf-13200b1853c1\":  \"test\"```\r\n\r\nOf course what I'm doing here doesn't really make sense in reality, but I was trying to achieve something else, and I stumbled upon this as a byproduct.\r\n\r\nIf this is not a bug, please let me know.\r\nThanks! I'm really happy about what you're doing, RethinkDB is really a wonderful tool!\r\n\r\nTake care,\r\nNIXin"
