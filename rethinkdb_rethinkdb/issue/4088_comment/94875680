      "Hi @RaitoBezarius, the problem I think is this ulimit:\r\n`Maximum number of processes available to a single user (-u) 40`\r\nCan you increase it and try again?\r\n\r\nAbout the \"Inaccessible database file\" error: This is a consequence of the previous rethinkdb instance leaving behind an only partially initialized data directory. I recommend deleting the `rethinkdb_data` directory and trying again."
