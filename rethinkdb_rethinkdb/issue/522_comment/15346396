      "The fix for this will likely finish code review and be put into a point release next week.  (@mglukhovsky, is that feasible?)\r\n\r\n@fourlincoln10 -- in the meantime, a workaround is to write `r.db('test').table('users').orderBy('username').coerce_to('array').skip(1)` instead of `r.db('test').table('users').orderBy('username').skip(1)`.  This will have worse performance, but should work well enough until the point release."
