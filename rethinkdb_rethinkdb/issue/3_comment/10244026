      "Thanks for looking.\r\n\r\nYes, it's consistent. I tried deleting the folder. I tried running under sudo, etc.. \r\n\r\nThis is also VirtualBox with Minn 13 upgraded to latest versions of packages. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to enable debug or something like that? Or something I can provide that will give a hint of what's going on? Like strace, core dump or something?"
