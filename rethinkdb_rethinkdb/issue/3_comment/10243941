      "Hi Slava, our current status when investigating this bug is that we've created a Linux Mint 13 VM inside of VirtualBox (with the same uname -a string except for machine name) and failed to reproduce the problem.  The server starts up normally.\r\n\r\nThis is on a fresh installation of Linux Mint 13, running in a VirtualBox VM on a Ubuntu 12.04 host (running on an i7-2760QM on some Intel 330 or 520 SSD), the filesystem being ext4, no weird installation options.\r\n\r\nDoes this behavior happen consistently for you?\r\n"
