        "I downloaded the [preview](https://download.rethinkdb.com/windows/rethinkdb-dev-preview-0.zip), started up a server (`.\\rethinkdb`) and in a separate CMD, ran `pip install rethinkdb` followed by `.\\rethinkdb restore file.tar.gz` and this is what I got:\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\James\\Desktop>Unzipping archive file...\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\rethinkdb-restore-script.py\", line 9, in <module>\n    load_entry_point('rethinkdb==2.2.0.post3', 'console_scripts', 'rethinkdb-restore')()\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\rethinkdb\\_restore.py\", line 191, in main\n    run_rethinkdb_import(options)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\rethinkdb\\_restore.py\", line 173, in run_rethinkdb_import\n    do_unzip(temp_dir, options)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\rethinkdb\\_restore.py\", line 129, in do_unzip\n    res = subprocess.call(tar_args)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\subprocess.py\", line 522, in call\n    return Popen(*popenargs, **kwargs).wait()\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\subprocess.py\", line 710, in __init__\n    errread, errwrite)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\subprocess.py\", line 958, in _execute_child\n    startupinfo)\nWindowsError: [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified\n```\n\nI also tried using the relative path instead of just the filename (i.e. `.\\file.tar.gz` instead of `file.tar.gz`) and even the full path, but none of those attempts worked. I always get the same error. So I read through the code, and realized when the error said \"cannot find the file specified\", it wasn't talking about my RethinkDB dump, it was talking about _tar_, which Windows does not come with :frowning:\n\nSo I downloaded and installed [this](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/tar-bin.php) from [Tar for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gtar.htm) to... uh... \"polyfill\" tar. And then I added the path of tar.exe to my system's PATH variable.\n\nI got another error, which started out with:\n\n> tar: unrecognized option `--strip-components=1'\n\nso I manually did the extraction, stripping out the top dir. Then I went into `_restore.py` (one of the files from the stack trace above) and replaced the unzip command on line 173 (`do_unzip(temp_dir, options)`) with a command to tell me where to put the extracted files (`raw_input(\"Extract files to: \" + temp_dir)`).\n\nI thought that all I had to do was circumvent the tar usage, and then everything would work. Unfortunately, it didn't:\n\n```\nImporting from directory...\n[                                        ]   0%\n0 rows imported in 38 tables\nReQL error during 'import': Cannot perform write: primary replica for shard [\"\", +inf) not available\nReQL error during 'import': Cannot perform write: primary replica for shard [\"\", +inf) not available\nErrors occurred during import\nError: rethinkdb-import failed\n```\n\nThe databases and tables were successfully created, but they were all empty :sob:\n\nAlso, I don't think this is an edge-case due to a huge export or anything. `file.tar.gz` is only 928KB, and although one of the tables has ~9000 documents, most have between 0 and 100\n"
