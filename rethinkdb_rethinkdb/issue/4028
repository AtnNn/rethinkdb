        "Dear All,\n\nAlthough [docs say](http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/order_by/):\n\n> Note: RethinkDB uses byte-wise ordering for orderBy and does not support Unicode collations; non-ASCII characters will be sorted by UTF-8 codepoint.\n\nIs it possible to define collate like [ Postgresql's`COLLATE 'tr_TR.UTF-8'` ](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/collation.html) so that sorting will be done correctly for languages like Turkish? ( COLLATE can be defined for a column, for a table or for DB)\n\nRegards\nErkan D.\n"
