      "Hi @AlexLuya, thanks for opening an issue here. We'll investigate this.\r\n\r\nCan you send us a copy of your RethinkDB data directory? It is probably going to compress very well if you gzip/tar it, but in case it's too big for an email, please let us know and we can set up an upload server for you.\r\n(my email: daniel at rethinkdb.com)"
