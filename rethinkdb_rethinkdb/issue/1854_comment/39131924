      "@srh as you know, we have a lot of variadic functions. `pluck()`, `withFields()` etc.\r\n`getAll()` is the only one where giving an array as an argument is ambiguous though. You can't know whether it is a key for a composite index, or a list of multiple keys. In PHP-RQL there are two commands for that very reason, `getAll()` and `getMultiple()`. As far as I know all other commands could just accept arrays as an alternative to variadic arguments."
