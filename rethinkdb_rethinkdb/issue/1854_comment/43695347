      "I deleted my previous comment because it was confusing; I was asking @danielmewes what the assumed behavior he was talking about was, not specifying the current behavior.\r\n\r\nI would rather not make `r.args(1)` and `r.args([1])` equivalent.  It gets confusing quickly when you want to pass an array as an argument."
