      "I kind of dislike the idea of special-casing `r.args` for specific functions. It makes the driver more complicated and will be difficult to maintain in the future.\r\n\r\nI think in the long term all drivers should work the way the Ruby driver works -- do as little as possible on the driver side, and pass everything to the server. It seems like the easiest way to move quickly and not break things. It comes with a cost, but I think that's acceptable."
