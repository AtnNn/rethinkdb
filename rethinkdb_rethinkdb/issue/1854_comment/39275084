      "@mlucy and I discussed this a bit more in person.\r\n\r\n- What if a driver reorders some arguments?  `r.args` behavior would be counter-intuitive there.  There's also some reordering that existing drivers do (r.do for example, and Ruby's treatment of blocks in some circumstances, which shouldn't be an issue).  Other third-party drivers might order arguments in some language-specific way... they would just have to deal with it and order them the same as the \"standard\" order.\r\n\r\n- We could (partly for this reason) only allow use of `r.args` in places where there are variadic parameter lists.  That would take effort and there doesn't seem to be a very compelling reason.\r\n\r\n- It is good that functions cannot be passed through `r.args` (partly because of the Ruby driver)."
