      "The python implementation is up in review 1480.  A few notes about the implementation:\r\n\r\n * Query terms no longer accept optargs as unnamed arguments.  This is because we need to use `*args` for most Query terms, and named arguments cannot follow `*args` (in python 2.x at least).  As a result, this may break some users' code, but the fix is very simple\r\n```py\r\nExample:\r\nr.js('stuff', 50) # Works in 1.12, broken in 1.13\r\nr.js('stuff', timeout=50) # Works in 1.12 and 1.13\r\n```\r\n\r\n* The docs we auto-generate for interactive python shells are not quite as useful anymore, now that the query functions are almost all of the format `f(*args, **kwargs)`.  As a result, I am changing the docs generation to include the function specification.\r\n"
