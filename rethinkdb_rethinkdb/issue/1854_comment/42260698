      "In the Python driver, we could allow `r.args` only in functions that take a variable number of arguments. Those are the only functions for which `r.args` is needed. This would allow keeping the function signatures as they are now. It would not break backwards compatibility and function signatures would keep the desirable property of being self-documenting.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage is that `r.args` could not be used everywhere, which differs from the behaviour of the ruby driver."
