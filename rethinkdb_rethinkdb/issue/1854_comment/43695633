      "> It's not obvious whether r.args([1, 2], [3, 4]) means r.args([1, 2, 3, 4]) or r.args([[1, 2], [3, 4]]). \r\n> I would actually tend to assume the latter.\r\n\r\nI would have say the first solution since the purpose of `r.args` is to defeat variadic methods, and since it's not common to pass two arrays as arguments in a ReQL method.\r\n\r\nBut err, this really feels like an edge case and inception-ish. Both solutions are probably ok and I couldn't find a case when one solution wouldn't work, so I'm good with anything."
