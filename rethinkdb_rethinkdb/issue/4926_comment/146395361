      "@gedw99 Do you mean this note?\r\n> Please note that this version of the driver only supports versions of RethinkDB using the v0.4 protocol (any versions of the driver older than RethinkDB 2.0 will not work).\r\n\r\nThe v0.4 protocol is actually the latest protocol. Basically this just means that the driver doesn't work with *old* versions of RethinkDB, but it works with all the current ones."
