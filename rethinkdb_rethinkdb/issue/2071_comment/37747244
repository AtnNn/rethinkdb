      "Did a few more tests and part of the problem (and possibly the cause for the heartbeat timeouts in this very write intensive scenario) is https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/265 .

It doesn't seem to be due to overly high message queue latencies though. Could be a throttling / locking issue now..."
