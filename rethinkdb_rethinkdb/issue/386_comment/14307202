      "Unfortunately we can't overload the bracket operator in JS. The `a[i]` syntax picks an element out of an array, but we can't overload it to do anything else. In the case of this query, the `nth` command doesn't actually pick anything out of the row, it just tells the RethinkDB server to do it later and the query is sent off.\r\n\r\nI'll try to write up a detailed explanation of how this works."
