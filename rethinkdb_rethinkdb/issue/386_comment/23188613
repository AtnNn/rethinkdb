      "This interface is sort of a pain right now, but it probably isn't going to get changed before RethinkDB is stable.  We aren't so much freezing the API as prioritizing stability and performance fixes for the next release.  There are a lot of rough edges like this on the query language that are inconvenient, but they aren't deal-breakers for most people, whereas RethinkDB not being production-ready is a deal-breaker for a lot of people.  So while we'll definitely address this at some point, it probably won't happen in 1.9.  (We might also address it via the `.group.map.reduce` proposal floating around rather than by patching `groupby`.)\r\n"
