      "@jdoliner - I think `zip` only works for the output of joins.\r\n\r\nWe've had a lot of internal discussions over what to do with `groupby`, and we seem to be leaning toward allowing more complicated expressions than just attribute names (for example, letting people group by the first letter of the `lastname` attribute).\r\n\r\nIf we decide not to do that, though, I like this proposed output format better than what we have now."
