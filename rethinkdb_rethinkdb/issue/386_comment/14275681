      "Hmm, I don't think javascript let's you overload the bracket operator. So you have to do:\r\n\r\n```Javascript\r\nr.db('books').table('koti')\r\n.groupBy('year', 'product', r.sum('amount'))\r\n.map({'year': r.row('group').nth(0),\r\n      'product': r.row('group').nth(1),\r\n      'amount': r.row('reduction')\r\n     })\r\n.run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nunfortunately we can't make this syntax much better because the language just doesn't give us access to the operator. But we should make it so that, that doesn't send a bad protocol buffer to the server."
