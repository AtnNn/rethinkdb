      "Hi @mlucy!\r\n\r\nThere are two things here.\r\n1. Changing  <code>[{\"group\":[2013,\"mobile\"],\"reduction\":7000}] </code> to something like <code>[{\"year\": 2013, product: \"mobile\",\"amount\":7000}]</code>\r\n2. Overloading bracket operator instead of using <code>nth</code> operator in javascript API\r\n\r\nProbably you might be saying about second point. But what i would like to know is first point. First point is worth revisiting before you freeze on API as it increases developer productivity. Especially when you have lot of fields, mapping all of them from group is going to be painful experience. \r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts before freezing on API."
