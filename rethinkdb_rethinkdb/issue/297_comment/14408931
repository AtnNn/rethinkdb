      "One machine is 64-bit, the other is 32-bit.  (See the x86_64 and i386 in the unames.)\r\n\r\nSo the real defect is that these machines with incompatible version numbers could connect to one another in the first place.  I thought we had added code that prevented this.  Maybe this is currently fixed."
