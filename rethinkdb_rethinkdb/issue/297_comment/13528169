      "This means we have caught a fake_archive_exc_t and the read side of the connection is still open.\r\n\r\nThis means that something was unsuccessfully deserialized.  The exception doesn't report whether the deserialization failed or whether EOF was surprisingly reached or what -- it could mean that an error happened while deserializing but somehow the read end is still considered open (because the EPOLLERR code before was really weird) or it means that some serialization/deserialization code is incorrect."
