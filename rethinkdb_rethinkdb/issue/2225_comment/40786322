      "@srh:\r\n\r\n> Why is it a 4-byte length instead of 8 bytes or a varint?\r\n\r\nI don't think we have any intention of allowing queries or responses greater than 4 GB in one message.  I can change this, if you think otherwise.\r\n\r\n> How can this possibly be a 64-bit integer, if it's encoded in a JSON string?\r\n\r\nGood point, it's treated on the server as a 64-bit integer, but I should have just said 'integer'\r\n\r\n> Wait, the requests send a token in JSON and the response receives it outside JSON?\r\n\r\nWe could send the token outside of JSON.  That might actually be better for certain error cases in the server.  We receive it outside of JSON so that the driver can know what query it is even if parsing fails.\r\n\r\n> Is the response actually sending the token twice?\r\n\r\nNo, I removed that because redundancy like that just adds more surface area for errors."
