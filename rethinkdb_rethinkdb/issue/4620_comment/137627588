      "@marshall007 the outgoing port shouldn't require any server changes. What I meant was just the TCP port that the operating system on the client picks randomly when it opens the connection to the server.\r\nIt's usually possible to get this from the socket object.\r\n\r\nIn node.js I think the `localPort()` method should return it: https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_localport"
