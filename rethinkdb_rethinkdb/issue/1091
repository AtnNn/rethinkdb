        "Right now `pluck` has a very nice shorthand for applying it to nested objects. A very similar syntax should be applied to `group_by`, `gmr`, `without` `has_fields` `with_fields` and perhaps others. I think for almost all of those I've mentioned the semantics are straightforward enough that I don't need to explicitly say them but if anyone would like clarification I'm happy to write them out.\n"
