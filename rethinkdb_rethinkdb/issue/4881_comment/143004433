      "The only thing that failure warning is telling you is that if the system (the virtual machine OR its host) crashes or is forcefully shut down, you might get corrupted (and possibly unrecoverable) data files. If you see this on real hardware in production, that's a warning to heed, but for `boot2docker`'s typical use cases it should be fine to ignore; you can likely just start over if you need to.\r\n\r\nFrom looking around, lack of `fsync` support on dirs is a common issue with `boot2docker`: see [this gist about a workaround using sshfs](https://gist.github.com/sevastos/2fa4c86f01541351efe8) and [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29818433/boot2docker-on-windows-running-mongo-with-shared-folder-this-file-system-is-n), among various others. They all mention MongoDB because it's more aggressive about this risk, but it should be easily to do the same for RethinkDB as well, if you want to."
