      "I believe we understand the issue, which is rooted in the fact that the node webkit window context has its own separate primitive constructors, so when it calls rethinkdb code (which is in the Node context) and the rethinkdb code uses `instanceof` to check types, which walks up the prototype chain, it find the wrong constructors for items that were created from constructors in the window context, then passed to the Node context."
