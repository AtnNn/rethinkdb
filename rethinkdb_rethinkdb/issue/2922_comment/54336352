      "@AtnNn: A .app is better for this for a number of reasons:\r\n- I have been told that we want an icon on the dialogs. This is possible, but then we have to hide the .icns file in the .dmg. By having a .app wrapper there is a natural place for it.\r\n- If we use osascript then we will have to be launched via the Terminal, which is sub-optimal, and at a minimum leaves an open (and to some confusing) Terminal window.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus: yep, typo. Corrected.\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky, @timmaxw: I have swapped in this latest text.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2014-09-03 at 10 39 12 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7431361/4138473/418d55cc-3391-11e4-842f-cee569ea1f1c.png)\r\n\r\nI also talked to @ahruygt about the icon for this. She will probably need some editorial and prioritization guidance."
