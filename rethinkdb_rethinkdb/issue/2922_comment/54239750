      "@mglukhovsky: I think the text should clearly indicate that there is a copy of RethinkDB installed, just not using the package. That's why I said \"Your copy of RethinkDB\".\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"in which case\" is wrong. Even if they installed it by some obscure method that is not either Homebrew or manually, the uninstaller still cannot remove the installation."
