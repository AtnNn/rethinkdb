      "The raw version of this is located at:`/System/Library/Extensions/IOStorageFamily.kext/Contents/Resources/Removable.icns`\r\n\r\nTo open this in Preview paste the following command into Terminal.app:\r\n\r\n`open /System/Library/Extensions/IOStorageFamily.kext/Contents/Resources/Removable.icns`\r\n\r\nIn order to make the `.icns` file needed you then need `Icons Composer.app`, which is part of the \"Graphics Tools for Xcode\" update for Xcode.app. I can help you @ahruygt when you are ready for that. \r\n\r\nFor the moment probably the best thing is to work at the largest size. Hopefully we don't have to make custom versions for the smaller sizes."
