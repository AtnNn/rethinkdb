      "If fixing this makes no sense right now (assuming that cJSON will be replaced eventually), I would like to suggest implementing a check on the server. If a string value contains invalid characters, it returns an error.\r\n\r\nThis is important because:\r\n1. Who knows what is actually happening right now. Could well be that it is leaking memory or something.\r\n2. Data from the user is discarded without any warning. Might be fine if this was MongoDB, but not for RethinkDB ;-)"
