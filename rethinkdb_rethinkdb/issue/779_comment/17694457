      "@atnnn You're talking about multi-byte character semantics? Fair enough.\r\n(If MBC is not supported, I don't see how substr or length should have different meanings. Also, if something expects a null-terminated string, that's simply because of a bad design choice in C that people still seem to adopt simply because it is so by tradition (and existing libraries and code works like that for the same bad reason), not because it is actually a good idea. But I'm getting off topic ;-) )"
