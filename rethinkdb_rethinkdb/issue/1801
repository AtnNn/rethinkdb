        "yes, i know, represent the uniqueness of a record in fewer bytes.\n\nbut there are cases when i have unique data that is very commonly short (averages <64 bytes) but can rarely spike up over 200 characters and i really don't feel like adding a hash (particularly one with as low a collision probability as i would need to duplicate the uniqueness i already have).\n\nmy issue is complicated by the fact that i need to maintain high throughput and low latency (adding a strong hash means cutting out something else i would like to do), and i'm trying to be conservative with space.\n\ni could really use something more like 255 characters rather than 127. other people may end up needing more, and it would be nice if it were arbitrary (or tunable). \n"
