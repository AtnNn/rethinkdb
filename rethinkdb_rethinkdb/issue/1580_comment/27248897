      "Because it's a bit of a pain to click through to the issue and cull out the relevant info here's a summary. The problem arises because we drop rows from `filter` if they are missing any attributes. This means that if someone does `r.any(doc[\"foo\"], doc[\"missing\"])` we drop the row. This is possibly not the most intuitive behavior."
