      "From the perspective of a new user, `all` and `any` don't affect ReQL's beauty because they won't encounter them (they aren't in the API docs).  The only people affected by this decision are old users who are using `all` and `any` in their code and want to translate that code to a new language for some reason.  From the perspective of *those* people, having the commands be as consistent as possible across languages is the most beautiful option, because it reduces the number of sharp edges they'll bump into while translating their code."
