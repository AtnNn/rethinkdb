      "Currently there is no consistent syntax across the JS, Ruby, and Python drivers for these operations, e.g.:\r\n\r\n* Python provides `r.all`, `r.and_`, `Term.and_`, as well as the operator &\r\n* Ruby provides `r.all`, `r.and`, `Term.all`, `Term.and`, as well as the operator &\r\n* JS provides `r.and`, `Term.and`\r\n\r\nAllowing for `r.any` and `Term.any` in all languages should be sufficient for all use cases while allowing for a consistent syntax across languages."
