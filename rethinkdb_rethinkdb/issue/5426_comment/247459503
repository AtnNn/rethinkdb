      "Until this is released, here's a work-around:\r\n\r\n* Download this .zip file: [web_assets_buffer_fix.zip](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/files/475609/web_assets_buffer_fix.zip)\r\n* Unpack it, it will create a `web_assets` folder\r\n* Start RethinkDB with the option `--web-static-directory <path to web_assets folder>`\r\n\r\nThis hopefully makes the web UI work with the latest versions of Edge and Firefox.\r\n\r\nNote that the RethinkDB server version will show up as 2.3.x in the web UI. You can still get the actual version of a server by looking at its page under \"servers\"."
