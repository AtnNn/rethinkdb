        "Our code has some built-in assumptions about the version of OpenSSL that we compile against (see #5699), but we our checks in [`configure`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/configure#L866-L872) are very limited, so don't catch these assumptions. At a minimum we should improve these assumptions, maybe adding a minimum version. One other point to make here is that we know the version available on MacOS does not meet our requirements, since Apple only has a depreciated version at this point."
