      "I looked into this, and thus far I think that `--registry http://no-npm-registry.rethinkdb.com` might be a good option. I think that this is all an attempt to make the non-download portion of our build process work when there is no internet connection. The more I read about this, the more it looks like the `npm` team has flubbed this particular use case, repeatedly in different ways.\r\n\r\nI did some preliminary testing on one machine, but need to do more testing with various versions of `node`/`npm`. As a side note, I tried bumping the version of `node` that we use internally to `v4.4.5` (the current LTS version), and everything works, at least on the surface."
