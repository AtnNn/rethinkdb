      "I have some testing in already for using `--registry http://no-npm-registry.rethinkdb.com`, but just have had other things bump in front of the testing I need to do to close this one off. The biggest annoyance is that I need to do offline testing for a bunch of versions of `npm`, so it is a bit of work."
