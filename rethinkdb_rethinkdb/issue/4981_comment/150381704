      "I opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4986 to track the `union` extension for selections.\r\n\r\n@jasonkuhrt No need to rename this issue. We usually try to avoid renames, because some of use use Gmail to keep track of issues and it can't keep track of email threads when the subject changes. Opened the new issue instead.\r\n\r\nI'll close this one, since the original question has been answered and we have a follow-up issue for a specific new functionality. We can still discuss the \"table operations on unions\" proposal here."
