      "This would have to mean an out-of-date `ql2_pb2.py` file, but we have a rule in the make file to explicitly re-build that file if it is out-of-date, both the copy in `drivers/python` and the one in `build/drivers/python`. And the `drivers/python` copy that is being referenced here is very explicit. The only way I can see this happening is if somehow the timestamps on the files wound up being set in a way that the source file (`src/rdb_protocol/ql2.proto`) got a newer timestamp that that file and so it was never rebuilt.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to close this unless people are still seeing it.
