      "I ran into this before, the issue is that the Python and JavaScript files are not in congruent directories when the `docs.py` file is generated out of the docs directory. Moving them allowed me to generate the `docs.py` file, but I don't know what other repercussions this may have. So we need to make this change. I am assigning to @neumino, as when I talked to him about this last he said he would do so."
