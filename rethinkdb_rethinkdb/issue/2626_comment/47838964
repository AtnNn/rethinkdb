      "The best way of defending against this particular problem is two-fold:\r\n1. While we are creating the documentation make sure this can't happen by adding the following line right before the second `result_file.write` line:\r\n```python\r\nassert parent not in (None, ''), 'Missing the parent entry for: %s in %s' % (name, file_name)\r\n```\r\nAs well as adding the following line to the end of the `tags` dict, plus the comma on the preceding line:\r\n```python\r\n'rethinkdb': [('', 'rethinkdb')]\r\n```\r\nI have checked that change into my `larkost/361-python-3-compatibility` branch with chekin b74a7a2\r\n\r\n2. The second issue is one of process: the output file should not have been checked into the repository until after some basic checks on the driver were done with it in place. We expect human-written files to be checked, so we should expect that of generated files as well.\r\n\r\nIt would not be a bad idea to also add a test to the repository that validates that all of the functions in the `rethinkdb` namespace have attached docs."
