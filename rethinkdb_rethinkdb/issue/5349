        "Hi @AtnNn , first off: **_beautifu_l** work on the windows **alpha2** build. I'm finally able to stop shipping the C# unit tests over to **CircleCI** to have them run.\n\nSo, I gave `alpha2` a try and I noticed some protocol discrepancies between **Linux** servers and **Windows** servers running **RethinkDB**.\n\nThe C# driver [has the full battery of auto generated YAML tests](https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver/tree/master/Source/RethinkDb.Driver.Tests/Generated) just like the **Java** driver.\n\nAll unit tests are **green** against a **Linux** server. When the YAML tests are thrown against `alpha2` some unit tests are failing. Here's a particular example:\n\n```\nTest:\n    datum/number.yaml, LineNum: 95\nExpected ReQL:\n    float(1234567890123456789012345678901234567890)\nExpected C#/Java:\n    float_(1234567890123456789012345678901234567890.0)\nRun ReQL:\n    r.expr(1234567890123456789012345678901234567890)\nRun C#/Java:\n    r.expr(1234567890123456789012345678901234567890.0)\nRunOpts: []\n\nProtocol In Context:\n    JSON Send: Token: 12, JSON: [1,1.2345678901234568E+39,{}]\n    JSON Recv: Token: 12, JSON: {\"t\":1,\"r\":[1.2345678901234567e39]}\n\nPROBLEM:\n\nExpected value to be between 1.23456789012346E+39 and 1.23456789012346E+39, but found 1.23456789012346E+39.\n```\n\nLooks more interesting when we pop up **Wireshark** protocol analyzer to see the actual wire-line transfer:\n#### RethinkDB LINUX (PASSING)\n\n![linux](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/478118/12772877/c3ad2230-c9ea-11e5-9c5d-1b43ba1ff21d.png)\n#### RethinkDB Windows (FAILING)\n\n![windows](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/478118/12772879/c744f6a2-c9ea-11e5-9a98-acfc776bb241.png)\n\nThis one is tricky. But... do you see it? :mag: **6 bytes** from the end of each the response: \n- **Linux**: `0x39`\n- **WIndows**: `0x37`\n\nThe full list of failing tests and their protocol outputs are here:\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/bchavez/rethinkdb-driver/build/365/tests\n\nAlso, if you want to run these tests while I'm away from the computer, you can send a PR with the new `serverDownload` URL in the build script [`build.fsx`](https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver/blob/master/Builder/build.fsx). Then your PR/newURL will get built and tested at https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bchavez/rethinkdb-driver/build/tests\n\nAgain, as always, awesome work with windows! :+1: \n\nThanks,\nBrian\n\nTest Setup\n**Windows**: Windows Server 2012 R2\n**Linux**: Ubuntu 14.04\n"
