      "Suppose the user has three replicas in a datacenter in Boston and one replica in each of three \"satellite\" datacenters in San Francisco, Hong Kong, and Paris. The primaries are all in the Boston datacenter, and the user wants writes to be acknowledged without doing a complete network round-trip to one of the remote datacenters. So they set the satellite replicas as non-voting."
