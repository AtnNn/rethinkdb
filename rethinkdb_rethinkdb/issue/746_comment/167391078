      ":+1: for TTL -- doing it manually is painful and prone to error because in general applications have any kind of batch-layer more as a last thought :smile: and you just have to forget your filter in one query and it get's weird. Maybe contrary to #4008 I would keep it real simple and just store the timestamp-of-death on the object itself. Makes for very simple filtering / scanning logic and the API can surface the complex stuff. \r\n\r\nE.g. [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#ttl) does it even hierarchical on column-family as well as cell-level (but they switched to msec notation in the newer cell-level so this seems to be the current way of thinking)."
