      "@danielmewes thanks for the update. Looking forward to it. I'll add my use case to the list:\r\n\r\neach row in the table would have its own expiring field set. I have a list of messages that need to expire based on what the user has defined the expiration in their profile settings -- could be \"delete all messages after 10 minutes\" or an option when creating a message \"delete this message after [5] minutes\". I read that some proposed solutions are setting the TTL on the table, that won't work for my usecase, i need tuple level control with the ability to set it when the data is entered into the table."
