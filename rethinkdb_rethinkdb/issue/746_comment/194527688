      "So what you and most of us would like is a background ttl task which deletes or marks for deletion and deletes multiple times a day, based on a secondary index whenever its value(s) match a user defined expression which evaluates to True. \n\nAnthony\n\n> On Mar 10, 2016, at 1:16 AM, Anthony Ettinger <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> @danielmewes thanks for the update.

I have a list of messages are going to expire based on what the user has defined the expiration in their profile settings -- could be \"delete all messages after 10 minutes\" or an option when creating a message \"delete this message after [5] minutes\". I read that some proposed solutions are setting the TTL on the table, that won't work for my usecase, i need tuple level control.\n> \n> \8212\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n> \n"
