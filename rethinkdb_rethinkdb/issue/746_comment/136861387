      "@webmasterkai -- you proposal is very cool, but a bit complicated by the fact a full table scan with a `filter` is a fairly inefficient way of doing this; for pure TTL we'd instead create an index on the expiration field instead.\r\n\r\nI also like the idea of triggering a feed event on expiration -- it has a certain elegance to it (though would probably not be as efficient as running a batch ttl delete on the server).\r\n\r\nSince this is a version or two away, we'll explore all these options during the ReQL discussion period when this gets scheduled. This is pretty exciting -- it's always fun to try and tease out an elegant, efficient solution when there are lots of options :grin: "
