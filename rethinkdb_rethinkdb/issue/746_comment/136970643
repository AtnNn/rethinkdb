      "I would agree with @webmasterkai on the additional uses and I would like to emphasise the changefeed reactions to expiries and times in general.\r\n\r\nSomething like `r.table('foo').changes(r.row('startsAt').eq(r.now()).run()` would really be useful in so many cases.\r\nOr even with time calculations `r.table('foo').changes(r.row('startsAt').eq(r.now().addMinutes(5)).run()` to find anything that is starting in 5 minutes. (`addMinutes` is just a dummy method as I was too lazy to see if a real one exists in rethinkdb).\r\n\r\n+1 for plugins btw~ :D"
