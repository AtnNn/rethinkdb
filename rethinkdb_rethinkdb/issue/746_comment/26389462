      "I would love this feature!  I am using rethinkdb to store session data for a live media server.  After a live video is finished being streamed, it is immediately persisted and the live media server keeps it around so that any viewer who may still be viewing the live version can make it to the end of the video.  Currently we have to implement a timer to handle TTL for these sessions, but we would love the elegance of native document TTL."
