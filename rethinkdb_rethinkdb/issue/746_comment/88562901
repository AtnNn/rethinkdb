      "The proposal above (from @elifarley) is great, but it fulfils one (but only one), the first, of three requirements I can think of:\r\n\r\n1. Conceptually expire stale data.\r\n2. Clear data in order to reduce disk space or improve performance.\r\n3. React to expiration of data.\r\n\r\n(I am thinking here of the features supported by Redis, and how I use them)\r\n"
