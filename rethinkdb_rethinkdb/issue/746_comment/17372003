      "Someone on Google Groups asked for it, so I created an issue. In general, I think the solution would be to create a secondary creation index and have the users run periodic deletes in a cron job. One way we could do this is, when we add trigger support, support a trigger that happens on a timer. I'm not sure if it's a good idea."
