      "Thanks @dscanlonpa!\r\n\r\nI think the right way to solve this is to build triggers first, and then have a timing trigger. This way a user could say \"trigger a function every minute that does an indexed read based on timestamp and purges old data\". We could then add a porcelain command on top of that to make this type of commands more accessible.\r\n\r\nI'm leaving this in backlog, as this won't happen before the LTS release."
