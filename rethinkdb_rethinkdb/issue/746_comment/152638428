      "Updating fields instead of delete is fine if it is an additional feature, but IMHO it cannot supplant the basic need or use case for automatic document expiration. The idea and power (again IMHO) of the latter lies in the fact that an important part of certain usage patterns can be entrusted to the server to be performed in an optimal way. For it to be truly useful, it should not require programmatic action outside of initial TTL configuration."
