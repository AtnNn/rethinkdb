      "M1 N2 should probably be using `--bind all` as well.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the problem here is that M2N1 connects to M1N1, and is told how to connect to M1N2 (`192.168.0.2:29016`), but connection attempts towards it fail.  M1N2 should be attempting to connect to M2N1 in the same manner, and it looks like that should work, so there may be something else going on here.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity (though I'm not sure it'll tell us anything we don't already know), could you paste the output of `r.db('rethinkdb').table('server_status')`, preferably with a client connected to M1N1?"
