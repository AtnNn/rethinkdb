      "Ok, I just tested this on three separate servers without docker, and the behavior is that the the last server to join will attempt to connect to all other existing nodes, but existing nodes do not initiate connections to new members of the cluster.  This behavior should be fine, as it's only a problem if the network configuration is not transitive, which is a problem in other situations and we shouldn't try to support it."
