        "The implementation of `datum_t::erase_range` checks that `start < r_array->size()` when it should check that `start <= r_array->size()`.\n\nFixing this bug will affect the behavior of secondary index functions, which means simply changing `datum_t::erase_range` is not the correct thing to do.  (And neither is simply changing `delete_at_term_t`.\n\n(This is one reason why this sort of functionality, which is specific to the delete_at_term_t, does not belong in some datum_t method.)\n\nI think the right way to migrate is:\n1. Make a new term with a new protocol buffer number -- and keep the old delete_at_term_t implementation around.\n2. Make the new version of drivers use the new number for .deleteAt.\n3. Find a way to warn users that their secondary index is using an obsolete ReQL function -- and offer a way to automatically rewrite a appropriate secondary index functions with the new, correct implementation (and rebuild its secondary index).\n\nThe work done for 3 will naturally carry over to other changes and fixes to ReQL that we need to do.  Maybe that should be tracked as a separate issue.\n\nIn the short run it's okay to have a bug in the ReQL implementation.\n"
