        "From #2957:\n\nThe `reconfigure` command should return a more detailed object, e.g.:\n\n```\n{\n    old_config: ...,\n    new_config: ...,\n    tables_reconfigured: X\n}\n```\n\nwhere X is zero if the user passed `dry_run=True`, 1 if the user called `t.reconfigure` and >= 0 if the user called `db.reconfigure`. This would result in a much more intuitive UI.\n\nOpen question, @coffeemug: what should we do about `old_config` and `new_config` if the user reconfigures an entire database?  Should it return an array of configs?\n"
