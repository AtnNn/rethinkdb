      "Hi Chet!\n\n> Rethink doesn't consistently provide the initial documents.\n\nSorry about this one.  Efficiently returning initial documents for large\nrange queries took a little longer to implement than we would have liked,\nbut this feature is mostly implemented and will be released in 2.2 (you can\ntrack progress at https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3579).\n\n> They don't support movement in ordered queries.\n\nThe feature was originally written with the assumption that you'd be\nstoring the rows in an ordered tree (ordered by the same field you're\nordering on in the query) so that you could quickly find the old row to\nremove it and quickly insert the new row.  Doing that would take care of\nposition changes automatically.  You aren't the first person to have asked\nfor this though.  You can track progress at\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3714 .\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Jun 30, 2015 at 12:28 PM, Chet Corcos <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hey guys, I'm working integrating RethinkDB with Meteor.\n>\n>    - driver <https://github.com/ccorcos/meteor-rethink>\n>    - example\n>    <https://github.com/ccorcos/meteor-any-db/tree/master/examples/rethink>\n>\n> I'm having some issue with change feeds though.
