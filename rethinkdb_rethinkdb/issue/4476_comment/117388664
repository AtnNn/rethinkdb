      "I see. So you're going to give the full arrays of before and after.... That doesn't make things terribly efficient though. In this case, I may as well just run the query all over again -- I'll have to diff them anyways.\r\n\r\nThat said, it would be awesome if I could just get some kind of event that says something (anything) changes within the query cursor (including the sort order). That way, I can rerun the query and do all the diff'ing through Meteor on the server.\r\n"
