      "@ccorcos we use milestones in the GitHub issue tracker as sort of an implicit roadmap. If you look at the 2.1 and 2.2 milestones, you can see what's scheduled for the respective releases. There are also \"2.x-polish\" milestones with issues that would be nice to get in, but for which we wouldn't hold the release. In addition issues in the `subsequent` milestone are those that we're considering for one of the upcoming releases, but that haven't been scheduled for a specific one yet."
