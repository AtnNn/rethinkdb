      "Not doozerd, it's effectively dead at this point. https://github.com/coreos/etcd provides much the same sort of consistent storage but is actively maintained.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind if you are going to use a cluster coordination engine for master election you may as well implement an abstract interface for master election so that plugins can be developed for Zookeeper, etcd and friends so that people can leverage stuff they already have.\r\n\r\nAlternatively if all you want is the same guarantees then it might make sense to implement Raft in RethinkDB for internal shard master elections."
