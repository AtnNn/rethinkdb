      "Your right it does add latency and time to get data to all of those instances, but what about having it distribute to only one \"primary\" in each datacenter? \r\n\r\nBasically on write (if configured) every write goes to at least one (least network latency) optimal instance per datacenter. Once the write is acknowledge by one member of each datacenter at that point you could have any secondary replication be an after the write process (maybe have each datacenter primary distribute the data appropriately).\r\n\r\nThat would basically take the 100 RAID1 disks down to 30. You would still sacrifice some write speed for data consistency and an ability for automated failover."
