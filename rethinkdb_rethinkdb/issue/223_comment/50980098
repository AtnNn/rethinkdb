      "You are actually surprisingly close to how larger systems that depend on consensus work.\r\n\r\nUsually there is some globally distributed consensus service (PAXOS et al) running in all DCs and then smaller cluster level consensus services in each DC.\r\n\r\nThe cluster consensus service can be used to evict machines, whereas the global service can be used to evict entire DCs.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind not using the big global consensus service for all decisions is that it's likely to be very slow and writes incredibly expensive. (think writing to ~100 disks in RAID1 for every operation)"
