      "@danielmewes \r\n\r\n> For completeness: 2.1 will have automatic failover and semi-lossless rebalance (the time where the table is unavailable during a rebalance will be a lot shorter), but it won't have automatic rebalancing.\r\n\r\nIs this still the case with 2.3? I thought with 2.2 onwards we could do a rebalance and still be able to write documents but we get an error that the primary shard is not available if we try to insert a document while the rebalance is in progress."
