      "@shimonmagal Currently changefeeds will always be terminated if a server shuts down or a table is resharded.\r\nWe do have some improvements to that in the pipeline. The first step is going to ship with RethinkDB 2.2 and allow changefeeds to survive brief disconnects between the client and the server (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3471 ). Later we also plan to add a type of changefeed that can survive server failures.\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to your Oracle -> RethinkDB replicator! :-)"
