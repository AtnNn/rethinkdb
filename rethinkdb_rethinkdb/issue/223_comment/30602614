      "+1 \r\n\r\nHonestly, this is the one missing feature that has me a bit uneasy with RethinkDB. Every other feature blows the competition completely out of the water. \r\n\r\n(We are going through an exact - \"should we bite the bullet\" phase right at this point since we are not quite as excited with the existing solution we have in place, although it does the failover bits quite well. Code is there, data migration scripts are there, testing has been completed, but the non-automagically swapover fear is quite big... Option are to (a) hobble along until the fear goes away and we can deploy, (b) look at other solutions (nothing with the same feature set) or (c) \"just do it\".)"
