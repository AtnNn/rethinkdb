      "Just throwing this out there but being able to recover from masters being unavailable is the one feature that seems to be missing at this point.\r\n\r\nI agree that you should think of this at a machine level but it would also be good to think of this at a Datacenter level as well. As generally if we are talking about a netsplit, the issue would affect connectivity between data centers.\r\n\r\nIdeally I would love to see if one could setup an odd number of datacenters i.e. 3, 5, 7 etc... If DC1 is the source of the network issue DC2 and DC3 could \"vote him off the island\" and takeover as a master. Subsequently DC1 would need to identify that he can no longer talk to DC2 and DC3 and go into \"read only\" mode removing the possibility of a split brain scenario. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this could be duplicated internally to a datacenter as well.\r\n\r\nNot sure how that works out in the code but just throwing it out there as a feature request."
