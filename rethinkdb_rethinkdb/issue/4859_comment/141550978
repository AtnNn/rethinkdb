      "The reason for doing this is that people expect `table.order_by(index: ...).changes` to behave like `table.order_by(index: ...).limit(INFINITY).changes`, but instead it behaves like `table.changes`.  This is extremely confusing -- why would ordering the table not accomplish anything?  So I think the current behavior is definitely bad.\r\n\r\nThere's an argument to be made that we should change the behavior or `table.order_by(index: ...).changes` if we found a way to make the behavior people expect efficient.  I still think we should produce an error until we can do that, though."
