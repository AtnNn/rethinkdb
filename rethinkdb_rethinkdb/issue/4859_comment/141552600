      "I talked with Daniel and he made the excellent point that even though we keep around an ordering in memory on the server for `.order_by.limit` changefeeds, we don't actually expose that ordering except by having things enter and leave the set, so we actually don't have to worry about this at all unless we implement something like #3714.  Closing since this isn't actually a problem right now."
