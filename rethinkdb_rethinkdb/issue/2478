        "In building the drivers we have been trying to build each driver in its own language. So we have the same logic in three different languages. It would be easier to pick one of them (Python), and do the work in that language. This does create a dependency on that language for building all of the drivers. But since we are already completely dependent on Python for testing, I don't feel that this is a large issue.\n\nI am opening this issue to make sure no one has an objection to us having Python (2.6/2.7) be required for building the drivers.\n"
