      "I have a backup of about 20 days ago. I do the backups manually and I've been outside the last 2 weeks. Now, the first app has been running properly with a new rethink_data directory for some hours. I will merge the backup with the new data and write a script to generate daily backups.\r\n\r\nIt it stored in a cheap VPS because it is a personal app, so I can't get a lot of info about the virtualization layer. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with the kernel version 2.6.32-042stab108.2 and rethinkdb 2.0.4~0trusty (GCC 4.8.2). It seems to be working over HHD.\r\n\r\nThe server was working from Aug  6 00:02 to Aug 24 14:22 (local time). That is the first time I tried to restart the server trying to startup rethink. So, it did not restart automatically. The first rethinkdb log line before this is about 15 hours before, a \"Someone asked for the nonwhitelisted file\".\r\n\r\nI use two tmux sessions to start rethink and the app on rc.local. When I saw the app was not responding, the rethinkdb session was closed. This usually happens when trying to start the session and it crashes. It seems the server was restarted but it does not appear on \"last reboot\" command.\r\n\r\nIt seems a hardware or virtualization problem while rethinkdb was writing some table files. I'll merge the new data with the backup, write the backup script and inform you if this happens again."
