      "Thank you @danielmewes. The day after the problem, the VPS was running very slowly and had some crashes, so I suppose it was a hardware failure. When the VPS was running well again, I imported the backup and got some problems with the indexes, but a rebuild solved the problem. Now I do a backup every day in case the problem happens again."
