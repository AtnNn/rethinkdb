      "Hi @Kamugo, the first thing I'd try if possible is adding a swap file (http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-add-a-swap-file-howto/). Depending on the virtualization stack used this might or might not work.\r\n\r\nAssuming the data is somewhat distributed across tables, another way you might be able to retrieve your data is by doing the following:\r\n1. Make a copy of your data directory (important!)\r\n2. For each table, there is a file named after a UUID in the data directory. Delete some of them *from the copy*\r\n3. Start rethinkdb on the copy by running `rethinkdb -d <copy dir> --cache-size 10` (note that this will recreate the deleted table files, but they'll now be empty)\r\n4. Export your data using e.g. `rethinkdb export`\r\n5. Repeat all steps, this time deleting another subset of the tables"
