      "Looks like it. :-(\r\nI'm also seeing the problem in 11a7aad6-8b1a-449a-a7ac-69a3d3ad1ef6. I haven't checked all of the other ones.\r\n\r\nDo you have backups? From the looks of it, those data files will be extremely hard to recover, so I recommend restoring the affected tables from the backup if possible.\r\n\r\nI've talked with @Tryneus about this and we're currently thinking through different paths due to which this could have happen.\r\n\r\nOne scenario is that the virtualization layer doesn't pass through disk syncs properly. A few questions about that:\r\n- What was the reason for restarting the server? Did you do a regular reboot or did it crash / was there a power outage etc?\r\n- Are you hosting the OpenVZ setup yourself? If yes, what are the exact versions you're using (OpenVZ version, host OS, kernel version on the host)? I'm not too familiar with OpenVZ, but are there any configuration files for it that you can share? We might want to replicate your setup locally to test some things, so this would be very helpful.\r\n- What file system(s) are you using? What are the mount options (output of `mount` on the host and/or guest)?"
