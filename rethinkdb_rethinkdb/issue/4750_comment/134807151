      "Thanks @Kamugo! Definitely let us know in case you see anything like this again.\r\n\r\nAn issue with the virtualization stack not passing through disk flushes correctly seems plausible (some virtualization solutions definitely have these issues). However if this happens again, we will definitely need look into this more because it's a pretty serious issue."
