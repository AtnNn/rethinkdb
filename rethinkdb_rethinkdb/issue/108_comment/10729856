      "I would urge not changing this part of the python driver again unless we get a lot of negative feedback from the wild. We discussed this ad nauseum before, and unless we overlooked something, this unfortunately looks to be as good a solution as we're going to get (unless Python people allow implementing `__getattr__` and friends on modules, in which case we can restore the `import rethinkdb as r` recommendation)."
