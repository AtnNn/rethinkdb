        "Every program I've written using changefeeds has had boilerplate akin to the following in it:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (change.new_val != null && change.old_val == null ) {\r\n  change.type = 'added'\r\n} else if ( change.new_val == null && change.old_val != null ) {\r\n  change.type = 'removed'\r\n} else if (change.new_val != null && change.old_val != null ) {\r\n  change.type = 'changed'\r\n// And the new guys:\r\n} else if (change.new_val != undefined && change.old_val == undefined) {\r\n  change.type = 'initial'\r\n} else if (change.new_val == undefined && change.old_val != undefined) {\r\n  change.type = 'uninitial'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty mind-numbing, and I would guess almost always necessary ( @segphault and @dalanmiller have written way more apps than me and could comment). In addition, it's also error prone. (There are two errors I made in the example above, can you spot them?) The drivers can provide convenience wrappers, but I think we should just make the changefeeds themselves more user friendly.\r\n\r\nI propose we add a `type` field to changefeed entries, and just put the type in as a string. This would also be a natural place to put `type: \"error\"` (see #5041).\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n1. slightly more cluttered\r\n2. slightly more bandwidth\r\n3. *sometimes* you can just delete old_val, add the new_val and you don't need to exactly classify the type. Even in this case, you can just ignore the type field.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n1. Obviously what everyone really wants\r\n2. Come on\r\n\r\n(I would also extend this behavior to the results from `return_changes` but I would guess the code is shared and so this would just happen as a side-effect)"
