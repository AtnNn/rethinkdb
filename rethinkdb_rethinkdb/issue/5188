        "Every program I've written using changefeeds has had boilerplate akin to the following in it:\n\n``` js\nif (change.new_val != null && change.old_val == null ) {\n  change.type = 'added'\n} else if ( change.new_val == null && change.old_val != null ) {\n  change.type = 'removed'\n} else if (change.new_val != null && change.old_val != null ) {\n  change.type = 'changed'\n// And the new guys:\n} else if (change.new_val != undefined && change.old_val == undefined) {\n  change.type = 'initial'\n} else if (change.new_val == undefined && change.old_val != undefined) {\n  change.type = 'uninitial'\n}\n```\n\nThis is pretty mind-numbing, and I would guess almost always necessary ( @segphault and @dalanmiller have written way more apps than me and could comment). In addition, it's also error prone. (There are two errors I made in the example above, can you spot them?) The drivers can provide convenience wrappers, but I think we should just make the changefeeds themselves more user friendly.\n\nI propose we add a `type` field to changefeed entries, and just put the type in as a string. This would also be a natural place to put `type: \"error\"` (see #5041).\n\nCons:\n1. slightly more cluttered\n2. slightly more bandwidth\n3. _sometimes_ you can just delete old_val, add the new_val and you don't need to exactly classify the type. Even in this case, you can just ignore the type field.\n\nPros:\n1. Obviously what everyone really wants\n2. Come on\n\n(I would also extend this behavior to the results from `return_changes` but I would guess the code is shared and so this would just happen as a side-effect)\n"
