      "Ah, I think I see the error (I think).  I'm not 100% sure the old code was correct, either.\r\n\r\nWe spawn a bunch of coroutines in `rdb_batched_repalce`.  Previously they only used objects that were constructed and deconstructed far above them (and possibly destructed on the other side of some sort of waiting that I didn't see).  They now use objects which are destructed immediately above them, so if `rdb_batched_replace` exits with some of them still incomplete then we're in big trouble.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner -- what's the best way to wait on a bunch of coroutines you've spawned?"
