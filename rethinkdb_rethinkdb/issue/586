        "Right now there isn't a way for a user to interrupt the post construction of a sindex (short of killing the server.) We probably need to add this since this can be a really long running operation. Probably the easiest way to do this would be to have deleting the sindex pulse an interruptor.\r\n\r\nAlso we should look at what happens with backfilling. When a replica first receives word of a sindex through a backfill it will launch a post construction. What happens if it then ceases to be a replica for the table or the sindex is deleted. All important questions to answer.\r\n\r\nGoes without saying but we need tests for this as well as answers."
