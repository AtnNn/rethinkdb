        "In testing for the v1.13.1 release I ran into a number of small problems in the tests. None of them proved to be actual problems, but rather changes needed in the tests. This is just to track those changes. The general problems:\n1. importing the installed driver rather than the one we are testing\n2. feeds.js will not create its own table rather then trusting that the 'test' table is its\n3. fixing the interface/stat test that was looking for a stat path that no longer exists \n4. moving a singal.SIG_IGN to a custom handler to prevent it from somehow preventing any handler from working\n5. allowing for the change of 'No Master avalible' to 'Master for shard'\n6. minor problems in the code that cause blocking warnings in newer versions of Clang.\n"
