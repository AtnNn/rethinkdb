      "@danielmewes yeah, I'm thinking this could be done using the same index machinery, only maybe with a flag that indicates it was constructed as a trigram and can be used for certain queries.\r\n\r\nAlso thanks for finding #4226 @marshall007 I had forgotten about that one. Technically I guess ngrams would be more general than a trigram index, but that issue seems narrowly focused on prefixes only"
