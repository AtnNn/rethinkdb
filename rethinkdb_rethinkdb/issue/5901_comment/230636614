      "Thanks for the issue report.\r\n\r\nThis might just be an issue with the \"nested queries\" check being too strict in this case. Internally, any query using r.row is converted into the thing that `print` prints here, i.e. a lambda that uses `r.row` in its body and ignores the input variable.\r\n\r\nHowever it looks like this syntax is not accepted back as an input."
