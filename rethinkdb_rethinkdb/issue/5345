        "To make the Java driver really useful for realtime applications, we need to add a way for handling changefeeds asynchronously.\r\n\r\nA good first step is going to be making the Java connections thread-save, which @pires has started working on in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/5292 .\r\n\r\nHowever we should also integrate with some of the available frameworks for this type of thing that exist apart from raw threads. Here are a few that we should consider:\r\n\r\n* RxJava https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava (interesting read: http://blog.couchbase.com/why-couchbase-chose-rxjava-new-java-sdk )\r\n* Reactive Streams https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm\r\n* Netty http://netty.io/ https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4802\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand, RxJava and Reactive Streams are higher-level APIs, while netty is a bit more low-level.\r\n\r\nWe should discuss which one we want to focus on first. Ideally we'll provide support for all of these APIs / frameworks eventually, similar to the Python driver, but let's start with one."
