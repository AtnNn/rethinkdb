        "Hello,\r\n\r\nThe [documentation](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/memory-usage/) states: `Every table has an overhead of 8 MB per server.`\r\n\r\nWould you consider an eviction strategy for this hidden overhead? I'm willing to accept a performance hit if table needs to be accessed that hasn't been touched in a while.\r\n\r\nI have a use case where new tables are created on the fly (versioning of sorts) and old tables get abandoned but not deleted. Currently I only have about 2GB of data spread across 550 tables. Which makes the baseline memory requirement > 4.5GB. On a t2.medium EC2 with 4GB of RAM this chokes the server to a halt about once a day."
