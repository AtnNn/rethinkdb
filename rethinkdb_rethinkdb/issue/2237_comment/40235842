      "@internalfx -- thank you! There are lots and lots of very exciting developments coming up (but have no fear, we're still, and always will be, completely focused on developer happiness and API and implementation quality).\r\n\r\nRegarding the data or the core dump -- we are happy to sign an NDA agreement with you if it makes a difference, and we can include a clause that we'll wipe all data from our servers after we investigate this bug. If that works for you -- shoot me an e-mail at slava@rethinkdb.com.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we'll still work very hard to fix this bug, but it may not be feasible until we get more information (either from you, from other users, or in our own attempts to reproduce it)."
