      "I restarted the servers themselves after the upgrade.....\r\n\r\nAlso I don't think I could give the data, but I certainly understand why its helpful. There are 2 reasons I can't give you the data.\r\n\r\n1. The data is kinda sensitive, and we tell people we don't share their information with 3rd parties.\r\n2. I'm doing lots of testing, loading and unloading of records. So the specific data that crashed doesn't exist anymore.\r\n\r\nOff topic...\r\nI wish I could pat you guys on the back, REALLY LIKE working with this. I've begun writing an adapter for the sailsjs framework. There are a few others, but they look like dead projects. Will give you a shout out when released. The more plugins, tools and frameworks that integrate and use this, the better. Really want this project to succeed, I\8217ll be spreading the word where I can."
