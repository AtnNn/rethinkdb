      "@internalfx Is there a chance you could provide the rethinkdb data directories to us (ideally from all of the nodes)? That would make it easier to track down the issue. The data would be used internally by us solely for reproducing and tracking down this issue. @mglukhovsky can provide you with information on how to upload the data I think."
