      "Your teams responsiveness only increases my confidence in the product. I've been using this database for about 10 days now, and am already having a hard time considering using anything else.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw your product, I thought the web admin was it's \"must-have feature\". But its actually ReQL! Other query languages feel like junk now.\r\n\r\nI think your project deserves to grow, and I will be spreading the word."
