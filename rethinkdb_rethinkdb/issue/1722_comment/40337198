      "Reopening. The current behavior confuses everyone.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo rethinkdb create --runuser rethinkdb --rungroup rethinkdb data_dir\r\n```\r\n\r\nEmpirically, everyone expects this command to run as root, create the data directory, and set its ownership to user and group `rethinkdb`. They typed `sudo`, so they feel like we're switching to `rethinkdb` far too early (we should `mkdir` and set permissions first). I think in case of `create` this behavior is sensible.\r\n\r\nMoving to 1.12.x since it's related to #2250 that users are running into."
