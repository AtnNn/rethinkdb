      "I suppose the question is whether `sudo` should apply to the user we tell RethinkDB to switch to. If you switch to the user `rethinkdb` via `su rethinkdb` and then run `sudo rethinkdb create` in the relevant directory, what happens? (May be `sudo` is configured in such a way on your system that it doesn't apply to the user `rethinkdb`)."
