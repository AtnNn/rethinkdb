      "Hi @sym3tri,\r\n\r\nSorry you ran into this issue, and thanks for the bug report.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB internally uses vector clocks to track configuration information. If you try to do two different configuration actions simultaneously, the vector clocks can get into a conflicted state, and you'll see this message. You can use the web UI to \"resolve\" the conflicts, which should put your cluster back into a working state.\r\n\r\nHowever, this shouldn't cause RethinkDB to crash. Can you give us more details about the crash? Did RethinkDB produce a backtrace or a core dump? I'm noticing a 4-hour gap in the timestamps between the last error message and the `systemd` message; was RethinkDB working normally during that time?"
