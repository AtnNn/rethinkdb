        "Currently we use `PyYAML` to read the Polyglot tests, and it is a good format for simple tests. However we have quite a number of places where we actively working around it because it is trying too hard to help us (e.g.: finding dicts in the middle of our queries and blowing up when they don't make sense as that). The basic format of YAML is pretty good, but I don't think we need all of it.\r\n\r\nSo my proposal is to create our own YAML-like parser, one that is capable of parsing our current tests and allowing people to stop working around YAML. The basic requirements:\r\n1. Allow all of the current nesting and the `key->value` nature that we use\r\n2. Don't translate anything of the `value`s. We can do `dict` translation much better in our testing code.\r\n3. Keep the original line numbers so we can point out the raw text for debugging (#4490)\r\n"
