      "I can think of several cases where this is useful:\r\n* Languages that don't let us overload prefix `-`.\r\n* Lisp derivatives -- people using a Clojure of Common Lisp driver will probably expect `(- x)` to work, and we don't want to force driver developers to manually translate queries to compensate for our unusually strict arity requirements.\r\n* Cases where you're splicing in a list of arguments, either on the client or after we add `r.args` -- there's a solid argument to be made that `r.add(*arr)` should be exactly equivalent to `r(arr).reduce{|a,b| a+b}`.  (Actually, Common Lisp goes so far as to define `(+) => 0`, but I don't think we want to do that.)"
