      "This is a terrible idea. Having 1-ary subtraction makes sense when you write it (- 1) because `-` has two meanings and `(- 1)` looks very similar to `-1`. However if someone writes `r.sub(1)` then they probably meant to add in a second argument and forgot it. Especially once we add a unary negation operator no one in their right minds will ever write `r.sub(1)` to mean `-1` when they can just write `-1`. 99% of the time this behavior is actually invoked it's going to be making typos lead to subtly wrong results rather than returning error messages."
