      "> @jdoliner Don't apologize, your post was fine, if @mlucy is being an idiot Lisptard he needs to be told so.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue because the level of discourse here doesn't meet the standard laid out in http://www.defmacro.org/2013/04/03/issue-etiquette.html. Feel free to open a new issue and start another discussion that follows this standard.\r\n\r\nWe've discussed this often enough that I no longer feel it necessary to be subtle about it or to discuss it in private. @srh -- your comment is an embarrassment to the company and to our community. Please don't put me in position where I have to write a comment like this again."
