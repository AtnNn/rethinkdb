      "As a lisper, I expect variadic `-` to work as in lisp.\r\nAs a haskeller, I like `negate` better.\r\nAs a mathematician, I prefer `r.inverse(1, r.add)`\r\nAs a pragmatic, I prefer just using `r.sub(0,x)` to get `-x` because it works, it is short and it is not controversial.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of negate is that `r(1).negate()` is a lot more clear than `r(1).sub()`"
