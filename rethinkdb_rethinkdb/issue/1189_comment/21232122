      "> [Words words words]\r\n\r\nVery well I'll play Linus here. Trying to be so politically correct that we're afraid of a little sarcasm just leads to people being nasty in underhanded ways. You for example try very hard to have good issue etiquette, but you also switch to a troll account called punctuationnazi when you'd rather hang out on the lower levels of the disagreement pyramid (http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html) than actually argue your point. That's actually nasty, that's a premeditated, repeated attempt to aggravate another member of the community. The first sentence of EG8 is: \r\n\r\n> Many open source projects consider it ok to be abrasive on the tracker. I think it\8217s never ok.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should reword that to:\r\n\r\n> Many open source projects consider it ok to be abrasive on the tracker. I think it\8217s never ok. Unless you call it a \"prank\" and do it anonymously."
