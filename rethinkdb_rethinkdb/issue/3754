(This has already been done in Ruby.)\r\n\r\nA few good things to test:\r\n* Test that you can run queries while waiting on the result of a changefeed (e.g. during prefetching).\r\n* Test that you can run queries while a big noreply write is happening.\r\n* Check that you can close a cursor while a request for a batch is outstanding."
