      "Thanks @t3hmrman !\r\nWould you mind signing our CLA http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/ ? We require this before we can merge a pull request.\r\n\r\nAbout the change itself: The option should be referred to as `array_limit` not `arrayLimit`. The camel case name is specific to the JavaScript driver (and maybe a few third part ones), while all of our drivers accept the underscore form `array_limit`. Other than that it looks good to me."
