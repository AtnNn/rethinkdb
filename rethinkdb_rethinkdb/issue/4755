        "If you pass 1 argument to time, you get the error message `Expected between 4 and 7 arguments but found 1`. If you pass 5 arguments then you get the error message `Got 5 arguments to TIME (expected 4 or 7).`\r\n\r\nI propose two improvements to the error message:\r\n1. Make the first error `Expected 4 or 7 arguments but found 1`. Saying \"between 4 and 7\" is misleading as only 4 or 7 are valid.\r\n2. Include the query term and arguments in the error message, e.g. `TIME expected 4 or 7 arguments but found 1: <print arg>`."
