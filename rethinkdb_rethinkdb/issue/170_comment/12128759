      "I suspect this is another example of our classic problem of not having a a bulletproof way for machine `a` to tell machine `b` how to contact machine `c`. This would explain why it behaves differently on different network setups. We should obviously figure out what's breaking in this case and fix it but we should also make an issue (rdb issue) which detects nontransitive connectivity. Realistically I think it's going to be a while before we have this working in all cases (honestly networks are so diverse we may never). So at least this will make it easy to diagnose the problem. We could even have a way for the user to give the system of hint of how to connect to a machine via the webUI in the resolution dialogue for the issue."
