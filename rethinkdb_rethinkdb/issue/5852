        "Currently we use tcp for intra cluster connections. Why don't we use sctp for cluster connections?\r\n\r\nSctp should be ideal for intra cluster connections, since there could be streams for each commit which can be transmitted as individual message without blocking other commits if there is a packetloss.This could increase the overall throughput and latency on slow or lossy connections.\r\n\r\nElse sctp is capable to mark messages with high prio, which means we use intra-connection QoS, which might reduce the ping for heartbeats and important messages as well.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to implement sctp, tcp should be still supported - might it be as failback or as explicit option in the configfile. :)"
