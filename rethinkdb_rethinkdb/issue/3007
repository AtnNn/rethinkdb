Specifically the following are still to be done:\r\n- [x] Edit the message texts in the Uninstall.app script\r\n- [ ] Adding an icon to Uninstall.app (need to add the .icns file to the `Contents/Resources` folder plus edit the `Info.plist` file)\r\n- [x] Create CSS settings for `Release Notes.html`, and wrap the existing content with header/footer with those lines\r\n- [x] Tweak the icon size/positions and the background image in the .dmg"
