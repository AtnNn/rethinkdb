      "What @coffeemug said doesn't actually make any sense but I'm guessing he's thinking about dropping rows from merge that are missing an attribute. We really shouldn't do that. It's pretty nice to have the invariant that `merge` doesn't change the size of a stream. This is the same reason we don't drop rows from `pluck` I believe."
