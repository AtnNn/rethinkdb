      "I would definitely like to discuss it further; my initial reaction is skepticism.  If you try to reference a non-existent field in e.g. an `update` you get an error.  This is important because if we just silently skip merging elements like this, people might think that they're performing a write when in fact nothing gets written to disk.  I might be able to be convinced otherwise, though.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'm worried about your semantics for queries like:\r\n```ruby\r\ntable.update{|row| {c: row['a']+1} # error\r\ntable.update{|row| {subrows: row['subrows'].merge{|subrow| {c: subrow['a']+1}}}} # not an error\r\n```\r\n"
