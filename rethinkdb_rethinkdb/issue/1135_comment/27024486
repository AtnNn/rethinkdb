      "As soon as it's seems useful enough to justify doing it we'll have an indexed version of `gmr` as well. Also while it we could theoretically add this optimization we don't actually have it and even if we did implementing it as `gmr` takes you from sending every row in the table over the network to only sending data proportional in size to the output over the network. Which I think in most cases is a much more meaningful savings."
