      "Whenever we do fix this we should just make `distinct` a rewrite like so:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nstream.distinct()\r\n# rewrites to\r\nstream.grouped_map_reduce(lambda x: x, lambda x: x, lambda x,y: x)[\"reduction\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso anyone having trouble with distinct using too much memory or being too slow should try just rewriting it manually. It may well fix your problems."
