      "I like this structure -- it's great. The only thing I'd consider changing is instead of `{ num_replicas: count, num_directors: count }` I'd have `{ replicas: ['t1', 't2'], masters: ['t1', 't2' ]}` (or possibly even make it more detailed). I realize this is information duplication, but I think it's worth trading that off for convenience.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure how much we want to do -- we should sit down and hash this out. @neumino -- do you think duplicating information like that is useful and how much would you put here?"
