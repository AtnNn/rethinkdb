I would like to display that instead of the first element in `ips` if possible.\r\n\r\nHaving the number of shards for which the server is directory/replica is nice (for the server__s__ view).\r\n\r\nFor a simple server view where we display all the shards stored on this server, I can make an extra inner query to get what I want,"
