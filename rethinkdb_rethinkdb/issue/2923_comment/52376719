      "The web UI currently displays uptime and IP address, although I think it's fetching uptime through the stats interface. So the `ips` and `running_since` fields are probably pretty important too.\r\n\r\nWe could display some stats, such as CPU, memory, and disk utilization, in this interface if we wanted to; or we could put all the stats in the main stats interface (#2885).\r\n\r\nWe could also expose a `cache_size` field. If `cache_size` can be changed at runtime, it should go in `rethinkdb.server_config` instead."
