        "The `rethinkdb` npm module seems not to be able to run twice. Which can be the case if you use two modules that `require('rethinkdb')`, if they use two different versions or if they don't share a common parent in the dependency tree that requires it too (in such a case `npm` would only put the `rethinkdb` module once, in this parent's *node_modules* directory).\r\n\r\nIf you do that you'll end up with:\r\n**`Error: Namespace \"rethinkdb.base\" already declared.`**\r\n\r\nHope it helps. And if I didn't get something, sorry in advance.\r\n"
