      "Merged into next (see commit 5e407603e2dfcc70, internal code review 292). Integration is enabled travisci -- see https://travis-ci.org/rethinkdb/rethinkdb.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, every push to every branch will trigger a build and unittest on travisci. __In order for everything to work properly, merge next into your branch__ (or cherry-pick the .travis.yml file in the root directory from next into your branch). Otherwise, travis will think your branch is a ruby project (it's their default) and the build will fail. Everyone will also get email notifications on status change (e.g. you'll get an email if you broke the build, or if you fixed the build -- if you break the build twice in a row, you'll only get one email).\r\n\r\nAs a matter of policy, we shouldn't merge a branch into next unless it passes a travis build.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue -- we'll reopen new ones for specific details as necessary.\r\n\r\n"
