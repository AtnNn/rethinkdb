      "Talked to @atnnn, we decided to go with travis-ci. Here's what we're going to do:\r\n\r\n1. ~~I'm going to change travis config to use debug mode -- all unit tests pass there.~~\r\n2. I'll then merge the `.travis.yml` file into next, tell everyone about it, and we'll start using it. -- currently in review 292\r\n3. @atnnn will change `make unit` to `make test` and allow it to take env args (to turn on and off various types of tests). We'll then enable ReQL unit tests on travis.\r\n4. We should hack travis a little bit to send everyone notifications on next failures. I'll talk to @atnnn about it.\r\n5. I'll also contact Travis folks about the pro version.\r\n6. Once #379 is done, we'll either change it to use the release mode, or have a matrix of two builds.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we'll proceed with the plan for long integration tests as before."
