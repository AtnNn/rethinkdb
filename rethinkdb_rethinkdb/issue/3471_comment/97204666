      "So the problem I see now with having cursors not automatically reconnect is code like this:\r\n```\r\ncur = ...changes().run(resumable=true);\r\nforeach x in cur:\r\n   print(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow and where would you handle the disconnect in there? You couldn't handle it inside the loop, since the error will be generated/thrown during the iteration. So resuming would require something like this:\r\n```\r\ncur = ...changes().run(resumable=true);\r\ntry:\r\n  label loopMore\r\n  foreach x in cur:\r\n     print(x)\r\ncatch RqlConnectionError:\r\n  cur.resume()\r\n  goto loopMore\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that's not a pattern we want to encourage. It also requires that the cursor can be iterated multiple times, and iteration resumes where it left off."
