      "We should call resumable cursors Fibonacci Cursors (TM) :)\r\n\r\n`resume_limit_seconds` and `resume_retry_second` sound good.\r\n\r\n@timmaxw\r\n> Instead of feed_buffer_size I propose resume_size_limit. The parameter is not feed-specific, since it works for arbitrary cursors. But it is resume-specific.\r\n\r\nIs that true? That parameter doesn't seem to make much sense for non-feed cursors (unless maybe the batches are *really* big).\r\nWe could also make it control the size of the feed queue in the absence of reconnects, instead of relying on the global array size limit for it."
