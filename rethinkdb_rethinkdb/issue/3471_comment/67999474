      "Another thing to note is that our backfill implementation relies on taking a snapshot of the whole table while it's running. We have to think about how that interacts with changefeeds that might be open for a long time because the client is slow in reading all the (initial) data of the cursor. Specifically I'm concerned about memory consumption on tables with high write loads.\r\nIt might be necessary to enhance the buffer cache to allow paging out snapshotted blocks to disk. This will be useful for backfills as well, and will later become useful for https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3464.\r\n\r\nCan I change my \"My guess is that this is probably not too difficult in a basic form.\" to a \"This is a significant amount of work, but seems feasible.\"?"
