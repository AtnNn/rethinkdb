      "We might also want to beef up `resume` with optargs for number of reconnects before failure, and time between reconnects. That would make it dramatically easier to use, and would make the users feel safer.\r\n\r\n> Why not `feed.next(auto_reconnect = True)`?\r\n\r\nThere are multiple ways to access a cursor, though (`each` in js, for example, and Python's iteration machinery). Having an explicit `resume` command would allow all of these methods of iterating over a cursor to work with resumable cursors.\r\n\r\n> Also I think we'll have to implement the replication timestamp based interface with tokens and erase_range items later to allow replication into other systems across server failures and configuration changes.\r\n\r\n:+1: "
