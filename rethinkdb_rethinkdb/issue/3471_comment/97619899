      ":+1: to `resume_limit_seconds`, `resume_limit_rows`, and `resume_retry_seconds`.\r\n\r\n> Presumably, up to the ttl for the buffer itself, since it doesn't make sense to reconnect after that\r\n\r\nYes. For example, if `resume_limit_seconds` is 60.00s and `resume_retry_seconds` is 6.00s, then we retry at the following times: 6.00s, 15.00s, 28.50s, 48.75s. We should make require that `resume_retry_seconds < resume_limit_seconds`."
