      "I am a little lost about the details, so can someone correct me on what features we are aiming for?\r\n\r\n1. Will all changefeeds be resumable, or do you need to opt-in when creating the changefeed?\r\n2. Does the reusability survive a client crash?\r\n3. Can you resume after the hosting server crashes?\r\n4. Do you have to know what server is hosting the feed, or can you connect to any server?\r\n5. Can multiple clients pull from the same changefeed to make a work queue? (probably not, but we should be clear)\r\n6. Will these be named, or are we going with the timestamp/token idea?"
