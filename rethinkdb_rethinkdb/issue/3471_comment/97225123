      "Another way to think about it is, what do we gain with resume? What scenarios will you want to be able to resume a cursor, but not more than one hour later, and you don't want to rely on the underlying TCP mechanisms for timeout and reconnection attempts etc. You would need to know why you disconnected, and have a better strategy for deciding when to re-attempt in order for explicit reconnection to be a useful ability. With the very light guarantees we're adding here (you still need the cursor in memory), I don't think it's likely many people will fall into this category"
