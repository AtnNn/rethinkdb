      "Well I'm not sure if the aim should be to replace kafka...db operations are\nmore expensive than log appending...so if you need extreme throughput then\nkafka is pretty epic. And they have some other great features as well.\nHowever where rethinkdb falls short now IMHO is that if you persist the\nchange feed to kafka with a service (we have a docker microservice running)\nthen there's no way to guarantee that every change is persisted (in case\nyou restart the service or error). Being able to resume a log tail would\nremedy that\nOn Fri, 29 Jul 2016 at 14:44, fkerbouci <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> If RethinkDB integrates reliable changefeed consumption with resume\n> feature, and group consumption with load-balance feature, we would\n> immediately replace Kafka for it.\n>\n> But it does only half of the job.
