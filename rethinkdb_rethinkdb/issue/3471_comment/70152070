      "That seems reasonable to me.  If we always kept at least one old batch around until we evict the feed entirely, then it would be impossible for someone to process a row with a given token, crash, and not be able to restart at that token (i.e. they'd have to not be logging every token they process to whatever service they use to recover).  That seems like an OK guarantee for a first pass, and we can make the guarantee stronger later."
