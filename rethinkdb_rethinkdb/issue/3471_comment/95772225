      "Got it, thanks!\r\n\r\nWith queues on the shards, could we get away with one intracluster message per named feed per client *catchup*, but keep post-catchup messages deduplicated? (In other words, if we need to send old changes that the client missed we'd do it via a separate intracluster message, but keep all further realtime messages deduplicated?) If we can do that, I think this would be perfectly acceptable. If not, could you explain why that's hard?"
