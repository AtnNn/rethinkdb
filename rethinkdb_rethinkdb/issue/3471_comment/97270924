      "mlucy's proposal works equally well with squashing and non-squashing changefeeds, so I'd change that \"possible\" to a \"yes\".\r\n\r\nI don't think I understand what you mean by `at least once`. Neither of my proposals will lose changes, in the sense that if you resume a changefeed and apply all the changes in it then you'll reach the current state of the table. But both of them can squash changes, in the sense that you might not see every intermediate state that the database passed through before the changefeed was resumed."
