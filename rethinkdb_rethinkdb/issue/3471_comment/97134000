      "Disconnected in the \"hasn't consumed an item\" sense (or something similar), not in the TCP sense. this whole issue is expecting a TCP disconnect. That does raise a good point though, we should probably define exactly what a disconnect is. I assume the one hour timer starts when the connection is lost.\r\n\r\nAlso, we don't have to monkey patch, just return a subclass like ResumableCursor"
