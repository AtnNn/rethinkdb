      "I personally would always set `return_initial` to `False` by default, simply because having it `True` comes with significant costs in some of the cases. If a user needs the initial value they will know that they do so, no matter whether it's a single document or a range.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug you're probably thinking of specific use cases when you say that `return_initial` would be more conveniently default to `True` for single-document changefeeds and `False` otherwise. Could you elaborate a bit on those?"
