      "> You would need to know why you disconnected, and have a better strategy for deciding when to re-attempt in order for explicit reconnection to be a useful ability. With the very light guarantees we're adding here (you still need the cursor in memory), I don't think it's likely many people will fall into this category\r\n\r\nI realize now my last sentence of this comment was poorly worded. I didn't mean no one falls into the category needing these guarantees, I meant very few people will both only need these guarantees, and also need very tight control over when to resume.\r\n\r\nI think it's likely most users will just \"want it to keep going if it can\" and auto-resumption makes sense for that."
