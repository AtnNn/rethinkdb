      ":+1: for @mlucy's proposal: `include_initial_vals` and cursor recovery across connection loss for 2.1, then cursor recovery across client loss if people want it, then btree timestamping for 2.2. I think we'd have to discuss the cursor serialization interface more if/when we actually implement it."
