      "I agree with @timmaxw that we shouldn't worry about non-squashing resumable changefeeds.\r\nI still think non-squashing non-resumable changefeeds are useful.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see resumable and non-resumable changefeeds really have quite different types of use cases.\r\nThe primary use case for resumable changefeeds is for data synchronization into other systems (e.g. ElasticSearch).\r\nNon-resumable changefeeds are sufficient for things where you want a web app or something update in realtime once some user posts a new comment or your scoreboard changes etc. These are also the types of scenarios for non-squashing changefeeds can be useful."
