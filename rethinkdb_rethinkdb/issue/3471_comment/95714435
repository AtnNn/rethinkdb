      "@kofalt \r\n> I am assuming that since would require keeping a buffer of changes both sent & unsent, and thus has a finite lifespan. What is the failure mode, closing the feed & error on a since open attempt?\r\n\r\nYes, that would throw an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Finally, any thoughts on changefeed name overlap? I am envisioning a case where a changefeed JoeChanges is created, and is closed (intentionally or an error state like overflow). At which point it may be possible to confuse a newly-created feed JoeChanges with the originally-named JoeChanges. Should clients be expected to manage this distinction, perhaps by appending a guid to the feed name? \r\n\r\nI think we would rely on the application to take care of that (e.g. by appending a uid to the name as you say)."
