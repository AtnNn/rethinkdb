      "fwiw, I agree with @mlucy that if they want finer control, requiring the\nuser to go manual is better than adding more optargs. I see auto as being\n\"you do what you think is best\" setting. I also don't think you gain much\nmeaningful control by tuning that parameter.\n\nOn Thu, Apr 30, 2015 at 3:09 PM Daniel Mewes <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> I'd prefer having the word buffer in there. feed_size_limit suggests that\n> the feed itself has some size limit, which isn't really the case.
