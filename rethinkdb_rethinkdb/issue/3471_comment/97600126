      "That proposal sounds really good.\r\n\r\nHaving the option `resumable: 'auto'` sounds like a great idea. This gives us the benefit of increased visibility of the feature, since we'd still have the `resume` method. It further allows users to implement their own back-off / resume logic if they really need to.\r\nI'd suggest that `resume` in that case only performs a single attempt at reconnecting and resuming, and throws an error if the reconnect fails.\r\nIn the `auto` resumable mode on the other hand I think we should support additional optargs `resume_retries` and `resume_interval` or something like that and have the cursor retry repeatedly within the bounds of those parameters."
