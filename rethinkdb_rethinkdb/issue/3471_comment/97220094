      "I like auto-resumption for the reason daniel suggested, it makes it really awkward to do the error handling otherwise. It doesn't seem too magical to me because we aren't naming the changefeeds (yet), so it's much easier to make this a seamless abstraction.\r\n\r\nIn fact, with the current proposal, I don't know if there's any good reason to *not* make cursors auto-resumable by default. This seems like a pure upgrade to cursors that the user doesn't need to know about any more than they need to know that cursors send CONTINUE on their behalf every so often.\r\n"
