      "I like the mlucy api better, but I like coffeemug's guarantees better. If my process crashes that was listening on the changefeed with the @coffeemug proposal, I can always recover what happened in between. If we only store the last sent batch in memory, we solve the \"can't recover a feed\" problem, but we don't solve the \"I'm sure I didn't miss a change due to a crash\" problem."
