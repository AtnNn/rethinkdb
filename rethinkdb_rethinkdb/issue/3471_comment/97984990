      "I'd prefer having the word `buffer` in there. `feed_size_limit` suggests that the feed itself has some size limit, which isn't really the case. I'd be fine with `feed_buffer_limit` though without a unit.\r\n\r\nHaving it control the general buffer size for changefeeds even in the absence of disconnects sounds great. I thought that used to be controllable through the array size limit before, but it seems I was wrong.\r\n\r\nI have a slight preference for having the `resume_initial_retry_interval` optarg to make the underlying algorithm more visible and to give users a better sense of control."
