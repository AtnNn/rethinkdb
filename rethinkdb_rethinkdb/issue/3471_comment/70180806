      "> For point changefeeds it's cheap to send users the initial value every time, so there's no need to make changefeeds resumable or persistent.\r\n\r\nThis is true for some but not all use cases.  We support non-squashing point changefeeds, so it's plausible someone would want to use a changefeed to e.g. make sure a user's balance never dips below $0 and charge them an overdraft fee if it does.  In that case \"resuming\" the changefeed by just re-sending the initial value doesn't get you what you want."
