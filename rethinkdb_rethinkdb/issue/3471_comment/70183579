      "> If someone wants to do something special if the user's balance ever drops below zero, they should put that logic in the write queries.\r\n\r\nMaybe in that one example that would be reasonable because you'd only want one or two places where you update someone's balance.  In general, though, I think we should give people a way to write code that triggers whenever a certain change happens without forcing them to attach a copy of that code to all the write queries that could conceivably cause such a change."
