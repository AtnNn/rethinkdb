      "We could easily use disk-backed queues and have the limit configurable to arbitrary values.\r\nI think there should be *some* limit though (I wouldn't object to having a special \"no limit\" option however). I see the limit more as a feature than a limitation. It saves users from having to garbage-collect old named changefeeds that have been left behind by crashed or faulty clients."
