      "@kofalt: That's a really good point. In fact, we should probably never dump the entire table when the user tries to resume a changefeed. If the server expired the changefeed, it should always throw an error instead of dumping the table. The client can catch this error and start a new changefeed with `return_initial=True` if they want a full-table dump. Then when we switch to a backfilling-based implementation, from the client's point of view it looks like it's no longer possible for changefeeds to expire."
