      "The original rationale was that I wanted the two different implementation to expose exactly the same API to the user. But the performance characteristics are different enough that I agree it's not a good idea.\r\n\r\nBackfill-based feeds are strictly better than ring-buffer-based feeds from the user's point of view. The problem is that backfill-based feeds are a lot more complicated to implement on the server side. That's the reason @mlucy suggested ring-buffer-based feeds in the first place."
