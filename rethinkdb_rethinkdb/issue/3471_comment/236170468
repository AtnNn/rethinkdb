      "If RethinkDB integrated reliable changefeed consumption with resume feature, and group consumption with load-balancing feature, we would immediately replace Kafka for it.\r\n\r\nBut it does only half of the job. We thought using it for our web front-ends, but the \"changefeed\" feature would overlap with the \"kafka\" event notifications (notification of changes) and we do not want to add up on the techno stack.\r\n\r\nMaking this changefeed feature be more cluster friendly, is, IMO, a high priority.\r\n\r\nI am interested for any RethinkDB alternative that provides delivery guarantees and Kafka-like  consumption feature of changes. It sounds to me like an unicorn so far..."
