      "> There are multiple ways to access a cursor, though (`each` in js, for example, and Python's iteration machinery)\r\n\r\nActually that might be a problem. If the iterator throws, it might be tricky for the user to resume where they've left of in a loop after calling `resume`.\r\n\r\nThat's a point in favor of @timmaxw proposal. `resume` has the benefit of being visible, but making cursors transparently reconnect indeed sounds like the nicer interface."
