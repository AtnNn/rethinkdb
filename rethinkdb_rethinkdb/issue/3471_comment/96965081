      "> If `resumable` is set to `true` and `run` returns a cursor, then that cursor will have a new method `resume` on it.\r\n\r\nI think the cursor should always have a method `resume` on it, and it should throw an error if called on a cursor that isn't resumable. I think adopting monkey patching for this is a bad idea.\r\n\r\n> We'll pick some long default timeout (like an hour), and if you're disconnected from a resumable feed for longer than that it's destroyed.\r\n\r\nIs there a compelling reason not to leave this up to TCP? If there isn't, I think we should just destroy the feed when TCP closes the connection due to idleness."
