      "If we later want to switch to a replication timestamp based implementation, keeping track of changefeeds on the server has the disadvantage of requiring additional intra-cluster synchronization if we want it to survive server failures.\r\n\r\nWith the client managing a token (which would contain a set of timestamps), it's easy to resume a changefeed on any server, even after a primary failure."
