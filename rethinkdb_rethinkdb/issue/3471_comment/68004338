      "You guys had mentioned something like `r.db('system').table('changefeeds')` that is populated with changefeeds that are currently active. Maybe with some kind of changefeed pseudotype for the documents that the drivers can convert into a cursor:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{id: <feed_uuid>\r\n feed: <FEED_PSEUDOTYPE>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the drivers could maybe do something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor item in r.db('system').table('changefeeds').get(<feed_uuid>)('feed'):\r\n    print item['new_val'], item['old_val']\r\n```"
