      "> Wait, so will we not provide a default value if the user doesn't specify one?\r\n\r\nNo we will, but we only have to provide one pair of default values for `resume_limit_seconds` and the initial backoff. If we didn't allow the user to specify the initial backoff, we would have to pick a reasonable value based on `resume_limit_seconds` according to some sort of heuristics.\r\n\r\nMy assumption is that the initial backoff should be different for cases where a user wants to retry for an hour (i.e. `resume_limit_seconds` = 1 hour) and those where a user is more concerned about realtime guarantees and wants to fail after 1 second.\r\nIf we provide `resume_retry_seconds` we avoid having to speculate about the user's intention, and can just let them pick the values."
