      "@coffeemug \r\nI agree that we should avoid exposing sharding details to the user. My question in 1 was with respect to how we would *actually* implement the timestamp. I think we need the individual ranges there because there's no single synchronized (replication) timestamp across different shards.\r\n\r\nI think solving the snapshot memory issue is worth looking into. It might not actually be that difficult to do.\r\nTerminating the changefeed if the user is too far behind is annoying. On large tables transferring the initial results might well take so long that no matter what the user does, the changefeed will be aborted before it even gets a chance to catch up with more recent writes. At that point the feature becomes unusable.\r\nIf we want this feature to make changefeeds more reliable for replication purposes, that is probably not the way to go."
