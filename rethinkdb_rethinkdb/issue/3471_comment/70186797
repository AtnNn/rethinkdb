      "There were some good comments upthread about different use cases for feeds that might want to restart, and feeds that will never care about restarting.\r\n\r\nIn that resumption case, I cannot (off the top of my head) envision a case where I'd **both** want to restart the feed, **and** be able to continue without errors if the feed was actually gone, or going to dump the whole table at me.\r\n\r\nAn arbitrarily-sized ring buffer can handle blips in connectivity, but the same `if place in feed lost, then catastrophic loss of state` logic would have to be written by an app consuming the feed as if the buffer were not in place.\r\n\r\nIt would follow that persistent, hard-guarantee feeds may inherently be a more valuable feature."
