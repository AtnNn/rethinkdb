      "A few thoughts:\r\n\r\n- I like the idea of `rethinkdb.feeds` table and think it's necessary (this doesn't seem controversial)\r\n- I think asking the client to ack changes would significantly complicate the usage; I think it would be best not to do this if we can get away with it\r\n- I like the `since` optarg; we can also reuse it later when we add the timestamp-based resumable feeds api\r\n- The user could tell if there is a gap in the feed because if we overflow the array size limit boundary, we should close the feed (unless I misunderstood what @timmaxw meant)"
