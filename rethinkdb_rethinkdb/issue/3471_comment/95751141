      "I agree with @mlucy's latest summary. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- I don't think we should support acks for now. This sounds complicated (for us and for the user), it's not clear that people want it (yet), etc. I think we should hold off on it, and add it later if it turns out to be important.\r\n- I'd always include a token as part of a persistent feed, and allow users to pass an optional `since` argument.\r\n- I think we should keep things in RAM for the first implementation (and either use the array size limit, or a similar optarg). If the queue overflows, we should return an error when someone passes a token that's earlier than the data we have. (We can fix that later by using btree timestamps).\r\n- I like mirroring the index API. I'd call the functions `feed_*`, not `changefeed_*`, though. Shorter is better, and IMO it's just as clear.\r\n- A pseudotable API to feeds would still be really nice, but we can potentially leave it out as long as we have a term to list feeds. We can add a pseudotable later (along with one for indexes).\r\n\r\nThis seems pretty reasonable to me, I wouldn't overcomplicate things beyond this. We can always expand the API later as we understand the use cases better."
