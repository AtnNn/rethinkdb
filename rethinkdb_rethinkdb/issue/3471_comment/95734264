      "@deontologician -- I'm sort of torn on whether or not re-using tables would be good here.  On the one hand we already have a lot of support for them, on the other hand they're really complicated and were meant for a different use case.\r\n\r\nIMO we should do this in memory for the first version, and if people really want larger queues or more persistence we can easily keep the same API but change it to use a table or a disk-backed queue or something custom."
