      "I think we should have a parameter `feed_size_limit` that affects the size of the queue for both resumable and non-resumable changefeeds (this is currently unconfigurable for non-resumable changefeeds; the array size limit doesn't change the queue size because people thought it was confusing).  I don't think we need a `resume_size_limit` for anything except changefeeds because we don't have values streaming in; we can just wait to issue the next read.\r\n\r\nI think `resume_time_limit` makes sense.  I'm not sure we even need `resume_initial_retry_interval`; I think we should just pick something reasonable and if people want to do something else (which probably basically nobody will) they can use `resumable: 'manual'`."
