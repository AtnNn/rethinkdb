      ":+1: \r\n\r\nI'm very interested in this feature. I really want to deploy RethinkDB in production (real time weather display for aviation) but without durable changefeed's it doesn't have the safety I need. \r\n\r\nEspecially happy to see return_initial. Right now I have to subscribe to a changefeed, query the database and then \"playback\" the changes before I have a safe view into the data."
