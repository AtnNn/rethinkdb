      "@danielmewes We are currently using PouchDB/CouchDB to replicate between different database instances in different locations for a retail POS software that just can't be offline - and, being in Brazil, our internet service providers are not reliable at all, so we can't have only a central database.\r\n\r\nThat said, I believe having changefeeds resumability (**if** we can guarantee the changes' delivery) would make it possible to have our own multi-master replication between RethinkDB instances, but we'd need it to survive server and client restarts (oh, and I know there's a lot more in error handling and conflict resolution to achieve this goal).\r\n\r\nProbably this use case is beyong what is expected with the changefeeds resumability, I just imagined the possibility of a multi-master replication would allow us to migrate our few non-RethinkDB databases to RethinkDB."
