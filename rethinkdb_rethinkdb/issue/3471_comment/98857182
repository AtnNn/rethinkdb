      "> I don't think we should do that, it would be pretty surprising to me (at least in Ruby).  The interface I would expect would be `'auto' | 'manual' | nil`, optionally with `false` as a synonym for `nil`.\r\n\r\nFair enough. I don't feel strongly either way.\r\n\r\nI think we should have `resume_retry_seconds`. If for nothing else, it gives us a well visible place in the documentation to explain our backoff logic. It also makes our lives easier, since we don't have to deal with deducing the initial backoff value from the `resume_limit_seconds` parameter."
