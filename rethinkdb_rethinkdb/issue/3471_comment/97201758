      "I think I prefer an explicit `resume`, for a couple of reasons. Automatically reconnecting cursors seem to magical to me -- I'd feel like I don't understand what's going on and I'd be worries about using the feature. Explicit `resume` makes me feel safe, and makes everything clear, in a way automatically resuming cursors do not.\r\n\r\nAlso, I wouldn't underestimate visibility and perception. I think explicit `resume` has some intangible benefits that we shouldn't discount.\r\n\r\n(I'm not entirely opposed to automatically reconnecting cursors, but my gut feeling is that I like that a lot less than `resume`. It might be because I was excited about the command though and my mind is resistant to changing something I was excited about -- I'm not sure.)"
