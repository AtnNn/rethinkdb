      "I think we shouldn't limit the changefeed buffer size artificially. We could raise an issue at some user-specified threshold if the changefeed is just growing and growing and filling up the disk, and/or we could raise an issue if there are unconsumed changes in the feed and it's been some threshold amount of time since one was consumed.\r\n\r\nThere may be some very high volume changefeeds, and even short disconnections could result in 100K changes coming though and destroying the utility of resumable changefeeds altogether."
