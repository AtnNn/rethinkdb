      "Requiring to reconnect to the same server interacts really badly with connection pools, and I think we should invest the time to make that not be necessary.\r\n\r\nCould the changefeed server_t on the primary keep the queues of named changefeeds and have the client_t on the parsing node(s) send it acks after a ReQL client has read a batch to allow it to discard old changes?\r\n\r\nI'm ok with always sending the token, and not supporting explicit acks in the first revision.\r\n\r\n`feet_create`, `feed_drop`, `feed_list` and `feed` sound good to me."
