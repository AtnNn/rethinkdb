      "Would it be ok to hold off on this issue until more of reql-admin (and, by virtue of passing time, new web design) is done? We're referring to the `reconfigure` command on the landing page (and giving it a significant voice), so this is one bit that I think we should take time to think about. But it's hard to do until the landing page is really ready. We can make a decision now if it's absolutely necessary, but if at all possible I'd prefer to leave the command as is, and then come back to it later when more stuff is done. Would that work?"
