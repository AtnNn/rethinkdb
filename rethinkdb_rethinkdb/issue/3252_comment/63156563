      "I don't have an issue with `reconfigure`, if that's what it does. It makes sense -- `reconfigure` will reconfigure the table based on some ideal suggestion, and if I'm nervous, I run it with `dry_run`.\r\n\r\nThis assumes that a configuration (as I understand it) is fairly complex in its scope, fundamental to a table, and hard to sum up via a word like `redistribute`."
