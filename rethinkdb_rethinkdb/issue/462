Set multiple replicas in universe\n4. Access admin cli and try to pin one of the shard's masters\n\nCurrent behavior: the system says you can't pin masters because it's not in the table's primary datacenter\n\nExpected behavior: allow pinning because when the table is in universe the user should be able to pin anywhere.\n\nThis is low priority, so leaving in backlog until this matters to someone.\n"
