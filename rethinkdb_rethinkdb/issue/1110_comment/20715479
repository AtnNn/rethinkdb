      "We think we've identified the source of this issue. We use python subprocess.call with stdout=PIPE on which the documentation has this to say:\r\n\r\n> Note Do not use stdout=PIPE or stderr=PIPE with this function. As the pipes are not being read in the current process, the child process may block if it generates enough output to a pipe to fill up the OS pipe buffer.\r\n\r\nIt's probably only showing up on OSX because the OSX pipe buffer is smaller than the linux one."
