      "There is currently no way of suppressing any messages. However, without knowing anything about the details of your monitoring system, my first reaction is that it would probably be better to use a driver to open a connection (not much more costly then what you are already doing), and then send a trivial query (e.g.: `r.expr(1).run(conn)`). You can still distinguish failure-to-connect from failure-to-process based on the error class that comes back. From my quick read on creating `nagios` plugins that should not be too difficult to do, assuming you can install the proper driver on the `nagios` server.\r\n\r\nI am going to close this issue, but make an additional comment in #4628 to make sure we cover this sort of case when we go to a more full-featured logger. Feel free to ask additional questions here if you want."
