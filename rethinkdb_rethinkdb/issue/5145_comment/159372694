      "@JBodkin In theory the message should no longer appear if you make the health check send the correct cluster header \"RethinkDB cluster\\n\". In a quick experiment I couldn't get this working though.\r\n\r\nFor me, using Nagios' `check_tcp` actually doesn't generate the warnings. I think it might be disconnecting before RethinkDB gets to the part where it verifies the header, but I'm not sure. It's probably timing dependent."
