      "And yet again, today we got hit by the network traffic going to proxies bug. We didn't manually run any reconfigure(), but took one node down for maintenance, and one table had 3 shards, 4 replicas. However, taking this node down triggered a long backfill on TWO nodes, so for that one shard, we suddenly had 1 available, 1 offline and 2 backfilling replicas.\r\n\r\n...this shouldn't happen, right?"
