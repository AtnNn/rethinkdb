      "Thanks for the graphs and further details @analytik .\r\n\r\nMy hypothesis would be that we have some edge case in the backfilling code that causes it to get stuck without making progress, going in some kind of tight loop between the backfill sender and receiver. The backfill code was designed specifically so that it would always make some progress with every message that's exchanged between the two peers, but there might be a problem with that logic.\r\n\r\nThis could explain the stale backfill jobs in the `jobs` table, the high network traffic, and probably the cluster slowdown as well (since a very quickly looping backfill might generate a lot of load on the server)."
