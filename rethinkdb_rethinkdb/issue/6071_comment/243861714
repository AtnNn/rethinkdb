      "I don't think 2.3.5 will do anything for this, since we haven't changed the backfill logic in that. The only thing that I could theoretically imagine is that the stuck backfills would happen as a side-effect of a bug in 2.3.4 (and earlier) that could cause reads to return empty data (fixed in 2.3.5 through https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/6033 ). I'm not 100% sure how the backfill code would handle that, so this is just an extremely vague guess. It's probably more likely that there's something else wrong."
