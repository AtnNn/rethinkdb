      "We're forming a new theory, that the \"stuck\" backfills are actually correct, and rethinkdb UI / system tables incorrectly report those tables as fully available. Today we had some tables with 5 shards, 5 replicas unavailable after restarting one server, because even when they were 25/25 available, after the restart there was a lot of backfilling shards (disproportionately to number of writes happening while the server was getting restarted - if there were any changes in the table, in was 0~20 documents).\r\n\r\nAlso, those tables that have stuck backfills and appear fully ready, will have more stuck backfills when you reconfigure them."
