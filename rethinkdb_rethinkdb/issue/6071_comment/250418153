      "Also, Admin UI sometimes ignores us when we change replicas or shards from the table view. It shows green progress bar at 100% with a check mark next to it for a few seconds, like it normally does when reconfiguring, but then the configuration doesn't change. Is this a separate UI bug? Happens both in current Chrome and Firefox versions about 20% of the time."
