      "I'm wondering if we are seeing the same thing.\r\n\r\nI'm in the process of moving the data directory of our rethinkdb cluster, using the following procedure:\r\n\r\n1. Take down one server at a time\r\n2. Copy the data directory, changing the config (~5 mins)\r\n3. Restart the server\r\n\r\nThe cluster is in sync when I start the process. It's very surprising that the server then backfills for an hour or more when the server comes back up. \r\n\r\nWe also experience that when the server comes back up one of the other replicas goes into backfilling as well making the table unavailable for a while."
