      "Profiling indicates that the slow `count()` is because we use the slow `poll(2)` interface on OS X, while we use `epoll` on Linux which is a lot more efficient. That's why the count takes 1 second on Linux, but 20 seconds on OS X. We'll have to implement support for `kqueue`/`kevent`, which is the OS X equivalent to `epoll` on Linux. I will open a separate issue for that.\r\n\r\nThis does not really explain why the inserts are so slow for @pzol."
