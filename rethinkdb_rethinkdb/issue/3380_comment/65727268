      "@pzol Just a quick update: the `kqueue` event queue will likely ship with the next release of RethinkDB (1.16). On my machine that change reduced the `count()` query's runtime from >18 seconds to about 3 seconds. I expect that many other queries are going to run significantly faster with it on Mac as well.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it could have anything to do with the slow inserts, but probably not."
