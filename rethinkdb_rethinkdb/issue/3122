        "@mlucy says in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3089#issuecomment-57043752 that we should do this if it's easy.  The reason is that datum_stream_t's are use-once objects, so it's kind of freaky that we'd pull them out of a val_t by \"copying\" the pointer out and then pretending the val_t is still a valid object.\r\n"
