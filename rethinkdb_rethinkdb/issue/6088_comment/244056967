      "I haven't actually tried connecting to RethinkDB via AWS Lambda, but I know there's a VPC song and dance you have to perform to be able to talk to EC2, for example: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/vpc.html\r\n\r\nIf your Elastic IP is accessible to the open web (not that I would recommend this) and you're trying to connect that way, I believe you would need a NAT Gateway: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/vpc.html#vpc-internet\r\n\r\nIf you've already done all that, based on your last sentence you may be holding onto a single connection too long? Are you re-connecting every time the Lambda function is invoked? I've never encountered a problem with Lambda that involved re-uploading the function to fix it.\r\n\r\nIt would definitely be helpful to post what you find back here so others can learn from it!"
