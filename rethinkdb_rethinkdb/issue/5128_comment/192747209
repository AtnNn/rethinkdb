      "+1\r\n\r\nFWIW - I agree that Jackson may be a preferable choice since it is already bundled with a lot of frameworks, as @dbolotin pointed out. For an example, the Play framework's Json serialization [implementation](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/master/framework/src/play-json/src/main/java/play/libs/Json.java) is fairly straight foreword and handles most use cases. Call `Json.toJson` to get the JSON representation, which can then be converted to a `String` and `Json.fromJson` to get the object model representation."
