      "Thanks for the PR @katafrakt, and sorry it took us a while to get back to you.\r\n\r\nHave you signed our CLA yet? If not, you can do this online at http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/ . We require the CLA for legal reasons before we can merge a pull request.\r\n\r\nI believe the Twisted dependency is only for a certain set of tests. @larkost Is that right?\r\nThere are also some tests that require Tornado and gevent on Python, and EventMachine on Ruby. You might want to mention those too.\r\n\r\nAssigning @larkost for further review."
