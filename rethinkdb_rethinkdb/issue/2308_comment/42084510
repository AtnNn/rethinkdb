      "Also as an intermediate step, we can adapt the macros to still generate the serialization and deserialization functions, but generate the latter one under a special version-dependent name. E.g. instead of `deserialize()`, it would generate a function `deserialize_ver_1()` if the version 1 is passed to the RDB_MAKE_ME_SERIALIZABLE macro.\r\n\r\nThe `deserialize()` function would still have to be implemented manually, but could call the automatically generated `deserialize_ver_1()` if it detects that version (and do something different for older versions)."
