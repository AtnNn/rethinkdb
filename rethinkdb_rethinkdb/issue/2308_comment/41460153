      "This sounds like an awsome plan. I am sure there is a pain of some level keeping old versions supports around but at some point users are going to get fustrated with having to dump and restore there cluster and depending on how much data they have it may not be a real possiablity. If this can make it into 1.13 and then allow for 1.12.x to be assumed then could allow all the users who waited on 1.12 not to feel thrown around."
