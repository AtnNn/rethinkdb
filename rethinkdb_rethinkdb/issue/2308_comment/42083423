      "@srh As @mlucy says, having deserialization support for multiple versions is still a very manual process. We will improve that later.\r\nThe important part is that we now have version numbers in the serialized data, so we *can* add a deserialization function that handles different versions if we for example need to do that to fix a bug in an LTS release. Before it wasn't even possible to detect which version an object is in."
