      "I just looked at the change in review 1475 and I don't get how this is supposed to work.  So the serialization macros now take an integer for the version number.  And then what?  What happens if we want to add a field?  We can't just increase the version number.  And why is the version number 16 bits and not 8 bits?  There is no reason for it to be 16 bits."
