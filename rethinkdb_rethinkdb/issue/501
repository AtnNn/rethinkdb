        "Hi all,\r\n\r\nHow to uninstall rethinkdb 1.3?\r\nI want to upgrade to 1.4.\r\n\r\nI run below two commands but there is nothing for me to delete in this location:\r\n```\r\nrm /usr/local/bin/rethinkdb\r\nrm -r /usr/local/share/rethinkdb\r\n```\r\n\r\nI dont have any data so i have removed this folder\r\n```\r\nrm -r rethinkdb_data\r\n```\r\nNow i tried to install 1.4 but i am getting alert saying\r\n\"RethinkDB can\8217t be installed on this computer.\"\r\n\r\nIn terminal, i have given rethinkdb command, to check whether it is uninstalled or not.\r\nIt is running old verion.\r\n\r\nHow to uninstall this old version and install new?\r\n\r\nPS\r\nI tried to ask this in stack overflow as this may not be issue of rethinkdb but i could not find rethinkdb tag. I tried to create but it seems one need to have at least 1500 points to create a new tag. May be you guys can create a rethinkdb tag in stackoverflow."
