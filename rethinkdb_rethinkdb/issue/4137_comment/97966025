      "Weird. I'm not sure what else could cause other programs on the system to become unresponsive.\r\nCould it be that it's only going into swap while you're running the insert query?\r\n\r\n@digi604 What do the documents look like that you're inserting? What is their average size, and do they have any nested arrays or objects?\r\nIs there a chance you could post an example document?\r\nA batch size of 10,000 might be a bit much, but 200 generally sounds reasonable.\r\n\r\nMy only other guess for the impact on other processes would be the i/o scheduler getting overwhelmed by the many concurrent i/o transactions that RethinkDB performs...\r\n\r\n@digi604 You can try running RethinkDB with the `--io-threads 8` option. If i/o contention is the issue, that will likely reduce RethinkDB's impact on the rest of the system.\r\nIt wouldn't explain why RethinkDB itself gets so slow though. "
