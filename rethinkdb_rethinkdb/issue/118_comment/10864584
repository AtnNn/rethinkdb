      "I thought we'd agreed to eventually having orderBy and sort where orderBy takes an attribute on which we have an index and sort takes a comparison function. The waters were muddied when we decided for some reason to make orderby polymorphic and its implementation based on a sort of the sequence, destroying the distinction and eliminating the performance gains that were to be had with orderBy.\r\n\r\nCan we perhaps add a new issue to post_protobuf_improvements that adds a sort builtin and restores this distinction?"
