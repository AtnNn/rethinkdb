      "I think that orderby can *only* take a list of ascending or descending attributes, not an arbitrary expression.  It looks like the problem here is that the javascript client is generating an invalid protobuf since `r('@')` isn't an attribute.  (I'm guessing, of course.)\r\n\r\nHopefully the new protobuf spec will be less susceptible to this sort of mistake."
