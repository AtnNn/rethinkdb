      "> Taking and storing all these backtraces is of course slightly costly, so we would probably only do it in debug mode.\r\n\r\nI of course agree with doing this only in debug mode, but I wanted to point out that this may not be as costly as it appears. Our lazy backtrace is pretty darn fast, since it only stores memory pointers and does symbol resolution only when necessary."
