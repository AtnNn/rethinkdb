        "I'm trying to \"upsert\" a row (i.e. insert if it doesn't exist and update if it does) with the twist that I need to increment a sequence number field. I tried insert() with conflict:update but i can make the add(1) work. Is there an alternate formulation or could insert be made to accept r.row?\nSpecifically:\n\n```\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"t\").insert(\n  {foo:\"bar\", seq: r.row(\"seq\").add(1).default(0)},\n  {conflict:\"update\"})\n```\n\nproduces:\n\n```\ne: r.row is not defined in this context in:\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"t\").insert({\"foo\": \"bar\", \"seq\": r.row(\"seq\").add(1).default(0)}, {\"conflict\": \"update\"})\n                                                     ^^^^^                                                   \n```\n"
