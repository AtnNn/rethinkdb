      "@danielmewes great, thanks!\r\n\r\nI'd also like to potentially discuss a somewhat more involved future solution for this problem. Would it be out of the question to involve a handshake of sorts on these auto reconnects? Basically, the auto reconnecter would reconnect to a node and verify that the node name is the same in order to complete the reconnect.  I'm just sort of spitballing here, but thought I'd get the conversation started in terms of thinking about why this might/might not be a good idea.\r\n\r\n"
