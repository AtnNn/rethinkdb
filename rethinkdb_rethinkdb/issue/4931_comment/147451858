      "@danielmewes this is now happening consistently. In most cases we can just reboot, however we have also run into cases where this crash occurs before replicas are established and then we run into all sorts of trouble.\r\n\r\nthe bug seems to be related to the infinite loop in `logs_artificial_table_backend_t::cfeed_machinery_t::run` continuously adding 1 to the `min_time` timespec. I'm willing to do the work to fix the bug, if someone from your team maybe has a second to discuss the issue on IRC first (to make sure I'm headed in the right direction)?"
