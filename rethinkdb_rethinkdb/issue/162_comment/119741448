      "I'm pretty sure it doesn't work with IE10 because IE10 doesn't support `__proto__`, which is used in TermBase's constructor.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/89144e1b3689667a1fd9d295faa60c9473a99413/drivers/javascript/ast.coffee#L56\r\n\r\nRemoving that line gives me the same error in chrome that I get in IE10, so I'm fairly sure it's a culprit.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to work out how to get the same behavior without `__proto__`, but I'm not sure what that constructor is doing exactly."
