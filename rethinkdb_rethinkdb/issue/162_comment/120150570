      "@danielmewes Yes, it's important for my use case with [rethinkdb-websocket-client](https://github.com/mikemintz/rethinkdb-websocket-client), which wraps the official driver for use in the browser. But it sounds like the javascript API would have to change in order to support that, which is pretty unfortunate.\r\n\r\nUnless there's another way to allow function calls on objects with prototypes, it's probably best not to change it. Ideally it would check if `__proto__` is supported in the current environment, and if not, fail gracefully in a way that only disables the `bracket` shorthand.\r\n\r\n@neumino I've tried changing TermBase to have an empty constructor (and a variety of other implementations) and I still get errors, e.g. `orderBy` is not a function. I don't have any bracket operations in my query. So I think there is more to do in order to get everything else working without `__proto__`."
