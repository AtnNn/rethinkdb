      "This should be possible, but may require significant refactoring. `jQuery`, for example, implements this same sort of API and they do so without modifying `__proto__`. Take a look at the code [here](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L18).\r\n\r\nTheir implementation is arguably cleaner than how things are currently being done in `ast.coffee`, but like I said this would require a decent amount of work not a quick-fix."
