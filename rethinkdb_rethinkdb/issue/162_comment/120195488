      "The other IE10 issues were my own unrelated issues.\r\n\r\nAfter taking @neumino's suggestion to replace the TermBase constructor, and adding explicit `.bracket(...)` calls to my queries, the driver works in IE10.\r\n\r\nWould it be acceptable to modify the TermBase constructor, to something like this (sorry, not familiar with coffeescript so hopefully my syntax is right)?\r\n\r\n```coffeescript\r\nconstructor: ->\r\n    if ({})['__proto__']\r\n        self = (ar (field) -> self.bracket(field))\r\n        self.__proto__ = @.__proto__\r\n        return self\r\n    else\r\n        return this\r\n```"
