      "Once we get #3636 in, it would be trivial for users to add queries to a separate table, and you could theoretically do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.db('queries').table('app').get('filter_query').eval().run(conn)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis isn't quite what you suggested here, but it's close.  It would be useful if we could parameterize the query, or store some subset of the Term tree from a given query - but I suppose that depends on how #3636 is settled."
