      "I'm not sure if the `jobs` table is a good place for storing cron jobs. Currently `jobs` only contains things that are currently running, and having scheduled tasks in there would be a pretty big jump from that.\r\n\r\nWe should probably have a separate pseudo table (`tasks` or `scheduled_queries` or something) for that."
