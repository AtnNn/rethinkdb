        "We currently have `keys_read` and `keys_set` that have the number of reads/writes to a given btree within the past second.\r\n\r\nFor external monitoring tools, having the total number since startup of the server is often more convenient to use.\r\n\r\nI would like to add this to a 1.13 point release, since this is relevant for a monitoring tool that's being developed for RethinkDB at this moment by @wojons.\r\n\r\nIt's already implemented in branch daniel_total_keys_perfmon."
