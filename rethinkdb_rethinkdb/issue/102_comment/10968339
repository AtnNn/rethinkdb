      "Unfortunately, implicit variable has not been made obsolete in the general case. Having to type `function ...` in js just to get everyone with age older than 30, for example, unfortunately isn't acceptable.\r\n\r\nI talked to @mlucy about this and at the time we thought the best option here is to return a sensible error to the user. Now that I think about it, this will prevent the user from using `function` syntax here, so perhaps a better solution is to return warnings and just bind contexts to empty objects like we do now."
