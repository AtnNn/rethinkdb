      "`r.row` is *explicit*. No longer is the shortcut `r` itself an implicit reference to the current row. By making this clear more people will be inclined to use the helpful shortcut rather than ignore it or puzzle about what it's suppose to mean.\r\n\r\nThe main difference though is in the implementation. All the complicated hacks surrounding overloading the module name can go away and the new shortcut simply wraps the new way of doing things."
