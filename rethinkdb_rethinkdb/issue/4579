Talking with @deontologician it is because that is what we would auto-fill if you hit `<tab>`. I was actually surprised that you could hit `<tab>` to get auto-fill, so the UI on that could probably be better. Together we both thought that something modeled on `fish` shell's version might be better:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2015-07-24 at 3 41 50 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7431361/8886115/9c5f5fb2-321a-11e5-91c7-e102bd910c56.png)\r\n\r\nMy take on how we could integrate this:\r\n- hitting `<tab>` the first time would show the options as it does now, but fill the currently selected completion in-line in a light color (e.g.: grey)\r\n- subsequent `<tab>`s would cycle through the completion options\r\n- the forward row key would make the selection\r\n- delete would back out of the auto-fill\r\n- further typing would keep up the auto-fill box, filtering it as appropriate"
