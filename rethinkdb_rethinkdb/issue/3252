        "@coffeemug doesn't like the name `table.reconfigure`. We should come up with a better name. Here are some ideas to get the juices flowing: `make_config`, `config_genie`, `generate_config`, `distribute`, `redistribute`, `rebalance`, `suggest_config`, `auto_config`, `smart_config`.\n\nIf we pick a name like `suggest_config`, we could have it default to `dry_run = False`.\n"
