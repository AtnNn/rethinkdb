        "The version of libprotobuf we use (implicitly at least) is 2.4.1 because that's what's in the ubuntu repositories. We should look into upgrading to 2.5.0. It contains some speed upgrades and interface changes I'd like to take advantage of.\r\n\r\n@atnnn, how hard would it be to link against the newer libprotobuf when building rethinkdb? This is also relevant to building the new python driver backend. Pip only has version 2.5.0 by the way so the distributed version of the python driver will be using it anyway."
