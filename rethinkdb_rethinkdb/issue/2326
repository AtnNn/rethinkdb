        "was speaking with @danielmewes and @Tryneus :\n\nThe idea of this is that for the run feild just like how there is useoutofdate and so on the use closest would use an updated version of the heartbeat to know which nodes it has the lowest latancy to and it when quries came in with use closest it would then route to the table closest based on latancy wise. Its not perfect since we dont know how busy that node is but its a start on getting more routing options in place.\n"
