        "Currently the branch history is append-only, so it grows without bound. We should garbage-collect it by deleting branches that all replicas are known to be descended from.\n\nProbably the right way to do this is to have the `contract_coordinator_t` garbage collect its own branch history and have the `contract_executor_t`s copy those changes. We'll have to rewrite all the branch-history manipulation functions so that they don't crash when the history is incomplete.\n"
