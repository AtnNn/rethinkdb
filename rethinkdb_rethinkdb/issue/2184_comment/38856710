      "So, this isn't documented anywhere, but there's a `batch_conf` optarg which lets you set these things.  If you write `query.run(batch_conf:{max_els:5, max_dur:50*1000})`, you'll get a batch back as soon as 5 rows are available or 50*1000 microseconds pass, whichever happens first.  (You can also use `max_size` to configure a maximum serialized size in bytes, which is what we use internally for most batch sizing.)"
