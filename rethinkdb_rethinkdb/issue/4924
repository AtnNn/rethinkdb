        "This is tested against 2.1.5 on ubuntu. I had hoped the `rethinkdb.jobs` change that made it in was just going to fix this one, but it doesn't seem to have. \n\nI'm running a set of automated integration tests against a single (unclustered) rethinkdb instance. My node module is creating a rather involved change feed on a given table, and each time I run the tests I get the following error:\n\n```\n     ReqlRuntimeError: Query terminated by the `rethinkdb.jobs` table in:\nr.db(\"03f13bd516e24299b19abde635a7fba2\").table(\"pool\").changes()\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n```\n\nThere's not really much else to go on here. Off the cuff a guess could be that the database isn't ready yet maybe? (You can see I'm generating dbs with a uuid for each test here). Any ideas?\n"
