      "It's not so much about ordering changes, but just that one document has left the top `limit` results, and another one has entered the top `limit` in its place. What their positions were/are is not directly reflected in the change notifications.\r\n\r\nWe could split a notification like this up into one removal of the form `{old_val: ..., new_val: null}`, followed by an addition of the form `{old_val: null, new_val: ...}`. However that would have the disadvantage that there are points when applying the changefeed stream during which you have fewer than `limit` elements in the result."
