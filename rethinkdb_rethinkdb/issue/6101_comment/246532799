      "@dan335 you're definitely seeing this result from the second query then. Ordered changefeeds (i.e. `.orderBy(...).limit(...)`) are a little different than typical changefeeds because you get notified of _positional changes_ in addition to the changes on individual documents. In your example, you're being notified that the doc in `old_val`'s position in the feed has been replaced by  `new_val` (since it's `lastPostDate` is now earlier than the previous document)."
