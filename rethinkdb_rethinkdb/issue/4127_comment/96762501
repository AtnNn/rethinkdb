      "Hi @digi604. We'll consider this as a proposal for one of the upcoming releases.\r\n\r\nA problem I could see with this is that we don't have a time difference type in ReQL at the moment. So if we automatically converted Python's timedelta type into a ReQL expression, we couldn't make it round-trip correctly (as in if you send a timedelta to the server, and then retrieve the value back, you wouldn't get it back as a timedelta).\r\n\r\nTwo alternatives:\r\n- we could special case subtraction and addition to convert the timedelta in the Python client into a number\r\n- we could catch attempts to send a timedelta object as part of a ReQL query and print a better error message, explaining that you have to use a number for subtracting or adding to times."
