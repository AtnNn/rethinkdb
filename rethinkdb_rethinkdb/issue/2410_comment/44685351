      "@janih First of all thanks for the additional info. The crash on the older machine is interesting. Did you restore the data dump using rethinkdb import?\r\nI know you had already sent us your table files. Is it possible that you can also provide us with the exact data dump that caused the crash on the older machine after importing and creating an index on it?\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky Can you set up another upload page/server for @janih please?"
