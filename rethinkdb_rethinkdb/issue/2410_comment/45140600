      "Hmm I could get a crash once, but wasn't able to repeat it since then.\r\nThis could theoretically be caused by #2500, but that's difficult to test without a reliable way to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n@janih: If I sent you a modified rethinkdb binary, could you install that and use it instead to see if it works better for you?"
