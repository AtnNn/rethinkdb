      "@janih I've recovered the faulty table `blog_item` to a state where it can be read again. If you need the data, I can make a copy available to you.\r\nI wouldn't trust the recovered data though. I found two cases of corruption where 2 and 4 bytes respectively in the table file were overwritten with seemingly random other data. These two were the cases where these corruptions stopped RethinkDB from reading the data. I would expect that some of the actual contents are also corrupted though.\r\n\r\nDo you have a chance to run a memory tester on your machine @janih (e.g. Memtest86+ http://www.memtest.org/ )? We will run more tests on our side, because this is obviously a very serious issue. Still I would like to make sure that it wasn't caused by faulty hardware in the first place."
