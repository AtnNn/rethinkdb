      "I still had no luck in reproducing on any file system other than ReiserFS with data journalling.\r\n\r\nAlso a late thank you @janih for running the test program. The fact that it passed in your case indicates that there is a different problem than the one that exists on ReiserFS+journalling.\r\nI will send you an email.\r\n\r\nHow is running with `--no-direct-io` working out for you so far?"
