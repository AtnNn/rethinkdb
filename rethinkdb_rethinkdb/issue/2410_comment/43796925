      "@janih Thank you for running Memtest. That's very helpful. So we have to assume that this was indeed caused by a bug in RethinkDB.\r\nI would like to reproduce your workload as closely as possible. Since I already have the data, I have only a few remaining questions:\r\n- You said you were inserting data when this happened. Were you inserting one document at a time or using batch inserts?\r\n- Were any other queries running at the same time? If yes, what types of queries? (e.g. something like `table().count()` ?)\r\n\r\nI'll send you an email with information on how to download the recovered data file."
