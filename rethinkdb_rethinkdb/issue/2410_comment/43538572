      "Hi @janih, thank you for the issue report.\r\n\r\nDo you think you could send us the RethinkDB data directory with the table files for further debugging on our end? If you had important data in the tables, we can also try to recover some of it, though it might not be completely possible.\r\nYou can try compressing the data directory and sending it in an email (daniel@rethinkdb.com). If the files are too big, we can arrange an upload page for you.\r\n\r\nAnother question: Were you running queries using the `r.literal()` term by any chance? This issue https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2399#issuecomment-43367260 has a similar crash message, and could be related (but only if you're using `r.literal()` in some of your queries)."
