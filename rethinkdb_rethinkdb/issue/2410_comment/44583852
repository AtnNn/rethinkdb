      "Thanks for the update @janih. I've had a test case running 24 hours for the past week, with the same RethinkDB binary you are using (and same data), but the bug hasn't shown up yet.\r\nThere must be some crucial piece I'm not replicating correctly about your scenario. I will try to improve it and add some more variation.\r\n\r\n@janih:\r\nNow that you got the issue again, did you again do any of the special things that you describe here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2410#issuecomment-43804174 (such as importing a complete table, mass-updating a previously empty field)? Or was it just regular inserts, updates and get/getAll/filter queries this time?\r\n\r\nWhich operating system are you using (Ubuntu 14.04?)?\r\nHow many cores does your machine have?\r\nWhich file system are the data files on? \r\nAre you using SSDs or rotational hard drives?\r\nCould you also paste the startup log of RethinkDB? Specifically I'm interested in the cache size it's using.\r\nHave you configured any special parameters for RethinkDB?\r\n\r\nThank you so much for sticking with us in debugging this issue @janih!\r\n\r\n(Also: Are you on our IRC channel by any chance? (#rethinkdb on Freenode). My name there is \"danielmewes\". Just in case I have additional questions later...)"
