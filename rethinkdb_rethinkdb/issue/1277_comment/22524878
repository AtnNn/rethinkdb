      "I said this on the google groups but I'll mention it here too. Getting smaller write throughput on a clustered setup than a single node instance isn't always unexpected. Clustering inherently increases latency of writes since it adds extra network hops and in many scenarios latency can be the bound on throughput. The easiest way to get out of these scenarios is to add more clients (and make sure that the clients aren't maxing out the CPU or the network pipe.)\r\n\r\nWhoever tests these should be careful to test those hypotheses first because it would be easy to spend a lot of time chasing down rabbit holes."
