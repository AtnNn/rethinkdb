      "So, it appears to be by design that the server continues on when failing to open the log file.  There is an issue tracker object for it, which will be visible in the web UI and admin CLI, and you may see this log statement:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPrevious message may not have been written to the log file (cannot open or find log file).\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn fact, the log component is already started first, but the problem is that daemon mode doesn't have a terminal to mirror these statements to, so they're simply lost.  I see two options:\r\n\r\n1. We keep the same behavior, but write a log statement to the terminal before daemonizing that we could not open the log file.\r\n2. We prevent the server from daemonizing when the log file is inaccessible.\r\n\r\nThoughts, @coffeemug?"
