      "This has been approved and merged into next in commit e7dcb8f, and cherry-picked into v1.11.x in commit 4928f06.  Will be in release 1.11.3.\r\n\r\nIn the code review, behavior was modified slightly.  Now, all invocations of rethinkdb that use a log file will refuse to start if the log file cannot be accessed at startup (regardless of daemonization).  This includes `create`, `serve`, and `proxy`."
