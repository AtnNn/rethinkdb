      "That should be the behavior in the other clients as well.\r\n\r\nThe real problem here, of course, is that our backtrace system is poorly conceived and executed. There are lots of little edge cases like this. Rather than track down each of these we should probably wait until the new protobuf spec is done. We'll be introducing a much more regularized way of providing backtraces. Type errors should include backtrace information as well."
