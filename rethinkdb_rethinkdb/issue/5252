I'll try to pin point when it happen, but perhaps the logs will mean something to you guys.\r\n\r\nBasically I am doing a lot of inserts that include heavy use of the `r.http` module.\r\nI make about 15 insert requests, with about 20 documents each. Each document is linked to about 5 different http request to enrich it's data.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1857466/12114581/a1f8943c-b3b3-11e5-8563-315be9b10134.png)"
