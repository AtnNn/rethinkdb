        "YCSB showed that point reads are a lot slower with RethinkDB than with MongoDB, at least when running on a single server.\n\nI profiled RethinkDB and nothing popped out particularly. However overall we seem to spend quite a bit of time on encoding and decoding cluster messages. If I look into rpc/connectivity/cluster.cc, there are a few comments there that talk about us doing too much copying. This is something we could certainly optimize.\n\nAnother potential bottleneck could be the Java driver that we use in YCSB. Looking at htop, the server clearly uses the majority of CPU though.\n"
