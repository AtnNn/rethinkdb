      "`batch_conf` will affect speed, but not the results you get back.  Changing this option can change the results you get (because rows will be discarded).  Also, `batch_conf` isn't really a good fit because it can be set per-continue-query, whereas this value has to be constant (since it's used when no query is active)."
