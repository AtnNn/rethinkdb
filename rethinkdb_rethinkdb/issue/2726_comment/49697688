      "Hum, I'm a little lost. Why would `merge` affect the results we get back?\r\nIf I set `merge: 1` (second), and more than 100k changes happened in one second, I would expect to receive multiple batch. I would consider merge as a maximum wait before sending the changes.\r\n\r\nI don't really have an opinion on a good term, but I would prefer avoiding `merge` since it's already a command like @AtnNn pointed out."
