      "> When we increase the protocol version from V to V+1, we will initially want all types to automatically assume the third case, i.e. the deserialization routine for V+1 should be the same as for V (assuming we haven't changed anything in the actual format yet).\r\n\r\nWe specialize the templated serialization/deserialization functions for older versions but use an unspecialized template for the latest version.\r\n"
