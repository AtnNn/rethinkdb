      "Even per-cluster-message versioning is silly because we know the version the messages will have up front thanks to the cluster version header.  A per-cluster-message versioning scheme would only be useful if we had fancy routing between cluster nodes.  We are capable of upgrading to this capability later.\r\n\r\nAs far as future protocol-compatibility goes, there is no need to make any changes visible on the cluster protocol.  The code, however, should be changed now to pass version number information close to callers of serialization and deserilaziation functions.\r\n\r\nOn disk it's a different matter.  We need version information there right away.\r\n\r\nI am currently implementing this in branches sam_2353 (which undoes the per-type versioning) and sam_2353_ii (forked off sam_2353) which will make disk data have sufficient versioning information, and make clustering code be made ready for being able to deal with multiple versions.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nAwaiting reviews 1510 and 1511."
