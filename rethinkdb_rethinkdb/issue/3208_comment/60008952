      "I think if we have to maintain a modified copy of the std::shared_ptr or boost::shared_ptr in our code base that's not a good idea.\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand we can factor out the changes we need to do in order to make it work in a non-atomic way on a per-object basis (e.g. let's say we define a class that's derived from std::shared_ptr and only overwrite certain functions) and we can do that in a mostly portable way, I think that would be good."
