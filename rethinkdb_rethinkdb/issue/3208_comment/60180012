      "Agree on not worth replacing if we can't get the easy atomics.\r\n\r\n@srh: type erasure means something completely different for C++ folks than it does for anyone else, which I'm sure is totally shocking.  The URL @VeXocide gave is quite reasonable, but basically I see it as \"when the full static type is too specific\".  For example, here, where there's no way to convert between a function `void(derived_t*)` to a function `void(base_t*)`, which makes upcasting problematic."
