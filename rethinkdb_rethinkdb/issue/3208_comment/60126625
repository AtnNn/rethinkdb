      "For the record: I see no reason for replacing our `counted_t` with std or boost `shared_ptr` at this moment.\r\nIf it was easy to get a non-atomic version of them in addition to an atomic version, the situation would be different. But since we can't, and have no particular reason to suspect that our `counted_t`s are bad in any way (as far as I understand, please correct me if I'm wrong), replacing `counted_t` would likely make our code *less* maintainable at no significant benefit."
