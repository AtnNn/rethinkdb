      "I actually don't think we *can* do allocation tracking for `term_t`, because of chicken-egg; by the time we can evaluate the query to figure out what the memory limits should be, we've already constructed all the `term_t`s.  It might be somewhat useful for the rewrite stuff, but I still don't think that happens in enough time."
