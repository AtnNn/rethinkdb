      "\"in the rare case where we use counted_t to point to something with subclasses\" You mean like `term_t`? `func_t`? `datum_stream_t`?  Having a `counted_t` point to a base class is not unusual.\r\n\r\nI have a version that uses custom type erasure and should reduce it to a `std::weak_ptr` and a virtual table pointer assuming a \"sufficiently smart compiler\", which is as low as it can possibly get."
