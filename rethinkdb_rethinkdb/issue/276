        "This is a minor remark. When I visit http://rethinkdb.com with Internet Explorer 9, it does not look right. Specifically, the navigation bar with the links intro, faqs, docs, api etc. appears in a light grey background, making the white text difficult to read.\r\n\r\nI know that Internet Explorer is not supported for the data explorer (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/75 ), but presumably it should work for the public website, shouldn't it?\r\n\r\n(Edit: sorry, it was Internet Explorer 9 not 7. The latest one that runs on Windows 7 anyways)"
