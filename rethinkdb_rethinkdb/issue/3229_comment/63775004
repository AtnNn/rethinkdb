      "I definitely think the table approach is better, but this particular implementation was pretty unclear at first glance (and even after thinking about it for a bit). I mostly agree with @timmaxw's feedback.\r\n\r\nHere is an example table that I think might be much clearer:\r\n\r\nShards | Replicas | Primary replica\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\n0 | eos_3143, eos_3145<sup>+</sup> | eos_3144 &rarr; eos_3143\r\n1 | eos_3144, eos_3143<sup>+</sup> | eos_3144\r\n2<sup>+</sup> | eos_3144, eos_3143 | eos_3144\r\n\r\nHere are some generalized rules for generation:\r\n\r\n- Always show all replicas in the diff, even if nothing changes\r\n- Use superscripts plus and minus to indicate added and removed replicas\r\n- Use superscripts plus and minus next to the shard number to indicate added and removed shards\r\n- For primary replicas use a right arrow to indicate a moved primary\r\n\r\nI think that makes it much clearer what's going on."
