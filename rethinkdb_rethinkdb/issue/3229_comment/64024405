      "> I think we should give the user a \"Reconfigure\" button. If they click it, they see two text-fields with number of shards and number of replicas. The diff updates live as they change the values, and they have buttons labeled \"Cancel\" and \"Apply\". I don't think we should ever show a \"Reshard\" button.\r\n\r\nThat would be insanely, mindbogglingly cool. I think it's worth holding the release for this (depending on how long it will take)."
