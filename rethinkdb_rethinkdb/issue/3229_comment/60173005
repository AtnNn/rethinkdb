      "It would be really cool if we could display a diff between the two configurations. When not reconfiguring, we could display a chart with all the shards:\r\n\r\n| Shard | Master | Replicas |\r\n|-------|--------|-----------|\r\n| 1 | A | B, C |\r\n| 2 | B | A, C |\r\n| 3 | C | A, B |\r\n\r\nNow, suppose they click \"Reconfigure\" and ask for four shards with one replica each. Then it would show a diff:\r\n\r\n| Shard | Master | Replicas |\r\n|-------|--------|-----------|\r\n| 1 | A | B, ~~C~~ |\r\n| 2 | B | C, ~~A~~ |\r\n| 3 | C | ~~A, B~~, **D** |\r\n| **4** | **D** | **A** |\r\n\r\nI think this would be really cool. (Presumably we would come up with a better way to do the diff than strikethrough and bold; perhaps red and green backgrounds?)"
