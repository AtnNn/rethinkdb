      "Very nice @deontologician! I really like the way the diff is presented there. :+1: \r\n\r\nI would be very interested in seeing this in the context of the overall table info page. The current layout has the neat property that you can change the shard and replica configuration in exactly the place where the current shard distribution and replication status respectively is shown.\r\n\r\nIf we otherwise leave the layout as it is, just moving the reconfiguration to the \"Server used by this table\" section, we might not account for users' actual work flows very well.\r\nIn many cases a user is not going to reconfigure a table because they actually want to change something about the server assignment (with the exception of recovering from a dead server, the web UI doesn't really allow doing that in the first place). Instead a more common use case is that a user wants to enable sharding, or change the number of replicas. So the first place they will look at for changing it will be the box on sharding / replication, not the servers being used box.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that in reality this isn't a problem at all. It's difficult to say without being able to actually try it out on the full page.\r\nI'm also hopeful that we can avoid the problem by doing a few simple changes to the visual layout of the page.\r\n@deontologician when you are back, we should sit together with @mglukhovsky and @coffeemug to experiment a bit with the page layout and presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n> How are you planning to show the case where the primary changes from one replica to another, but neither one is added or removed?\r\n\r\nI think a good option is to show one row for both the old and the new one, the old one in red and the new one in green directly below each other.\r\n(not sure if that was @deontologician 's plan, just saying)"
