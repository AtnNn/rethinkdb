      "> I think we should give the user a \"Reconfigure\" button. If they click it, they see two text-fields with number of shards and number of replicas. The diff updates live as they change the values, and they have buttons labeled \"Cancel\" and \"Apply\". I don't think we should ever show a \"Reshard\" button.\r\n\r\nThat sounds very cool.\r\n\r\nMy only concern is that we have pretty little development time left to get the web UI back into a fully working state. This change would require a redesign of the layout (currently replication and sharding are presented as separate features), and would probably have to go through a couple of iterations until it's really good from a UI perspective.\r\nFurthermore the more complex diffing algorithm that we need for sharding changes will take time to test and refine.\r\n\r\nI propose we first get a working version that keeps the current layout and requires minimal changes, keeping the separate buttons for resharding and replica reconfiguration.\r\nWe should show a diff for replication changes, but do something very simple for sharding changes.\r\n\r\nI think that will give us a much better idea of how things are actually going to feel when using them, and we can experiment with different layouts later."
