      "I guess my underlying concern is that without some idea of what the shard means (e.g. the split point for the shard) the fact that it gained or lost a replica doesn't mean much to the user. We could just as well say \"You'll now have x shards, and y replicas per shard. Server foo will now be involved in some way, and server bar will no longer be used by this table\". That way we aren't giving them information they don't care about. If they really care what servers are being assigned where, they won't be using the web-ui"
