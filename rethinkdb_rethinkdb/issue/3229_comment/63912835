      "Your example is unlikely to show up in practice. Shards can't swap places. In typical cases, the diff will take the form of some number of shards being inserted (if increasing the shard factor) or deleted (if decreasing the shard factor), and the remaining shards will have minor changes. In the weird corner cases, it's OK if we show a really verbose diff."
