      "OK, this is a mockup (done in css) of what I'm currently playing with. Basically, making the server configuration panel into the reconfigure panel for the live updates:\r\n\r\n![screen1](http://i.imgur.com/9s9a179.png)\r\n\r\n![screen](http://i.imgur.com/F4JapQd.png)\r\n\r\nThis is just a quick sketch, if we go this route, we would probably want distinct icons for the added/deleted replicas since it relies heavily on color (and we do want @VeXocide to be able to use it)"
