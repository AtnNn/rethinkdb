      "One good reason for showing the user which replicas are for which shards (instead of just a list of all the replicas together) is that it makes the level of redundancy clear. For example, the user can see at a glance that each shard has at least one replica in the `us_east` datacenter and at least one replica in the `us_west` datacenter. So the user does actually care about that information.\r\n\r\nAnother good reason is that it's nice if the format presented by the web UI is similar to the format of `table_config`."
