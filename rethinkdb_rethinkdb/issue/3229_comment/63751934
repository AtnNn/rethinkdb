      "* I prefer the table-based one.\r\n* I think the \"+\" and \"-\" signs and the red and green colors work great. They're better than strikethrough.\r\n* It's not obvious what the yellow highlight means.\r\n* Maybe we could put the word \"(primary)\" next to one of the servers, and then if the primary changes, we can put it in red next to the old primary and green next to the new primary?\r\n* I think sorting the servers would help. I suggest that we sort first by whether the server is added, removed, or unchanged; and then within each group, we put primaries (former primaries, future primaries, and unchanged primaries) before secondaries.\r\n* Putting primaries before non-primaries is especially useful when we're not displaying a diff, because then the user can scan the first column to see all the primaries"
