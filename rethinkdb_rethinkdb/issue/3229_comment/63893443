      "I think we shouldn't show the complete old and new configurations. The view is already cluttered enough already, especially if people use similar names for all of their servers (which is likely).\r\n\r\nI think the shards should be matched based on similarity of replicas. The diff will, in general, be very meaningful. Suppose the user has two shards, and wants three shards. The proposed configuration will have two shards that look very similar to the previous two shards, and a third shard that's different. So if the web UI detects that two shards look similar to their previous values, this will make it much easier for the user to understand what's going on. We'll have to think a bit about how to do the diff efficiently, but I'm confident that it can be done.\r\n\r\nI think we should give the user a \"Reconfigure\" button. If they click it, they see two text-fields with number of shards and number of replicas. The diff updates live as they change the values, and they have buttons labeled \"Cancel\" and \"Apply\". I don't think we should ever show a \"Reshard\" button."
