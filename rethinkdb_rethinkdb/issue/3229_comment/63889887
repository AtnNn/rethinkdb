      "@timmaxw Do you think the primary / secondary replicas should be presented more concisely (specifically without repeating the words \"primary replica: \"/\"secondary replicas:\" for each shard)? Or do you think that generally we shouldn't show the complete old and new configurations?\r\n\r\nRegarding diffs on resharding: Hmm, do you think the shards should be matched up based on their replicas? Or based on their (key) ordering? I'm not sure that sort of diff is going to be very meaningful, since it's somewhat arbitrary.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be opposed to making the `rebalance` functionality a separate button in the web UI.\r\nIf we do that: should we disable the `reshard` button unless a user has actually changed the number of shards (I think so)? Or repurpose it to a second rebalance button in that case? Or make it a no-op?\r\nWe could also switch the label of the existing button between `Rebalance` and `Reshard` (or `Reconfigure`) depending on whether the user has entered a number of shards that's different from the current configuration or not. That might be a bad idea from a UI standpoint though, I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nCurrently in `next`, we have only one button that says \"Rebalance\" next to the field where you enter the number of shards. If you press it without changing the number of shards, it effectively does a `rebalance()`, otherwise it does what's going to become a `reconfigure()`."
