      "I think we can do that kind of diff, but it strikes me as too clever. If the shards don't have a real identity, then we're incorrectly implying there is one.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n* Shard 1:\r\n  * replicas: A, B\r\n* Shard 2:\r\n  * replicas: B, C\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n* Shard 1:\r\n  * replicas: B, C\r\n* Shard 2:\r\n  * replicas: A, B\r\n* Shard 3:\r\n  * replicas: A, B\r\n\r\nDid we gain an identical shard or did they swap places? Do we just show shard one has having lost A and gained B? It's not that we couldn't answer these questions, it's that it won't be obvious to the user what's happening in the diff format (vs. replication changes that are straightforward additions and subtractions)"
