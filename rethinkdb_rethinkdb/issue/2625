        "I apologize if this isn't the appropriate place for feature requests. :smile:\n\nAs I've been playing around with the change feeds lately, I quickly realized how great it would be if I could feed the changes into an AMPQ (rabbit, for example) directly from RethinkDB.\n\nThis thought spawned from the inability to have multiple consumers on the same change feed (for failover reasons, if one daemon goes down, another should take over). This would provide better durability and I imagine more scalable.\n\nAt the very least, it would be nice to have the ability to round-robin the changes to multiple consumers for better parallelization (currently, all subscribers to the change feeds all get the same [duplicate] data).\n\nHope that makes sense. :smiley: \n\nKeep up the awesome work! :+1: \n"
