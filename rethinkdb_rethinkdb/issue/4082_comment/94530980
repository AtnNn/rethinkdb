      "Hey @neumino, thanks for replying here on behalf of Thinky ;) \r\n\r\nI'm aware of the fact it's trying to connect to the IPv6 address, but I'm supplying either 127.0.0.1 or localhost, so I'm not sure why it would try those addresses instead. How can I pass discovery false? Just in the options dictionary for the connection object? \r\n\r\nThank you very much. "
