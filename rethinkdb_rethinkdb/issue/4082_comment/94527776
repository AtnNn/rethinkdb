      "@freak4pc -- you can just pass `discovery: false` to thinky's option and it will work fine.\r\n\r\n`fe80:...` is a link local address, and will be picked only if no private  or public network is found -- though it seems that I forgot to check for `169.254.x.x` which is probably why the ipv6 ip is picked and not the ipv4.\r\nI'll probably switch the default flag for discovery to false as it seems to raise a few issues with containers and ipv6."
