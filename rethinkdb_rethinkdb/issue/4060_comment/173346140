      "@ramesh-pmap RethinkDB doesn't currently support connecting to your server directly from the browser-side code. You'll need to put the `r.connect` etc. in the backend code, that runs in node.js (and for that use port 28015, not 8080).\r\nThe RethinkDB API isn't suitable for direct connections from the browser, since it doesn't have a security model.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that we're working on a separate product that will allow exactly this type of use case. It's still in the planning phase, but we'll hopefully have a first alpha out very soon. (some details about it here: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3711#issuecomment-151639571)"
