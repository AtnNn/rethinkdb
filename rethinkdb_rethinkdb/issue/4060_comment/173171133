      "@ramesh-pmap: how are you starting RethinkDB? \r\n\r\nThe default port for the web UI is port 8080 (so you can access the admin UI via http://localhost:8080), and the default port for queries is 28015.\r\n\r\nThis means your connection code should start with `r.connect( {host: 'localhost', port: 28015, db: 'test'}, ...`.\r\n\r\nDoes that work for you?"
