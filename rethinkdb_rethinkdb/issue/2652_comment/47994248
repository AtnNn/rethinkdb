      "Another option besides std::unordered_map is simply a sorted vector of std::pairs (which is what boost::flat_map is).  I bet nothing we do right now would hurt for it (since operations copy the whole std::map anyway, but we might need to rewrite some code -- a blind conversion to boost::flat_map is out of question), and we'd have better performance than a std::map (because of locality and space efficiency)."
