      "I have fixed 2 and 3 in my branch `daniel_1820_fixes`.\r\n\r\nThere are still two problems left:\r\n1. Some issue with the master access throttling system, as @jdoliner noticed. This is probably the main cause for queries taking excessively long. Now working on this.\r\n2. One more long-running message that I haven't yet identified. it typically takes 0.5-1 seconds, which is very bad for low-latency applications."
