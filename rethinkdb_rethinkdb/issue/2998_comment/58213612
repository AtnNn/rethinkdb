      "@coffeemug I would think that the reverse is true: bubbling up the original error means that the user needs to track down in our code where the `socket.timeout` is occurring. By wrapping it we can make it very clear (in text) what is happening. Can you clarify how this is making the user\r\n\r\nIf we are going to use this logic then we should probably unwrap at least the \"Could not connect to HOST:PORT. Error: ERROR\" message, since that is similar. The rest of the RqlDriverError in `net.py` are mostly protocol errors (except for the \"connection closed\" ones)."
