      "This turns out to be because the test is hard-wired to use port 11221, and it just happens that someone had a RethinkDB server open with its http admin server on that port. So this brings up two things that need to be done:\r\n1. The test needs to find an open port and use that to test that we get the proper message in that case\r\n2. In the case that a port is open, but not the driver port of a RethinkDB server we probably should not be falling back to the `socket.timeout` error.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus should I make a new bug for the second issue, or would you like this one once I am done with the former?"
