      "Fixing this problem is easy: just wrap the while loop [on line 160 of net.py](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/39e6228df710788da26ff272e15ca41b59cdb261/drivers/python/rethinkdb/net.py#L161) with an `try`/`except socket.timeout` and raise a `RqlDriverError`. However, it seems that we have two tests that conflictingly demand that this be a `socket.timeout` error and a `RqlDriverError`.\r\n\r\nPersonally I am in favor of us wrapping this error with the text we put into the `RqlDriverError` (\"Timed out during handshake with HOST:PORT\"), but there was some discussion in another unresolved bug (#468) that seems to go counter to this.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug, you seemed to have solid opinions. Do you want to weigh in on this?"
