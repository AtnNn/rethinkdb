      "I think more programmers will dump data into a binary field than will be able to recognize a binary file by its first couple of bytes in hex. If the file can be identified by its first few bytes, arguably we should just do that for the user and display it nicely.\r\n\r\nAs far as say, storing a latin-9 text document in a binary to avoid re-encoding... I guess I don't know how often that kind of thing would happen. I feel like that dance would happen much less often than dumping a \"true\" binary file in. And even in that case, if you display the first few bytes you get `binary<'Ther'... >` or something. I don't think that's useful.\r\n\r\nI could see people dumping like MS Word files in, which internally use an encoding other than utf-8 but that's an easy to identify filetype. I don't think flat files encoded weird would be common."
