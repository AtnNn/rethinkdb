      "How often is any binary data going to be interesting raw? Even the first few bytes. This is speculation, but I'd guess there would be a lot of zip files, image files, etc, that no one will want to see anything like the base64/hex/binary representation for.\r\n\r\nI think we should do something like file explorers generally do:\r\n- if we recognize the file type, display it specially (like images), or at least give a custom icon\r\n- if we don't recognize it, just display a generic binary icon.\r\n\r\nI agree it should always be downloadable."
