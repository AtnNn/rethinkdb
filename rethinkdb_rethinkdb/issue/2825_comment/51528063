      "@Tryneus -- can you give me a formula to get the exact size of the binary? Or a link to the RFC you used?\r\nI can also just create a Buffer from the base64 string and get its size, but I would do it only for binaries that may be less than 1KB.\r\n\r\n\r\nI personally can't read a binary, and the reason I displayed the first characters of the base 64 string were mostly for aesthetic reason. It feels less \"opaque\" that way.\r\n\r\nI don't really care whether we display the first characters of the base 64 string, the first hex values, or the first ASCII characters. It just seem like bike-shedding to me.\r\nSince @timmaxw seems to have a strong preference for hex, I'll just go with that.\r\nNote that the raw view will still contain the base 64 string."
