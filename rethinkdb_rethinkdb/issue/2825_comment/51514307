      "The reason I suggest displaying the first bytes of the binary is for the sake of concreteness. It makes it feel like \"this is actually literally some binary data\" instead of an abstract object. I realize that this is subjective and some people might disagree.\r\n\r\nIf we're going to display the first bytes, then we might as well convert hexadecimal to ASCII when possible. It's useful in some situations, and there's no cost beyond the (fairly small) implementation cost.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I think we should display the first 10-20 bytes, not the first 4. So if someone dumps English text it will definitely be recognizable.\r\n\r\nDetecting and displaying file types might be a good idea, but it seems complicated. We'd have to have some sort of table of known file types, and keep it up to date, and decide what files to support, and so on. It's not impossible, but it's a lot more work than just decoding the first bytes."
