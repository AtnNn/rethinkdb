      "> How often is any binary data going to be interesting raw? Even the first few bytes. This is speculation, but I'd guess there would be a lot of zip files, image files, etc, that no one will want to see anything like the base64/hex/binary representation for.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the binary data will just be a text file or something that the user doesn't want to go through some Unicodification.  Also, the first few bytes usually recognizably identify the filetype."
