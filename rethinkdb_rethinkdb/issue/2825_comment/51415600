If a byte is a printable ASCII character, we should display that; otherwise, we should display a 2-character hex value.\r\n* We should also always give the user a download link.\r\n* If it seems like an image, we should let the user click a button (or link, or something) to see the image inline (or in a lightbox, or something)."
