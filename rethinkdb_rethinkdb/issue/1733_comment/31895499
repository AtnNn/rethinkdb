      "There is a hackish solution to this that I'm implementing for people interested in having this be a point release.  It's implemented and currently being tested right now, it should be in code review soon.  The hackish solution is to look at the terminal and transforms and sindex_function in `handle_pair` in rdb_protocol/btree.cc, and load the value specifically when we do a count query.\r\n\r\nThis is bad because it copies the logic in one place, but the hackishness will go away once we change the code to allow actually _processing_ the datums concurrently.  Right now we merely load them from disk concurrently."
