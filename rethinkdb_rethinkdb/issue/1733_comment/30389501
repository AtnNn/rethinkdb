      "I took a look at this.  I can confirm that there was a major slowdown in the speed of count (~5-10x).\r\n\r\n@srh -- Your changes to make btree reads happen in parallel (the `concurrent_traversal` stuff starting around Aug. 28) seem to be where the slowdown starts.  You add a line in e69c7fec829bf5a926831c9e24d52efbf3e30b5c which seems to make even `count` queries fetch things off disk, with an RSI to fix it, but then that RSI is removed in 1278dbdac8043d3c94224080adcb1ca943ff9093 without any noticeable fix being made.  When you get a chance, do you think you could speed this code back up?"
