      "as an aside - while document dbs are most applicable in cases where data is not relational at all and indexes are primarily for grabbing a document by some attribute other than the primary key, being able to operate on the indexes themselves (or combinations of multiple indexes) to acquire metadata (especially counts) would really help rethinkdb \"feel\" faster to data analysts and scientists using it. inserting, updating, reading or otherwise touching actual data can take time, but making any metadata you can very easy and fast to generate or access would be huge."
