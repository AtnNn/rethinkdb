      "The code actually already does what you're talking about. In your query no documents should be read off of disk and only the parts of the index which pertain to the given date should be processed. Indexes only get you so far in optimizing count though. To optimize this further we'd need to do #1118 which will allow for constant time `count`.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue though because as far as I can tell of the optimizations it suggests are already implemented. People should feel free to reopen if I'm wrong."
