      "I think the current proposal where you can rename nested fields is good.\r\n\r\nI think a `conflict` optarg is good, and that the default should be `error`.\r\n\r\nI think having `update` be a legal option is confusing, because I associate `update` with mutation more than merging.  I also think that being consistent with `insert` is desirable though.  How would people feel about changing `insert` so it read `insert(conflict: 'merge')` instead of `insert(conflict: 'update')`?  (I think `replace` and `error` are fine names.)\r\n\r\nI think `.rename` should be non-destructive, so you would write `r.table('posts').update{|row| row.rename(status: 'goodness')}` rather than `r.table('posts').rename(status: 'goodness')` as in the above post."
