      "Uww I like the idea of allowing a `function(key, value, row) -> newKey` argument.\r\nI'm less sure about the array syntax. That seems to be a bit outside the \"typical\" use case for `rename`?\r\n\r\nWe're formally past the ReQL proposal period for 2.3, so I suggest we settle this on the API from https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/881#issuecomment-164962569 for now.\r\n\r\nWe can pick the discussion up again if it doesn't make it into 2.3, or if we want to extend it later."
