      "Sorry for the feature creep, I'm a little late to the party on this one. I would find it really useful if you could specify an array as the \"new key\" and have it generate keys on the new object for each item. Example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.expr({ list_price: 500 }).rename({ list_price: [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] })\r\n// -> { \"a\": 500, \"b\": 500, \"c\": 500 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it might be pretty useful if `r.rename` accepted a function with the signature `(key, value, row)` so you could do things dynamically. I don't have an actual use-case for that one, but it seems like something you'd expect from ReQL."
