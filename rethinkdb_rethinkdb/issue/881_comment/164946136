      "@danielmewes I would maybe hesitate to use 'merge' for an operation that just overwrites old values, since in some other contexts, merge implies at least some sort of timestamp check or other intelligence behind which value to keep. I think in SQL merge can be used to do quite a few types of conflict resolution. I think that something like `insert(conflict: 'overwrite'|'keep'|'error')` might be more explicit? Sorry, I'm certainly not an expert."
