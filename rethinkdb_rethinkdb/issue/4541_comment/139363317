      "@dalanmiller Checked the log, no errors before that c++ internal compiler error. All looked fine, no memory error. \r\n\r\nDon't think I had anything running, except that the build was done in a screen:ed zsh. I had lowered the stacksize `ulimit -s 1024` to build go 1.5.1, so I guess that caused it. (The RPI B+ still has 8192).\r\n"
