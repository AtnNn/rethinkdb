      "@mogren Before the snippet in your most recent comment, can you scroll back and find if it said \"`virtual memory exhausted`\"? \r\n\r\nThat's also interesting that it took your Raspberry Pi 2 5.5 hours whereas mine took I think somewhere between 1 and 3? Do you have something else working on your RBPi2 that would slow it down? \r\n\r\n@danielmewes How hard would it be to generate a RethinkDB .deb built for ARM? So it'd be as easy as `apt-get install` on Rasbian? "
