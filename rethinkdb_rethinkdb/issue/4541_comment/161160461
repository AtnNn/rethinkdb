      "A fix for this is in CR 3378.\r\n\r\nThe fix simply disables the particular compiler warning in the affected files. The problem is that the comparison that the compiler complains about only makes sense for particular template instantiations, and evaluates to constant `true` for others. We could change the code to account for that rather than locally disabling the warning, but I think it's not worth the trouble."
