      "These warnings are really stupid by the way.\r\n\r\nThey are in lines that look like this:\r\n```\r\nif (sizeof(Ch) == 1 || unsigned(c) < 256)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Ch` is a template argument, and in this case it happens to be `char`. The comparison that the warnings talks about isn't even executed in that case, since the `sizeof(Ch)` will be `true` already.\r\n\r\nMaybe the fact that it complains on ARM but not on AMD64 is because `char` is unsigned on ARM?"
