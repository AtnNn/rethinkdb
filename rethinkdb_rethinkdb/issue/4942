        "This adds support for tracking the raft leader for each table and\r\ndisplaying that information per-table in the table_status\r\nartificial table.\r\n\r\nrelates to issue https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4902\r\n\r\nI know there probably is a lot to review here, as I'm clearly not very familiar with your code base. Off the top of my head I have the following comments/concerns:\r\n\r\n  * The serialized form of `table_status_response_t` has changed, making it incompatible with older versions of the database. I had considered packing this information into `table_raft_state_t` but wasn't sure if that would even make a difference, so it would be helpful if someone could advise here (I tacked it on to the end of the serialization in case order mattered here).\r\n\r\n  * The location of the data itself is just set as `raft_leader` on the top level of the `table_status` documents, this is easily changeable and I think it's just a matter of consensus on your side of where it belongs (`raft_leader` or `raft.leader` etc)\r\n\r\n  * Currently the raft_leader information piggybacks a request for `want_raft_state` which may be misleading, but let's me get away with not having to change the request format.\r\n\r\n  * The way I'm currently getting the server name seems a bit unorthodox, there are comments in your code describing its flakey nature in production\r\n\r\n  * In order to determine if a table is a raft leader I'm statically casting the `leader` member of a table manager, and before that process I use the leader rw locker. In other parts of the codebase where you something similar you allow for the possibility of it already being locked (sort of looks like a try_lock) due to leadership changes - this might be trouble if I don't do it here\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm sure there's more but it's a start."
