(Things should go through the code review process from now on -- feel free to make me a reviewer on these things).\r\n\r\nEDIT: in this case `useOutdated` on a table is undocumented, but there still may be bugs lurking underneath. (e.g. what happens when we pass `useOutdated` to `run` in both of the above examples? We should test for that)."
