        "It is currently pretty easy to find unsecure RethinkDB servers on Google / Bing etc. if they for some reason have got hold of the URL.\r\n\r\nWe could serve a robots.txt file to disable that kind of indexing.\r\nOptionally we could make the server generate a log message if robots.txt gets accessed. Something like \"It appears that your server has been accessed from the Internet. See http://rethinkdb.com/docs/security/ for information on how to secure it.\"\r\n\r\nOne argument against it is that it's an extremely incomplete protection. Specialized search engines like http://www.shodanhq.com/ (the one used in http://cispa.saarland/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MongoDB_documentation.pdf) likely won't care for a robots.txt."
