      "As to the spec, I think I would +1 ```json-patch``` over ```jsondiffpatch``` but can't say I'm too opinionated on it.\r\n\r\nFor the performance, I'll make a final quick plea and then shutup: it seems the whole point of adding the diff at the RethinkDB level is _for_ performance - it's about two lines of code to ```require('jsondiffpatch').diff``` and then ```diff(old_val, new_val)``` - extremely easy, but a waste of bandwidth and CPU. So if RethinkDB adds the same functionality without a bandwidth + CPU gain, it doesn't really end up helping, as the target use case is presumably people who have large objects and/or frequent changes in realtime constrained applications.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just my 2c, thanks!"
