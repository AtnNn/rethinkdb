      "Even if we compute a diff on the server for each change and don't take information from the write itself into account (the latter might be difficult), we could implement this in a way that saves a lot of CPU and bandwidth.\r\nFor example if there are a lot of changefeeds listening on the same table, we could perform the diffing only once on each RethinkDB server (or even just once on the primary). Then we would send the same diff to all subscribed clients.\r\n\r\nThis saves bandwidth, and is a lot more efficient than computing the diff individually for each client."
