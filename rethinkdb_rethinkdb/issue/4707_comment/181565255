      "I'll +1 this as well - mostly for performance/efficiency reasons. I'll stay out of the diff format side of it..\r\n\r\nGoing down the path of having fat documents for atomic update purposes, I quickly ran into the issue of needing document diffs. While diffing objects in the app can be a reasonable workaround for moderate sized documents, it's never going to be as fast as if we had knowledge of what parts of the document changed.\r\n\r\nAnd while you could go about building hierarchies of update counters into the document to help accelerate the diff code, there's still the overhead of parsing and transferring the whole document.
