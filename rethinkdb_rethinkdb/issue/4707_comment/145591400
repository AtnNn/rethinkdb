      "I was thinking json-patch myself. Something to consider though is the issue [Allow correlating writes with feed notifications](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4629). If something like jsondiffpatch were used then you could receive a single diff for each write to a document. With json-patch you'd potentially need several json-patch operations to express the change (although you could also have a wrapper that contained all of the json-patch operations)."
