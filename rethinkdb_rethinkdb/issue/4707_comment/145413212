      "@ember-max --there are two different aspects to this.\r\n\r\nThe first is the protocol to use to send the diff to the client. Since there is no standard way to specify JSON diffs, we can do it in a few ways -- use the spec defined by `jsondiffpatch`, define our own, find another existing one, etc.\r\n\r\nThe second aspect is how to implement it. We wouldn't have to do a full diff on two json documents because the database knows what the user is trying to do; we'd merely have to take that information and transform it into the user-facing diff protocol. The most naive way to do it is to diff two documents, and the first version of this feature may end up doing that to get it out faster, but sooner or later we'll be able to send efficient diffs back to the client without having to actually diff the documents."
