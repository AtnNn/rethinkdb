      "I'd like to +1 this (and #5188) \8211 whether RFC6902 is used or the more concise [Delta](https://github.com/benjamine/jsondiffpatch/blob/master/docs/deltas.md) format. It would make it very easy to apply changesets coming down to the browser via socket to a partial data store (\224 la Meteor DDP/Minimongo), and let something else (e.g. Mobservable) handle the reactivity based on that data store ... for those of us who can't or don't yet want to commit to the full Relay/GraphQL \"experience\"."
