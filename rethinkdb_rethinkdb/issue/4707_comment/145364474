      "After running some simple tests, the perf of (https://github.com/benjamine/jsondiffpatch) seems decent and is quite a bit better than at least one other alternative I came across (https://github.com/flitbit/diff). That said, it still represents actual blocking, CPU-chewing code (as opposed to IO), in the 5-15 millisecond range for large objects, so to the extent it could be moved off of application servers and into the rethinkdb processes (and ideally even optimized further using C++), it seems like that could be a big win without drastically altering the current changefeed implementation."
