      "@slava-vishnyakov -- Thanks!  (And thanks for providing so much info).\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell the core files don't match any of the symbols we have on launchpad.  I talked to @frank-trampe and he said that the very first versions we released on launch day didn't have associated symbol packages.  So there's really no good way forward on this unless it crops up again with a version that we have symbols for (i.e. anything not released on the first day)."
