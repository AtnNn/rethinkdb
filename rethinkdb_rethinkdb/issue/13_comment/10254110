      "@slava-vishnyakov -- we've seen the end-of-file bug before, but it was quite rare and we didn't pin it down. It's definitely a different issue, could you open a new one? (Also, thanks for reporting these, it's immensely helpful!)\r\n\r\nAs far as 200 writes per second -- see limitations in  https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/rethinkdb-next/NOTES -- currently we flush on every write with almost no batching, so we get really poor hdd write performance. This should be resolved in the coming release."
