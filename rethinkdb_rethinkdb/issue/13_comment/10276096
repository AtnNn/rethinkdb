      "@slava-vishnyakov -- Do you remember what version of RethinkDB you were running?  In particular, did you download it with apt-get or did you build it from source?  If the former, what ubuntu distro are you on, or if the latter, do you know the commit hash?\r\n\r\n(We had a small problem where we weren't properly generating the RethinkDB version string that we put in the binary, so we're having some trouble matching core dumps with symbol files.)\r\n\r\nThanks!"
