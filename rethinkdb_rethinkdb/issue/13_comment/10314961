      "@slava-vishnyakov -- thanks so much for the bug report. I'm going to close it as jammed because unfortunately we can't proceed on it unless it's reproduced on latest rethink version. It's totally our fault that the early build didn't have debugging symbols -- unfortunately we didn't line up all the pins for the release.\r\n\r\nWe're also working on #41 to make the report process much more smooth and streamlined."
