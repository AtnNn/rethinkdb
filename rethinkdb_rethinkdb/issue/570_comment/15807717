      "I detest the idea of having `has_attributes`, `has_names`, `has_keys` which is mostly the same as `has_fields` but with a subtly different meaning. I actually don't know what it is that leads programmers to think that using synonyms to express subtle differences in semantics is a good idea. It's terribly confusing."
