      "Most of this (`default`, `has_fields`, `with_fields`) is in internal code-review at the moment.  Changing the behavior of NULLs so that they throw on comparison probably isn't going to happen in the near future because there are too many things that depend on all RQL values having a well-defined ordering.\r\n\r\nThe 1.5 release is coming up very soon, so these changes probably won't make it into that, but there's a solid chance they'll be in for 1.6."
