      "Since `null` needs to respond to comparisons so that `orderBy` can work, I don't see why it should throw in other operations. Won't the need for pre-filtering result in worse performance?\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with unstructured data I want `null/undefined` errors to be silent 99% of the time. Mongo has special `$type` and `$exists` queries to cater for the special cases when you don't want that."
