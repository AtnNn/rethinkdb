If you want to create a github project for it with some basic instructions on how to use the file, we'll add it to the community contributions page (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/wiki/Community-contributions). Also, this page will soon get merged into main docs, so it'll get a lot more prominent.\r\n> ---\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n> https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/913#issuecomment-18598864"
