      "@seanhess -- I think we'd prefer not to include this for now because it increases the burden of maintenance and our driver people are already overworked. If you want to create a github project for it with some basic instructions on how to use the file, we'll add it to the community contributions page (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/wiki/Community-contributions). Also, this page will soon get merged into main docs, so it'll get a lot more prominent."
