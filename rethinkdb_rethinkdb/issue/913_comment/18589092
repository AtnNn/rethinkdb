      "I don't know much of anything about typescript though from what I can see here no modification of the actual source seems necessary. I can't possibly see what the node people would object to in an extra file being distributed with the package.\r\n\r\nIf we are going to distribute this file though we'll have to test and maintain it. I don't know how hard it will be to integrate such tests into our testing framework but it'll be work. If enough people find it useful though it might be worth it."
