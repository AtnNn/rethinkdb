      "Right I guess that's what I'm asking. Think if the typescript definition file as a formalization of the API. Is the definition even correct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\8203It would be fairly easy to integrate into your tests by changing an existing javascript test to be in typescript (just rename to .ts and use import syntax) then making sure it both passes and compiles.\160\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I don't really know. The typescript community doesn't have a great way to handle this right now. I think it would be cool if you guys provided the definition, since it would be correct, and since its in npm, it would match the driver version. I understand if you don't want to though.\r\n\r\nOn Tue, May 28, 2013 at 6:33 PM, wmrowan <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> I don't know much of anything about typescript though from what I can see here no modification of the actual source seems necessary.

I don't know how hard it will be to integrate such tests into our testing framework but it'll be work. If enough people find it useful though it might be worth it.\r\n> ---\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n> https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/913#issuecomment-18589092"
