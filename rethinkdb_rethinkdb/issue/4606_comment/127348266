      "As it happens we may have just fixed this on Friday with #4526. One of our tests had been showing an issue (only on my machine) and it looked like a timing issue where `close` would not finish. @deontologician isolated it and fixed it, and it sounds very like what you are describing.\r\n\r\nWould you mind trying out the JavaScript driver from our latest version? I can send you it in email if you can't/don't want to build it yourself (@thejsj has your email address)."
