        "Currently, Ruby client implements r.js command in the following way:\n\n``` ruby\ntable.map{r.js(\"this.id\")} # by default, accepts an expression\ntable.map{r.js(\"return this.id;\", :func)} # with :func, accepts a full function body\n```\n\nThis is the way we want to do it. Currently Python and JS clients only accept the function body. The api docs on rethinkdb.com currently say that _all_ clients only accept an expression. We need to do the following:\n1. Change javascript and python implementations of js to work like the ruby implementation (an expression by default, function body if the user passes a second optional argument)\n2. Fix the API docs to document this properly\n\n@wmrowan -- could you fix the clients and tests, and then coordinate with @al3xandru to fix the docs?\n"
