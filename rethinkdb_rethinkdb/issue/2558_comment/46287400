      "Hi @timjrobinson. You can only call the `update` command on a table because `update` mutates the data and persists it to disk, which isn't possible with `r.expr`. If you'd like to modify `r.expr` data you can use the `merge` command that will merge the data in and return a new copy.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!"
