      "RethinkDB doesn't currently have a way to store queries in tables.  We're thinking of adding persistent changefeeds in the future (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3471), which would be similar in some ways to what you want.\r\n\r\nClosing since this isn't a bug, but feel free to continue asking questions here."
