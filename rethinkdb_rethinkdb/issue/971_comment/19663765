      "> Or just support swapping arrays out to disk...\r\n\r\nI actually think not doing this is a feature, not a bug. If we implement swapping arrays out to disk we'll make the implementation significantly more complex, but also train users to create large arrays that, instead of failing when they get too big, become progressively slower and less scalable over time. That's not what arrays are for, so I think setting a hard limit on array size is a better option all around (less work and more user-friendly in the long term)."
