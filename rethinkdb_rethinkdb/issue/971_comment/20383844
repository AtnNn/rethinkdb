      "Only to some degree.\r\nHaving a (configurable) limit has the advabtage of bounding memory utilization. If arrays get too large, the user would receive an error message instead of the server crashing due to failing allocations or the OOM killer terminating it.\r\n\r\nIf the decision is between a static and no limit, I would be in favor of no limit though.\r\n\r\nThe other thing which makes the limit on array sizes a bit unsatisfying IMO is the fact that it doesn't actually stop queries from exceeding available memory. There are still loads of other ways to make that happen. A configurable per-query memory limit of course would be absolutely awesome!\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: srh <notifications@github.com>\r\nDate: Tue, 02 Jul 2013 15:18:33 \r\nTo: rethinkdb/rethinkdb<rethinkdb@noreply.github.com>\r\nReply-To: rethinkdb/rethinkdb <reply@reply.github.com>\r\nCc: Daniel Mewes<danielmewes@onlinehome.de>\r\nSubject: Re: [rethinkdb] Re-instate a sane array size limit (#971)\r\n\r\nThose are also justifications for having no limit.\r\n\r\n---\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/971#issuecomment-20383011\r\n\r\n"
