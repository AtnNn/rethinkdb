      "Don't let my comment stand in your way of doing the simple thing, but I think limiting the array size to N elements isn't very useful considering the incredibly large range of document sizes we've seen so far (from a few bytes to megabytes). I think we should put in the time and limit the array size by memory footprint -- it would be immensely more useful."
