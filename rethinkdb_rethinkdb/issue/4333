        "While talking to a GIS developer yesterday during my talk, he mentioned that one of the two features he'd like to see in RethinkDB in order to make it suitable for GIS work were 1. multi-geometries (MultiPolygons, MultiLines, etc.) and 2. Centroids (getting the center of a polygon or a geometry). \n\nEven though you can still add an array of polygons (for example), multi-polygons make getting data back and forth between other systems that have broader GeoJSON support easier (ArcGIS, MongoDB, etc.). \n\nCentroid came up as the other geospatial feature that seemed essential for GIS work. \n"
