      "Although curiously if I attempt to replicate a table to one of the slaves I get:\r\n```\r\nThe server returned the following error: The server(s) hosting table `test.table` are currently unreachable. The table's configuration was not changed.\r\n```\r\nThe primary where the data is located is up and has the table, it sees the slaves, so do the slaves as I can browse the table data from them. I also see the log updating with entries from the primary."
