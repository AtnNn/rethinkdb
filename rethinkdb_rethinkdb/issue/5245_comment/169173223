      "In my case, a missing voting replica was missing before new shards were added. So no new election would take place. An emergency repair to remove the missing node resolved my situation.\r\n\r\nI recommend advising in documentation that only 2 nodes should never run in a cluster. Either one, or at least 3.  Running 2 can get stuck like what happened to me."
