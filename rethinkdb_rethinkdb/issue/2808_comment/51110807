      "A small problem with the server returning an error is if the query was sent with `noreply=true`. We can't parse the query to obtain that opt arg, because that would defeat the whole purpose of the size limit.\r\nWe could ignore that and just send back a response anyway, which would work in the more common case of `noreply=false`.\r\n\r\nChecking on the client avoids such issues."
