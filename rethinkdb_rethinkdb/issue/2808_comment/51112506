      "> if a query is sent with `noreply=false`, we can just ignore the error.\r\n\r\nIgnore it where? You mean on the client? The server wouldn't know whether the client sent `noreply=false` or not.\r\n\r\nThe solution to \"Sending back an error when the client sent `noreply=false` would break\" is to still close the connection after sending the error message. So if\r\na) the client doesn't catch the too large query\r\nb) and `noreply=false` was specified\r\nwe would fall back to a more or less cryptic error message  that the connection was terminated, but at least wouldn't leave the connection in an undefined state."
