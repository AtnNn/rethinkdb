      "The connections with the node.js driver are \"event\" safe.\r\n\r\nYou can fire `query1` then `query2` without waiting `query1` to return.\r\nYou won't receive the results for `query2` before the results for `query1` though.\r\n\r\nSo while it works, you probably don't want to use a single connection but one connection per query (opening one connection per query, or re-using connections with a pool)."
