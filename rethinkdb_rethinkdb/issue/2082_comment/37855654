      "@matanster -- thanks for chiming in with more general feedback, it helps prioritize things a lot. Would you mind taking a few minutes to write down which parts of RethinkDB still feel like rough edges? It would help immensely. Feel free to email your feedback to me (slava@rethinkdb.com) if it's too rough for github issues."
