      "I also vote to get rid of the code, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* I don't think a walkthrough is a bad idea per se, a really nice UI + a simple introductory walkthrough can still be really nice. But I do think that to maintain the level of polish we have now, we'd have to do a well thought-out interactive mini-tutorial, not a slideshow, and the code we have now is useless for that.\r\n* Considering how much people like the UI, and all the other stuff we'd like to do, it's unlikely this project will get done any time soon. So the code will bitrot even further.\r\n* It's frankly not very difficult to put back in if we ever need it."
