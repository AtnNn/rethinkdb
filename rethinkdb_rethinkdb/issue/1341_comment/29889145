      "I have this error on a cluster of four servers, when I try to query using the web interface.\r\n`RqlClientError: This HTTP connection not open.`\r\n\r\nAlso I spotted the `Connected to` section in the top left shows different server names in every few seconds (about 5 seconds). Is that means the web interface can't connect to the database server?"
