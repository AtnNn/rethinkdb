      "@speier How do you connect to the web ui? Do you forward packer through a ssh tunnel or redirect them with apache/nginx?\r\n\r\nThe value displayed in `connected to` should never change. If it changes, it means that you are connecting to another server, and right now, there is no code in the web ui that lets you do that.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you were somehow forwarding traffic to different machines, that would explain the `HTTP connection not open errror`.\r\n"
