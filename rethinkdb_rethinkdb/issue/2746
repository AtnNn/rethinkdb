        "Maintaining fully supported drivers is a lot of work, but it would probably be significantly easier to autogenerate the boilerplate AST data types and JSON serialization code for many more languages. These could act as a head start for any community driver authors, and make it easier for them to keep up to date with ReQL.\r\n\r\nThere are probably lots of ways to do this. Looking at the [protobufs declaration](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/v1.13.x/src/rdb_protocol/ql2.proto), it doesn't look like arguments and optargs per function are specified there, so it may require some other more descriptive document.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think the maintenance of some master language spec + a simple template file per language would be manageable.\r\n"
