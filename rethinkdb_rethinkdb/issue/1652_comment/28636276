      "Hello @wojons \r\n\r\nThe only reads that are reported right now are point read (with `.get()`). There is an issue about that (#660).\r\n\r\nSorry you ran into this. We mostly work on performance now (to ship a LTS release), and this issue has not been scheduled yet. @coffeemug may be able to tell you more about when we may fix it.\r\n\r\nClosing as duplicate of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/660"
