      "This was brought up in the Q&A after the 1.16 webinar around 23:02 [(YouTube link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBqVjT2xz_8#t=23m2s) and it sounded like the justification for not simply returning the entire result set on every change was to reduce network overhead. I can appreciate why this behavior is desirable but I think for a lot of cases the simplicity of receiving the entire result set every time is worth it for simplicity.\r\n\r\nSo maybe we could have a `return_vals` or `include_all` optarg."
