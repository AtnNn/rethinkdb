      "I do understand that the absence of the `old_val` key indicates that a particular row is part of the initial batch; however, this is not sufficient in telling us which row represents the _final_ one of the initial batch.\r\n\r\nConsider the example above. In the case where the `scores` table contains less than 10 rows to begin with, we are unable to determine the end of the initial batch on the client."
