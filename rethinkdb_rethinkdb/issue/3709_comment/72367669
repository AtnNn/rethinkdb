      "The only issue I see with the `{note: \"last_initial_val\"}` solution is that it requires the database to know, when publishing a particular row, whether that row is the final one. I can imagine scenarios in which this may not be a desirable property.\r\n\r\nOne solution that doesn't have this problem is simple adding a `{ready: true}` message to the protocol, but extending the protocol to support this may break backwards compatibility."
