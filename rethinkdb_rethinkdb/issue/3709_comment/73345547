      "> I think we should preserve ordering on a per-primary-key basis. \r\n> ... you'd always have a document to apply it to right away\r\n\r\nThat doesn't sound too bad.\r\n\r\nYou'd know better than I would if that implies troubling performance down the road, as your proposal would require remembering the set of primary keys already sent. I'm envisioning a troublesome query like `r.table('a').orderBy('z').changes()`, where `z` is not the primary key. (Whether or not that query could be expected to work well in the first place is left as an exercise for the reader.)"
