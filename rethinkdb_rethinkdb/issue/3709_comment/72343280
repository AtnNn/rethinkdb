      "In general, with the scope of queries that can be watched for changes expanding, it would be nice to have a way to clearly distinguish between:\r\n\r\n1. The results of the query as though I had not appended `.changes()`\r\n1. Any changes / deltas following that result set.\r\n\r\nFrom the [current documentation](http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/python/changes):\r\n\r\n> The first notification object in the changefeed stream will contain the query's initial value in `new_val` and have no `old_val` field. \r\n\r\nThis sounds a little ambiguous in the case of multiple initial documents, but it sounds like one can unambiguously distinguish **any query's** initial results from its change events by waiting for the first response with an `old_val` key.\r\n\r\nIf so, then adding a `note` key makes sense as we won't have to block on the first change to make that distinction. This conversation is strongly related to the `return_initial` proposal in #3579."
