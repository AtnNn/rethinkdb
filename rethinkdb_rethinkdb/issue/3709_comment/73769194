      "@neumino \r\n> Could we have a note to distinguish this feed from other feeds?\r\n\r\nYou mean a feed that has `include_states` enabled? That's a good idea, I think we should do that through our `ResponseHints` interface (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3715).\r\n\r\n> Shouldn't it be more something like `initial_values: true` (or something better)?\r\n\r\nThat seems like a much worse description of what `include_states` does to me. I mean you can get the initial values without `include_states`.\r\n\r\n> If someone insert `{id: 4}` before `ready` is sent, will I get `{new_val: {id: 4}}` then `{new_val: {id: 4}, old_val: null}`?  Or can I get straight `{new_val: {id: 4}, old_val: null}`? Or just `{new_val: {id: 4}}`?\r\n\r\nI think you would either get only `{new_val: {id: 4}, old_val: null}` or only `{new_val: {id: 4}}`, but not both."
