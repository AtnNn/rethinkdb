      "* We add an optarg `note_states` to `changes`.  It defaults to `false` but can be set to `true` on any changefeed.\r\n* If `note_states` is `true`, we will occasionally insert documents of the form `{state: X}` into the stream of changes.\r\n* One value for `X` will be `initializing`.  We'll send `{state: 'initializing'}` as the first document of a feed which returns initial values.\r\n* Another value for `X` will be `ready`.  We'll send `{state: 'ready'}` whenever we're done sending initial values.  (So for a changefeed which doesn't return initial values, `{state: 'ready'}` will be the first document.)\r\n* We reserve the right to add more states in the future.\r\n* We reserve the write to send changes before `{state: 'ready'}`, even though we don't do so right now, but if we do so then we'll guarantee that the initial value for a particular primary key is always seen before any changes to that primary key."
