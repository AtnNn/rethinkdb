      "I think we should preserve ordering on a per-primary-key basis.  So you can get `[{new_val: {id: 0}}, {old_val: {id: 0}, new_val: {id: 0, a: 1}}, {new_val: {id: 1}}, {state: 'ready'}]`, but you could never get `[{new_val: {id: 1}}, {old_val: {id: 0}, new_val: {id: 0, a: 1}}, {new_val: {id: 0}}, {state: 'ready'}]`.  So when you get a change, you'd always have a document to apply it to right away rather than having to keep it around in a separate queue."
