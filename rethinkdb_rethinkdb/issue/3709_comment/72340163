      "Looking at the javascript driver, it seems like the `EventEmitter` interface could be useful - there could be a `loaded` event which indicates the end of the initial batch. Not sure how this would be implemented in the other drivers though.\r\n\r\nAnother option I see is simply adding a field to the rows returned from the changefeed (in addition to `new_val`/`old_val`). Perhaps an integer `remaining` field or simply a boolean `lastOfBatch` field.\r\n\r\nSomething like the \"remaining\" concept could possibly be implemented on the cursor level instead as well."
