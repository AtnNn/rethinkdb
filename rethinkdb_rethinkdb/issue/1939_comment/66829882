      "Interesting. I think there's something odd going on in our unit tests.\r\nWe've had at least one other case (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2198) where a unit test failure was depending on which other unit tests had been run before and in which order they were run.\r\n\r\nI'm going to move this out of test into 1.16-polish (though I expect it will be pushed over to the next release), since it's not necessarily a bug in the testing framework itself."
