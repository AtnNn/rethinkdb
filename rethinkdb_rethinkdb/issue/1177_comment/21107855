      "Ok, this is definitely a memory issue. Unfortunately we can't give a better error message because the kernel's OOM killer doesn't give the process an option to catch the signal before the kernel kills the process.\r\n\r\nOne thing you could do is to set the `cache_size` option to `table_create` to 256MB (it's 1GB by default). This would let you stretch the existing RAM for longer. (RethinkDB will automatically scale down the cache size with the available memory as of the 1.9 release). However, Rethink really isn't meant to be run with less than 1GB of memory (if you can get 2GB, it's even better). Once you get to larger datasets, you need a some minimum amount of memory for Rethink to keep working, and 512MB is unfortunately too low.\r\n\r\nI'll close this issue (since relevant cache fixes are already tracked elsewhere), but please feel free to comment here if you have more questions."
