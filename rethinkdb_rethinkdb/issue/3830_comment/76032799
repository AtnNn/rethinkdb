      "@alimoeeny -- getting back `null` is normal; the server sends back `null` whenever you do a point get for a key that doesn't exist.  If you start up a fresh RethinkDB server, create a table, go to the web UI, and write `r.table('test').get(0)`, you should get back `null`.\r\n\r\nAs for why you can't retrieve your original object -- what did it look like when you inserted it?  If you just write `r.table('whatever')` and read everything from the stream, does it show up?"
