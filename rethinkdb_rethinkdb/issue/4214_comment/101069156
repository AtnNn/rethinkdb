      "Hi @Slava , thanks for opening an issue.\r\nI can reproduce this and I think it's because the `changes` type signature in our API documentation is too strict. I'll open a new issue in the docs repository. Once we've fixed the type signature, it should work in the upcoming RethinkDB 2.1 in the Data Explorer as well."
