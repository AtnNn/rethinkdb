      "Our cursor class inherits from Enumerable, which doesn't implement `next`, but you can turn it into an Enumerator by calling either `cursor.to_enum` or `cursor.each` (with no arguments), and that should support `next`.  I talked about this with @larkost, and I wouldn't be opposed to making cursors support `next` by default either by returning an enumerator or implementing it ourselves."
