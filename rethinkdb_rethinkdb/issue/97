        "We can't have the OOM killer wreaking havoc on our users' processes willy-nilly.  We need to have a smarter cache memory manager that limits the total cache size per machine to some reasonable number, and allows stealing cache memory between tables. We can discuss the details when we get to this feature.\n\nAdditionally, we need to do memory profiling on large queries -- it seems that memory usage is higher than it should be.\n"
