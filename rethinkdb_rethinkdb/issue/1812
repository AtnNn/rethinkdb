        "Currently we allow turning on multi-datacenter replication, _and_ cluster-wide replication settings at the same time. This is fairly confusing -- it's not clear how the two settings interact.\n\nBy means of example. Suppose I have 2 cluster-wide replicas, 2 replicas in DC A, 2 replicas in DC B. I also have two machines in DC A, two machines in DC B, and two machines unassigned to datacenters. What do cluster-wide replicas mean? Does it mean they'll only be assigned to unassigned machines? (the answer is no) If not, is this in addition to per-datacenter replicas or not? (the answer is in addition)\n\nWhen I tried to figure this out (after having forgotten about it) it was fairly confusing to me, and is surely confusing to new users.\n\nThere are a couple of options I can think of:\n- Only allow cluster-wide replication settings or per-datacenter replication settings, but not both.\n- Provide a better textual description in the WebUI/docs/etc. as to what cluster-wide replication settings do in presence of datacenter replication settings.\n"
