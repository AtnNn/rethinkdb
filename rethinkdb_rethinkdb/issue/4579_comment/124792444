      "> it would be nice to include both the opening and closing parentheses when auto-filling, but put the cursor between them.\r\n\r\nPretty sure this already works if you have \"*Auto-insert pair ...*\" enabled under data explorer settings. I definitely think that should be enabled by default, though.\r\n\r\nAnother nice one to have would be completions for indexed operations. So if I `<tab>` to complete `.group()` and then `<tab>` again the next completion would be `.group({ index: '' })` with my cursor in between the quotes. Would be even better if it were context-aware enough to only do that when it makes sense."
