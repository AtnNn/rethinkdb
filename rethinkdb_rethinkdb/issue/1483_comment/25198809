      "When we drop a connection from a node of the wrong version, we log a warning.  Example from the unit test that tests this behavior:\r\n```\r\nwarn: Connection attempt with a RethinkDB node of the wrong version, local version: 1.9.0-450-g40666b, remote version: 0.1.1b, connection dropped\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs the visibility for this too low?"
