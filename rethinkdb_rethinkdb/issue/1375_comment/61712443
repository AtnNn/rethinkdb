      "@coffeemug Sorry, I assumed this was the plan, but I saw now that we hadn't actually reached a consensus on the question.\r\n\r\nThe statements I could find in this thread are that @mlucy was \"agnostic\" to that question and @gchpaco said \"[...] I think that if we add query limits [...] we don't really need array limits or datum limits.\"\r\nDo you think there's a reason to keep the array size limit around?\r\nDoes it solve a problem that the memory size limit doesn't?"
