      "There are three different things here:\r\n* The array size limit.\r\n* A per-query memory limit.\r\n* A cumulative array/object size limit.\r\n\r\nWe currently only have the array size limit.  I think we need *either* an array size limit or a cumulative array/object size limit (Slava thinks that if we only had a per-query memory limit it would feel developer-unfriendly).  I think we need *either* a per-query memory limit or a cumulative array/object size limit to do #2721, which is important.  Long-term, I think we need a per-query memory limit for devops reasons.\r\n\r\nSo, I think short-term we should implement a cumulative array/object size limit so that we can do #2721, and long-term we should add a per-query memory limit in addition to the cumulative array/object size limit.  I'm agnostic on whether we should get rid of the existing array size limit when we implement the cumulative array/object size limit."
