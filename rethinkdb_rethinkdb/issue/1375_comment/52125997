      "I would be OK with just having a per-{object/array} cumulative size limit and doing a generic memory-limiting system later.  I think it depends on how hard it would be to limit memory on a per-query basis.\r\n\r\n(To be clear, when I say \"cumulative size limit\" I mean \"An array of ten objects each with 5 fields counts as 50.\")\r\n\r\n@gchpaco -- any opinion?"
