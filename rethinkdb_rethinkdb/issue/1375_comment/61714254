      "> Does it solve a problem that the memory size limit doesn't?\r\n\r\nThat's a good point -- I'm not sure. To me these arguments solve slightly different problems. The array limit lets me design an app in a way where I can have very well-defined and consistent assurances about when things will and will not work. So if I start getting into large array territory, I can temporarily increase the limit and redesign my app.\r\n\r\nThe memory limit is more of an operational thing. I might set it to different values on different machines for my analytics-type queries, for example, but because I can't easily map in my mind from the memory limit to the possible number of elements in the array, just having it would be very unpredictable for the use case above.\r\n\r\nI think we should keep both for now, see what happens in real usecases as people start taking advantage of this functionality, and then decide whether we want to merge the two optargs later."
