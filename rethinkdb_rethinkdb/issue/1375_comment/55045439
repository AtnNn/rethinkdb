      "If we introduce such limit, are we adding an option in the query language to increase it?\r\nIt would be a poor experience to be stuck during a one time analytic operation because of this limit.\r\n\r\nAlso is there a reason we ship this in 1.16? It seems to be purely for safety -- and no one really ran into that right?\r\nI would rather fix things that people run into like backtraces, compound indexes, and strings operations for example."
