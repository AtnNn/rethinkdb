      "In theory, this could be done with the preexisting configurable limits spec, and by adding an allocator to the `env` parameter.  That allocator would then need to be threaded into every allocation made; this probably means *at least* feeding it to the datum builders, which isn't that big a problem.\r\n\r\nIt would be highly obnoxious and difficult to try to force the total allocated memory of the query across all shards to fit some threshold; much easier to enforce it on a per shard basis.  I can look into this if you want me to."
