      "What I expect to happen if someone runs a query without index is:\r\n\r\n- User runs `r.table(\"foo\").orderBy(\"id\").run()` -- hits the array limit\r\n- User runs `r.table(\"foo\").orderBy(\"id\").run({arrayLimit: Infinity})` -- hit the memory limit\r\n- User runs `r.table(\"foo\").orderBy(\"id\").run({arrayLimit: Infinity, memoryLimit: Infinity})` -- OOM killed\r\n\r\nThe limits don't solve anything, and just prevent them from shooting themselves in the foot.\r\n\r\nTo me, this is still a not low hanging fruit that isn't tasty and doesn't fill much.\r\nHaving the drivers automatically coerce cursors to arrays would solve more problem that this limit -- at least people won't run things like `r.table(\"foo\").coerceTo(\"ARRAY\")`."
