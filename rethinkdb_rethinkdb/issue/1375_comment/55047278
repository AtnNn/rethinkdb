      "It would be configurable the same way the array size limit is now.\r\n\r\nI want to do this sooner rather than later because I think we need this for https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2721.  (If we don't have this, then it's way too easy for someone with large rows in a table to accidentally try to load the whole table into memory.  For instance, if someone had 1-MB rows and wrote `r([r.table('test'), r.table('test2')])`, the array size limit wouldn't kick in until we'd loaded 100GB into memory.)"
