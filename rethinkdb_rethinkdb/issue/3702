      Just
        "Currently, `cursor.each` has the following signature:\n\n``` js\ncursor.each(function(err, row) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  processRow(row);\n});\n```\n\nI've encountered situations where `processRow(row)` had to run asynchronously in series, but I don't think it's possible to do that with `cursor.each()` if I'm not mistaken. Correct me if I'm wrong.\nI could do what I wanted with `cursor.next()` as follows:\n\n``` js\nvar fetchRow = function fetchRow(err, row) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  asyncFunc(function (err, result) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    cursor.next(fetchRow);\n  });\n};\ncursor.next(fetchRow);\n```\n\nHowever, the above feels cumbersome and I'd like if `cursor.each` accepts `done` parameter so I can do something like this:\n\n``` js\ncursor.each(function (err, row, done) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  asyncFunc(done);\n});\n```\n\nSo if `done` parameter is provided, it runs asynchronously and otherwise, it runs synchronously. Similar to how [Mocha is doing](http://mochajs.org/#asynchronous-code).\n"
