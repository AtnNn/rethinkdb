      "@AtnNn I ran the basic test of creating a table, inserting a few documents, and creating an index. The resulting file worked with 1.13.1 and v1.13.x.\r\n\r\nNone of the changes in #2563 should actually change any serialization format. The actual serialization functions were not changed, just handling for versions other than the one used in v1.13.0 to v1.13.1 was added.\r\n\r\nIt's a large amount of code changes (many just of the type \"search & replace\"), but there are few changes in what the code actually does.\r\n\r\nThe risk of involuntarily having changed some serialization format in a way that wouldn't be caught by creating a table with one version and successfully reading it with the other one is very small."
