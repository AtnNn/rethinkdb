      "Having thought about this, I'd like to kill this proposal for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- It's unclear how to implement it effectively (or whether an effective implementation is possible).\r\n- If we found an effective implementation, the benefits/value proposition seem marginal relative to the amount of work we'd have to do.\r\n- This would be a departure from the current architecture, and would block other important issues (like #2169) until it's done (or at least specced out). I don't think that's worth doing.\r\n- There are much more important clustering issues to take care of, and I think we should concentrate on those.\r\n\r\nI'll give everyone a few days before closing in case there are additional comments I haven't considered, but I've made up my mind unless there is new information I'm not aware of."
