      "Thanks @neumino -- nice writeup.\r\n\r\nWe've been talking about clustering primitives on Thu night and had a lot of lower-level ideas that are more fundamental than some of the things you're describing here. I'm going to open a separate issue for those (with another proposal) -- I think we should discuss that first. Once we settle on the more basic stuff, perhaps we should reconsider this proposal again (depending on where we end up with the basic primitives)."
