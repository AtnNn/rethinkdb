      "I think clusters where people need up-to-date reads to be served by multiple machines are probably sufficiently rare, and run by sufficiently competent people, that we could get away with requiring manual configuration for this.  Maybe they can specify specific machines that need to ack all writes, and then up-to-date read queries can be routed to any of those machines?\r\n\r\n(Also, note that some of the changefeeds code may need to change once up-to-date read queries are no longer always routed to the same set of machines.)"
