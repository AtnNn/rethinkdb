      "On further thought, my proposed solution only works for slow machines, and doesn't help for machines that have failed completely. It's true that the primary could detect when it loses the connection to a secondary, but it would have to notify every single client that the secondary was no longer up to date and wait for a response before it could safely continue accepting writes. In fact, if there's a netsplit, I think that would be impossible and we would have to stop accepting writes completely in order to preserve the guarantee that every accepted write is visible to every up-to-date reader."
