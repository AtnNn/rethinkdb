      "Here's a compromise: When a client wants to send an up-to-date read to a secondary, it also pings the master in parallel to confirm that the secondary is still up to date. Because the ping happens in parallel, the latency is still only 2 network hops. (However, one of those hops is to the master, which might be expensive if the master is in another data center.) The cost for the master to respond to ping is probably much less than the cost of responding to a read query. So it reduces the CPU load on the master at the cost of increasing the total CPU load across the entire cluster."
