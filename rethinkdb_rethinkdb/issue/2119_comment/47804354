      "Here's a proposal: Every secondary monitors its own performance and estimates whether it is \"fast\" or \"slow\". If it is \"fast\", then it asks the primary to wait for its acks before replying to the client, and it also puts out a notification saying that it is willing to accept up-to-date reads. If it is \"slow\", then it stops accepting up-to-date reads and tells the primary not to wait for its acks before replying to the client. It periodically re-estimates if it is \"fast\" or \"slow\" and changes its behavior accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe proposed auto-switching behavior is dangerous. In particular, it's possible that the secondary will be fast, so it will accept up-to-date reads, and the extra workload will make it slow, so it will stop accepting them, and the cycle will repeat. But maybe we can find a way to make it safe."
