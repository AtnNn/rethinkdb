      "Michel suggested that we use timeouts. If the secondary stops accepting up-to-date reads one second after the connection drops, and the master stops requiring acks from the secondary two seconds after the connection drops, then in theory everything should be OK. We should think about whether it's safe to rely on timeouts."
