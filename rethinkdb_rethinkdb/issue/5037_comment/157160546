      "> For the moment I would rather see the errors. I think that having `known_failures` right there makes things obvious enough.\r\n\r\nI think that's a bad idea because it makes it harder to interpret the test output. We should aim for 100% passing tests at each release as much as possible.\r\nWouldn't it make more sense to put it on some list or have an issue about it and removing it from the running tests until we find time to address it?"
