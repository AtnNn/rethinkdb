      "> +1 for having the standard be that the tests in `next` always pass when you run them.\r\n\r\nThat's harder to do, but I think at least we shouldn't have tests that we know aren't right reported as failures. In the absence of a feature for distinguishing those from proper failures in the testing system, I think we should disable them instead, or have them run only on demand (so that @larkost can run the tests to make sure they don't break more than they already do, but when you just run `./run`, the output reflects the set of actual bugs)."
