      "As a reference, you could take a look here:\r\n\r\nThe current mysql instrumentation looks this:\r\nhttps://github.com/RisingStack/trace-nodejs/blob/master/lib/instrumentations/mysql.js#L49 - as we don't have access to the prototype, we had to it this way, and overwrite the connection factory. Currently, we would do something similar here as well.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand: https://github.com/RisingStack/trace-nodejs/blob/master/lib/instrumentations/mongodb.js - as mongodb exposes the prototype as well, it is really just wrapping that method, without have to modify the factory itself"
