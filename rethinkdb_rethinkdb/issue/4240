        "So if you fix #4239, you can end up with `RqlDriverError: This shouldn't happen`\n\nThis is a sneaky bug. You can reproduce it by opening a point change feed on an existing document, call `feed.next` and delete the document at the same time. As soon as `feed.next` is resolved, call `feed.close` \n\nWhat can happen is the following:\n- Open the feed (get a partial response with the initial value)\n- `feed.next` is resolved with the initial change\n- Send the delete query\n- Send the continue query for the changefeed\n- Close the feed (`@_closeCb` is now defined)\n- Get back the delete change with a `SUCCESS_PARTIAL`\n- Reach error `This shouldn't happen`\n\nBasically, having `_closeCb` defined doesn't mean that getting a `SUCCESS_PARTIAL` is impossible.\nIt fails about once out of 200 times for me on my desktop.\n"
