      "> first_batch_downsizing_factor would be a slightly better name, though it's still pretty long.\r\n\r\nThat has negative associations I think we should avoid.\r\n\r\nWhy is it a factor and not simply `first_batch_size`?  I don't mean to nitpick an obscure API that'll disappear if we ever do batching appropriately, but (I can't help myself) -- increasing the batch size doesn't immediately suggest that you'd want to increase the first batch proportionately.  As a *general* rule that's true 70% of the time, it's not great to have API options representing proportions of one another."
