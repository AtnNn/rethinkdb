      "I think we should just have the `scaledown` config.  Supporting different `first_batch_...` optargs would require an actual functionality change; I'd rather just expose what we're currently doing in a sane way.  (Also, I think a scaledown factor is a very reasonable concept if we document it properly.)\r\n\r\nHere's what I would do:\r\n* max_batch_bytes\r\n* max_batch_rows\r\n* max_batch_seconds (this takes a `double` and we turn it into microseconds internally)\r\n* first_batch_scaledown_factor\r\n\r\nI don't care all that strongly, though, so if other people really dislike the scaledown factor I'd be OK changing it."
