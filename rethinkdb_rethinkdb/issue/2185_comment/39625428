      "I don't think we should scale it down by a hardcoded factor. I think we should just specify defaults for all these values. If the user changes some options, I'd leave the corresponding `first_batch` options as is. I don't think it would hurt anybody, it's easy to understand and transparent, and it's easy to change if you don't like the values."
