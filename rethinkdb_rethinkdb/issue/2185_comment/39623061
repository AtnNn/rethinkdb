      "@coffeemug It's not a lot of work.\r\n\r\nThe question remains what we do if somebody specifies some of the options, but not the corresponding `first_batch_*` ones. Would we still scale those down by some hard-coded factor? Or would we keep the first batch unchanged, even if it ends up being the same or even larger than the latter (explicitly specified) batches?\r\nThe scaledown factor is a bit nicer in this respect because it doesn't require users to take care of the size of the first batch if they don't want to. At the same time, it makes the first batch's size adapt in a reasonable and consistent way if users change some of the other batch parameters."
