      "You know, I sort of think the scaledown factor might be better.  It has the behavior you want if people don't bother to specify it (since it's a factor rather than a raw value), and I'm having trouble thinking of times when I want to adjust just one maximum value for the first batch.  4 options instead of 6 with more intuitive behavior seems like a win, especially since I think 3 of those 6 options would see very little use.  The scaledown approach is also more flexible if we switch to some sort of smarter batch sizing in the future.\r\n\r\n(There's also the fact that it's already implemented.)"
