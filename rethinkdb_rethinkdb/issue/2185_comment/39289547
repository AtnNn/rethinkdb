      "@srh: The main reason for it being a factor is that the batch size is already divided down internally, to account for the fact that we have multiple shards. Having the first batch size as a factor means that those size-reduction operations can just be chained together and we don't have to explicitly handle the first_batch_size when we go to the individual shards. It just makes the implementation simpler.\r\n\r\nWe could certainly change that for a user facing API. If the user doesn't specify `first_batch_size`, would it still be implicitly downscaled from the regular batch size?"
