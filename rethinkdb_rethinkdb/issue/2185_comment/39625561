      "@coffeemug The problem is that users have to be aware of the existence of the `first_batch` options and what they do, or they might be surprised when changing some batch option but not seeing any impact on the first batch.\r\nFor example somebody specifying `batch_max_rows: 1` would probably expect to only receive single-document batches. But unless they also set `first_batch_max_rows: 1` that wouldn't be the case.\r\nI don't know, I feel like not having an automatic scale down makes the interface more cumbersome to use."
