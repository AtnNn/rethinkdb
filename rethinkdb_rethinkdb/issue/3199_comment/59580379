      "The only reason that i would recommend r.switch over r.branch is as a user first looking at rethinkdb and trying to find a way to do condations r.branch does not sound like its going to be for what i amlooking for i think it was @AtnNn that showed me that command. But as a devloper seeing a command called switch sounds like a switch statment.i would ad r.switch and deperatcate r.branch."
