      "I might be thinking about this wrong, but I'm not sure if this will help to simplify any code for the user.\r\nThe changefeed might still fail after it has been started and has to be recreated. So all the code for retrying - with the exception of the `wait` call - still has to exist, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure how big the difference between changefeeds and regular queries really is in this respect. It probably depends a lot on how changefeeds are used in the application.\r\n\r\nThe implicit `wait` would avoid unintentionally getting into busy waiting when retrying the changefeed creation over and over.\r\nThough it also involves the risk of hiding an issue and making it seem like the changefeed was created successfully, while it's really waiting for the table to become available. The user wouldn't see any changes during that time."
