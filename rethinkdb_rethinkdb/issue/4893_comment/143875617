      "> So all the code for retrying - with the exception of the `wait` call - still has to exist, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nYes. That still seems easier, though. If we want feeds to be dead simple, it sounds like something we should solve. (Eventually we should also solve the retrying part, but I think even small steps make a big difference)\r\n\r\nI agree with the problems you pointed out above; I'm not even sure that implicitly waiting is the right thing to do. But writing robust code right now *is* too complex for users (you have to loop and wait for every feed), and I think we need to find a way to simplify this process."
