      "We should keep in mind that running a table with only two or even just one replica is still a perfectly valid use case.\r\n\r\nI think at least equally important to this is that we make `emergency_repair` easier to discover. This has two parts:\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4392\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5267\r\n\r\nThat aside, I like the idea of indicating the status of automatic failover for a given table. I think this should be less of a warning, and more of a status indicator though. I imagine a line like this on the table details page in the web UI:\r\n\"[green] Automatic failover available\"\r\n\"[orange] Automatic failover not available. Read [link] for more information.\"\r\n\r\nThe web UI could check the number of voting replicas from the configuration to obtain this information.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced that putting this in the `reconfigure` output is necessary. Though adding a `notes` or `warnings` field certainly wouldn't be the worst idea."
