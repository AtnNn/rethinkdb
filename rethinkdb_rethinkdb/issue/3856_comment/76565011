      "If I were to make this change myself, I would probably put a button on each table row that shows just on hover. When clicked, it would set the localStorage value `current_query` to the prefillled in query (just `r.db().table()`) and then navigate to the data explorer view.\r\n\r\nThoughts? If I were to approach it this way, would the PR be accepted?"
