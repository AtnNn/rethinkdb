        "SSL support is being added to the drivers for use at Compose.io (but not the server at this point). We need to add tests to make sure that we don't introduce regressions in that behavior. The easiest way of doing this is probably to expand on the SSL support in `test/rql_test/connections/http_support/server.py` and make a simple proxy to a server that we spin up for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAn example of a socket proxy can be found at: http://voorloopnul.com/blog/a-python-proxy-in-less-than-100-lines-of-code/"
