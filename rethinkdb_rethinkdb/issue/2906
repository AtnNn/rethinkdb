        "I'm a little unhappy with the current proposal for configuring tables and getting their status.  It looks like this right now:\r\n\r\n```rb\r\n> r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_config')\r\n[{name: \"db_name.table_name\",\r\n  uuid: ...,\r\n  ...\r\n  },\r\n ...\r\n]\r\n> r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_status')\r\n[{name: \"db_name.table_name\",\r\n  uuid: ...,\r\n  ...\r\n  },\r\n ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\nAnd if you want to e.g. change `db.table`'s blood type to be `a`, you'd write:\r\n```rb\r\n> r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_config').get('db_name.table_name').update({blood_type: 'a'})\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are the problems I have with it:\r\n* It treats tables like top-level objects.\r\n  - Everything else treats tables as being contained in databases.\r\n  - It requires using 'db_name.table_name' as the primary key.\r\n    * If you have a name from the configuration, and you want to get the table, you have to write `name.split('.').do{|x| r.db(x[0]).table(x[1])}`.\r\n  - Per-db permissions become a problem when we want to implement them.\r\n* It introduces a bunch of questions, and doesn't act like a normal table.\r\n  - Should you be able to create and drop tables by inserting and deleting into this table?\r\n    - If so, now we have two ways to do things.\r\n    - If not, why not?  It's yet another way this table doesn't act like a normal table.\r\n* There are multiple ways to get to things.\r\n  - Want to see what machines a table is sharded over?  You have to write `r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_config').get('db_name.table_name')['shards']` (or something).\r\n  - Want to see what indexes exist on a table?  You have to write `r.db('db_name').table('table_name').index_list()`.\r\n  - **Want to see the status of a table?  You have to write `r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_status').get('db_name.table_name')`.**\r\n  - **Want to see the status of the indexes on that table?  You have to write `r.db('db_name').table('table_name').index_status()`.**\r\n\r\nHere's an alternate proposal: we define two commands `table_config` and `table_status` on `db`.  Then things look like this:\r\n```rb\r\n> r.db('db').table_status() # get the status of all tables\r\n> # note the similarity to `r.db('db').table_list()` and `r.db('db').table('table').index_status()`\r\n> r.db('db').table_status('table') # get the status of one table\r\n> r.db('db').table_config() # get a selection on the configuration of all tables\r\n> r.db('db').table_config('table') # get a single row selection on a table\r\n> r.db('db').table_config('table').update({blood_type: 'a'}) # update a table's blood type\r\n```"
