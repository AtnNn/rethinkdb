        "We'd like our cache's data structures to use less memory.  We'd also like the serializer's data structures to do the same thing, yes.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose we have an 8-byte pointer for every block in a 1 TB database, and the average block size is 512 bytes.  Then we'd need 16 GB of memory for just the _pointers_ to the other data structures about the block.\r\n\r\n1. There are some simple improvements we could make that would give us headroom.  Some places where we have intrusive lists with a head and tail pointer, we could have an intrusive list with just a head pointer. The `page_ptr_t` does not need its own `page_cache_t *`.  Maybe a uint32_t could be used in place of some uint64_t's.  Some fields only used when loading the page could be temporarily allocated on the heap.\r\n\r\n2. `current_page_t`'s that have evicted pages and no acquirers could be freed.  Tracked in #2137.\r\n\r\n"
