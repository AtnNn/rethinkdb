      "@danielmewes #1863 is obviously the preferable and long-term solution. In the mean time I was thinking we could just store the binary representation. When inserting into `config_templates`, `function` could accept either a valid secondary index expression or the binary representation; just like `.indexCreate()`. When retrieving rows from `config_templates` you would always just get the binary back, though, not an expression the drivers can deserialize.\r\n\r\nThis would keep us in line with the output of `.indexStatus()` and work essentially the same as how the Python admin scripts currently dump/restore secondary indexes."
