      "> I suggest that rather than having a field `table: \"*\"` as a wildcard, the `table` field is completely omitted from entries that apply to the whole database.\r\n\r\nI mostly agree for the sake of consistency with the `permissions` table. It will be a little odd to have things like `indexes` and `settings.primary_key` specified without a `table` designator, since those aren't applied at the database level. It's not that out of place though since technically `shards/replicas` are both table settings too.\r\n\r\nWould you say the `db` field should also be omitted in the wildcard case?\r\n\r\nNote that Elasticsearch supports suffix and prefix wildcards as well, which is very useful for things like time-series and log rotation where you suffix the table name with a timestamp. If we're going to support things like `table: \"logs_*\"`, defaulting to `\"*\"` might be a little more clear. I don't have very strong opinions though."
