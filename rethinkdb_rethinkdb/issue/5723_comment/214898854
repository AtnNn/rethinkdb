      "Thanks for writing up this proposal @marshall007 .\r\n\r\nThis would be a solution to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3335 .\r\n\r\nI quite like this. I think the general priorities of conflicting rules should be the same as in the `permissions` table (i.e. like you say, the more specific entry wins).\r\n\r\nI suggest that rather than having a field `table: \"*\"` as a wildcard, the `table` field is completely omitted from entries that apply to the whole database. This again would be consistent with the `permissions` table, as well as with the `stats` table."
