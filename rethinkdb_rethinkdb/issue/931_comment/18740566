      "Here's an updated timeline from the user:\r\n\r\n1. Create a cluster of two machines\r\n2. Fill the cluster with a non-trivial amount of data (enough that\r\nsecondary index creation takes some time)\r\n3. Start secondary index 's' creation on the data on server 1\r\n4. Wait 12 hours for index to build\r\n5. Look in webui and see that index 's' is listed\r\n6. Query server 2 for indexList - new index appears\r\n7. Query server 2 using dataexplorer and new index - received\r\n\"RqlRuntimeError: Index `s` was not found. in:\"\r\n8. Query server 1 for  indexList - new index appears\r\n9.  Query server 1 using dataexplorer and new index - server crashes, all rethinkdb threads are gone. (restart server and this step is repeatable)\r\n10. Kill server 1, delare it dead\r\n11. Serve 2 no longer shows index 's' and does not return it on indexList\r\n\r\n"
