      "I'm not sure whether the docs or the code are incorrect here.  I'm like 55% sure that we should change to doing what the docs say so that `r([{a: 1}, {}]).min('a')` produces the same result as `r([{a: 1}, {a: nil}]).min('a')`.  (Usually people want `null` and non-existence to behave the same way, and I think this behavior is also more useful; if you have occasionally-missing fields you don't want to get `null` back when you ask for the minimum field.)\r\n\r\nSince the docs say we should be doing something different and that also seems like the correct thing to me, I would guess that we used to behave differently and this is a regression.  Marking as a bug and putting in 2.0.x."
