      "I +1 the issue with null being inconsistent. I was in the chat just a week ago with issues relating to this. One thing I find odd is that in the and / or (or any/all) commands null is considered falsey and you could end with a null value. Chaining .coerceTo('bool') to the end causes an error though as: \r\n\r\n````\r\nr.expr(null).coerceTo('bool')\r\n````\r\n  \r\nis an error. \r\n  "
