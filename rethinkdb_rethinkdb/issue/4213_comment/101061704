      "@danielmewes -- OK, let's document the current behavior for now and discuss this during a ReQL discussion period.  (I agree that we're pretty inconsistent on how we handle `null` values.  Arguably we should have comparisons with `NULL` produce a non-existence error instead of doing the comparison so that `r.table('test').filter{|row| row['maybe_null'] < 5}` does what you want, but that would be a pretty big change at this point.)"
