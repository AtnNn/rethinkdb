        "Elasticsearch rivers are on their way out, and the recommended replacement is logstash. Logstash handles realtime ETL between systems, so creating an input and output would allow RethinkDB to plug into RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, and other systems without needing a custom adapter for each system.\n\n(Thanks to @barkerja for the suggestion)\n\nhttp://logstash.net/docs/1.4.2/extending/\nexamples: https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash/tree/master/lib/logstash\n"
