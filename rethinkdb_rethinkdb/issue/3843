        "We had another user running into a case where sending large documents to the server was extremely slow. It becomes much faster when wrapping the document into `r.json`, like we used to do before we switched away from protocol buffers.\r\n\r\nWe should put that logic back in, at least until we can fix https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2900 which might be the reason for why things are slow without `r.json`.\r\n\r\nThis might also solve https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2919 (depending on whether we use `r.json` automatically for `setUnion` arguments or just for `insert`/`replace` etc.).\r\n\r\nWould be nice to get it into 2.0\r\n(@Tryneus, @mlucy, @VeXocide any takers?)"
