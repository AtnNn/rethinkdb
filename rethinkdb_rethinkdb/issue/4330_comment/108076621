      "I think the current terminology is a bit confusing because I can't quite tell from it what's going on. I presume \"configured\" means the user configured a server to be a primary replica but the election process hasn't started yet or is in progress, is that right? And \"elected primary replica\" is when the election process has ended but the replica hasn't transitioned into primary yet (but is in the process of doing so)?\r\n\r\n(I need to understand what's happening a bit better before I can propose better terms)"
