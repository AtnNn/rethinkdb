        "- We're evaluating rethinkdb, but our benchmark shows that single insert in rethinkdb **_is not good.**_\n- In addition, there're still [100 open issues](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/labels/tp%3Aperformance)  labeled \"tp:performance\"\n- Performance is our biggest concern and it become a blocker for us to adopt rethinkdb\n---\n\n**Test Bed**\n- db server : KVM virtual host in cloud,  8G, 100G ssd, 1Gbps, ubuntu 14.04 64bit,  rethinkdb: **v2.2.3** with default config (no direct-io)\n- load server: KVM virtual host  in cloud x3, 32 cores, 1Gbps, ubuntu 14.04 64bit\n- client driver : [gorethink](https://github.com/dancannon/gorethink/)\n- 1M docs in table.  (table durability = **\8220soft\"**)\n- **Single** insert per operation. (insert durability = **\8220soft\"**)\n- concurrent insert operation only (no read)\n\n**Test Result**\n\n![tbl](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/92157/12438339/d5666b4c-bf60-11e5-856a-8a51d86fb7e0.png)\n\n**Conclusion**\n- replica has big impact to insert performance\n- insert performance in replica cluster is not great (1k \8212 4k ops per shard)\n- scale out is  good,  2X shards gains 2X performance\n- scale up is  good,  change CPU from 4 cores to 8 cores gains 2X performance\n\nfor more detail of the benchmark,  see the attached pdf\n[Rethinkdb insert benchmark.pdf](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/files/96874/Rethinkdb.insert.benchmark.pdf)\n"
