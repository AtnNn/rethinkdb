        "Hello, I use this and think its great. With news of the company shutting down some people think they should stop using it.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't make sense to me since we have a strong open source dev community on this project.  So I plan to continue using RethinkDB, _unless_ somehow the project is retroactively being turned into closed source or something (is that even possible?).  \r\n\r\nNothing like that is going to happen right? People can continue working in this repo in the future?\r\n\r\nThanks."
