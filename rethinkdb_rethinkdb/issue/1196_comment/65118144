      "@neumino I'm not sure how that is related to `r.row`. Isn't that a property of how `r.desc` / `r.asc` work?\r\nSeems more related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3188\r\n\r\nI believe we don't allow nesting `r.row` inside other functions (e.g. `.map(function(x) { return x.map(r.row('f')); } )` wouldn't work I think).\r\nBut I believe you can generally nest it into all sorts of other terms, including `r.desc`."
