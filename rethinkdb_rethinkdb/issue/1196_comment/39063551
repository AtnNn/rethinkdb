      "@neumino -- I think @srh @mlucy and @atnnn are talking about revisiting erroring on nested `r.row` queries (which is separate from moving `r.row` to the server, which we should do).\r\n\r\nI don't think we should revisit nestedness -- people don't seem to complain about it, and I'm personally ok with the limitation. I don't think it's worth thinking about unless there are complaints."
