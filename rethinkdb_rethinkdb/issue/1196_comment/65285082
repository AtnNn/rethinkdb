      "Oh actually I do have a check for this in the PHP driver...\r\n\r\n@VeXocide just told me that we have no such special handling in the official Python driver. We should check if these queries work there or not.\r\n\r\n@chipotle @neumino once wrote this https://gist.github.com/neumino/5b8339c7f28d665f5900 guide on the JSON protocol, where handling of the implicit variable (`r.row`) is explained (issue https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/452 ). I believe we published that somewhere, but I cannot find it anymore.\r\nIf we have it on our website, we should mention the special corner case for `orderBy` in combination with `r.asc` and `r.desc`. Specifically, `r.desc`/`r.asc` must *not* be wrapped into a function even if their argument contains the implicit variable (`r.row`). Instead the function wrapping should happen inside `r.desc`/`r.asc`."
