      "I think we should try hard to retain the invariant that the tests pass on newton, since a lot of us do our development there.  The current behavior is that if you type `make py` in the `rql_test` directory it fails and aborts before even running the polyglot tests.  I think configuring the test to only run on Travis would be a great solution."
