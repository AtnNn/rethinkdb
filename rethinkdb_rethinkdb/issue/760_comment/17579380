      "All the tests pass fine when I run them locally. The only tests that don't pass on Newton are those that test the default host/port combo.\r\n\r\nThe tests are designed to test the API, the API specifies that by default the drivers connect to localhost:28015. To test this we need to either put a node on that port or ensure that there is not a node on that port. This is impossible to do on a shared machine like Newton where people are constantly spinning up RethinkDB instances or web servers and all want to use the same limited port range.\r\n\r\nSince Travis runs our test suite in a clean VM this isn't a problem and our build has never failed because of this test (though it has for plenty of other spurious reasons).\r\n\r\nSince this isn't really an issue I'm inclined to just let it be. I don't want to just remove the test because then we're leaving out an important piece of the API definition (the default host/port combo) from our testing system."
