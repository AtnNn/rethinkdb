      "What would the semantics of a symbol data type be within ReQL? Would it behave just like a string?\r\n\r\nAlso, though I might be wrong about this, don't symbols in most languages need to be statically defined in the client code?\r\nSo if a symbol isn't defined in the client, we couldn't actually convert a symbol stored in a RethinkDB document back into a client symbol, could we?"
