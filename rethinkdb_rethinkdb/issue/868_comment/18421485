      "I think if someone is scanning our documentation trying to figure out \"how do I insert something in to a set\" they're definitely going to find `set_insert` but it might be a small jump to figure out to use `set_union`. Most implementation's seem to have an explicit insert command for sets so I'd kind of like to follow their lead. Although I'm not adamant about it."
