      "I agree with @neumino that `append` and `prepend` are better than `push_back` and `push_front`.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of cutsy operators, keep in mind that we have to give a name for each of these operations anyway for languages that don't support operator overloading. If we want to be able to use `-` for difference then we should be willing to call it `sub` in non-overloading languages. If we'd be uncomfortable calling it sub then we probably don't want to overload `-`.\r\n\r\nIf we adopt everything in this proposal then we will now have 3 different forms of union:\r\n* `union` - preserves duplicates, no ordering guarantee\r\n* `set_union` - eliminates duplicates, no ordering guarantee\r\n* `+` or `add` on arrays - preserves duplicates, ordering guarantee\r\n\r\nIs there any way we can simplify this?\r\n\r\n"
