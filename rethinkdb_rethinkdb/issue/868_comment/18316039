      "Does distinct() work on arrays? If not, would it make sense to make it work on arrays?\r\nI think distinct would make the set_ operations unnecessary. Plus it would have the added benefit of having a well-defined behaviour when the input to a set operation is not itself a set (i.e. contains duplicates).\r\n\r\nEdit: Well, it would make set_union unnecessary. set_intersection should probably still have that name. In general I am not sure what should happen when set_intersection is applied to a a non-set. One could for example make it non-commutative and keep all elements of the first array that also occur in the second array. For sets it would still be commutative and behave as expected. For non-sets it could still be useful. It would basically be pluck() for arrays."
