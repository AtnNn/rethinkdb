      "`is_empty` was buried in another proposal, but I think we should merge it into this one.\r\n\r\n* I think `delete_at` should take the end point of a range rather than a number to delete.  It seems mildly more useful.\r\n* I agree on `index_of` taking a block.\r\n* `seq.difference(arr)` is the same as `seq.filter {|x| r.not(arr.contains(x)}`."
