      "> delete_at -- r([1,2,3]).delete_at(1) => [1, 3] or r([1,2,3,4]).delete_at(1,2) => [1,4]\r\n\r\nDo you mean for 2 to be the length, or do you mean for the interval to be inclusive?  Note that #869 proposes making intervals be half-open by default.\r\n\r\n> set_intersection -- set_union -- set_difference\r\n\r\nIt's unclear whether this function makes any guarantees about ordering of output.\r\n\r\n> difference\r\n\r\nI'm real confused how this is different from set_difference.\r\n\r\n> `index_of`.\r\n\r\nThis could take a function that returns a bool, in addition to just a value.  The same way as `count`.  Also, should we have `last_index_of`?\r\n\r\n> `empty`\r\n\r\nNobody mentioned `empty()`, returning a boolean.  I think we should add this.  Edit: vv #871.\r\n\r\n> `push_back`, `push_front`\r\n\r\nIn almost all languages these names imply in-place mutation of an array, which isn't the behavior we'd have."
