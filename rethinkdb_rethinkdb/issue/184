        "Hello. I am evaluating RethinkDB, but my infrastructure is remote, so I do not have simple secure access to the administration panel. I guess I can forward some ports over SSH, come to think about it, but that would probably be somewhat annoying on each of the new clients I sit down at; however, given that it is just a few lines of configuration to do this in Apache, I simply setup a virtual host over SSL (yes: with an actually-valid SSL certificate) using mod_proxy and HTTP authentication, I just went ahead and set up the proxy.\r\n\r\nHowever, it didn't work, as the client interface is hardcoded to work only over http://. In fact, even just fixing this was not sufficient, as it also seems to then auto-detect and force port 80. Once I changed the url definition (manually, in the installed minified JavaScript code, which was thankfully quite trivial to find in /usr/share) it worked perfectly, however, so I imagine this is just a matter of auto-detecting the protocol and port from the current URL (or just making the URL an absolute path relative to the existing scheme and authority)."
