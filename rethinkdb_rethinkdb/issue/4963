        "In the latest version of MacOS X (10.11 or El Capitan) the OpenSSL library is present, but the headers are not, even with Xcode command-line tools installed. This is intentional, and is the next ratchet in Apple's slow depreciation of OpenSSL.\r\n\r\nThe main work-around is easy, just add `--fetch openssl` to the `./configure` invocation, but we need to strengthen our checks in that script to ensure that we pickup the lack of headers and complain about it during `./configure` rather than at compile time."
