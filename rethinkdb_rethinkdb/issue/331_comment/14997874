      "In `michel_331_brace_pairing`, there are two improvements \r\n- Complete any bracket if it balances the number of opened/closed brackets\r\n- Complete single/double quote if it balances the number of opening/closing quote for string\r\n- Removing the first quote of an empty string remove both quotes if the number of quotes is even\r\n- Selecting text and hitting a quote, wrap the selection in quotes\r\n- Fix indentation. The problem was (I think) for query like\r\n```\r\nr.db(\"foo\").table(\"bar\").filter( 'test'\r\n```\r\nIf the user were to hit enter, it would indent to filter. We now indent like the previous line + 2 tabs if we are in the middle of a method.\r\n\r\nI have tested it with Chrome/Firefox on OS X and Linux. I'll still run another set of test this week end or next week before opening the code review.\r\n\r\n\r\n@coffeemug since you are the most picky one when it comes to autocompletion/pairing/indentation, once you have recovered from yesterday, could you take a look and tell me if that's good for you?\r\nIt's running on `http://newton:25000` or build it from branch `michel_331_brace_pairing`"
