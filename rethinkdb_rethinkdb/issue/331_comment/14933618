      "So brackets looks pretty cool, but it's more than just an editor, is a whole IDE. So stripping out what we need from brackets is just too much work and to much pain to update/maintain.\r\n\r\nI just tried to seriously use ace but I think using it for the data explorer is not a good idea because their api is a more high level one compared to the one of CodeMirror. Some examples:\r\n- Accessing keydown can be down by extending (not overwriting) `editor.keyBinding.onKeyCommand`\r\n- I couldn't find how to access keypress/keyup\r\n- They give us the way to detect onfocus, but not clicks.\r\n\r\nSo if I want to use Ace, I would have to change the source code of Ace and that means it's going to be a pain to update/maintain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I'm just going to write a little function for CodeMirror for the closing parenthesis/curly bracket/square bracket/apostrophe/double quotes. It's going to save me a lot of time.\r\n\r\nAbout the indentation, as far as I can tell, the indentation on ACE is not better than on CodeMirror."
