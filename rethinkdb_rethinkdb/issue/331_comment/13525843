      "I just tried upgrading Codemirror with the version 3.02, but that didn't change any of our problems.\r\n\r\nI just took a quick look at ACE. I'm not sure that it's going to solve our problem related to indentation, but there are at least two interesting features:\r\n- Find missing brackets - I was going to implement my own function on top of codemirror.\r\n- Auto complete parenthesis AND overwrite them when the user close them.\r\n\r\nI'll take a closer look at ACE and the other editors later to see how it's going to work with our current data explorer.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to move to an other editor like ACE, then we are definitively not going to implement a shell style data explorer right?"
