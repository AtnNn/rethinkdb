        "@mfenniak raised a problem in rethinkdb-dev where the server rejects protobufs generated by rethinkdb-net.  Apparently the protobuf spec allows you to omit optional fields if they would be set to their default value:\r\nhttps://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#optional\r\n\r\nWe should change the server to accept all valid protobufs by fixing `validate_pb` in `validate.cc`.  (We also discovered another bug while looking into this, namely that we don't recurse into `Datum` protobufs in `validate.cc`.)"
