        "It would be great to expose the server stats via HTTP, similarly to [Elasticsearch's stats](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-stats.html) or variety of information available in [RabbitMQ Admin plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html).\r\n\r\nWe use collectd to gather system, service and application level stats.  With [curl_json](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:cURL-JSON) plugin it's trivial to gather various statistics and push them to Graphite or InfluxDB. This way alerting becomes possible via solutions like Cabot.\r\n\r\nAdditionally one can inspect state of the cluster/server with curl, rather than using the web interface. \r\n\r\nAny pointers on how to make this happen would be appreciated - event though my C++ is **really rusty**  :wink: "
