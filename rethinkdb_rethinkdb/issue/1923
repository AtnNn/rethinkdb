        "I recompiled RethinkDB with -march=native (GCC 4.6.3) to see if it would improve performance (it did, a little).\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to load an existing database, the server crashed with a segmentation fault (reading from address NULL). After deleting the data directory and creating a new one, it seemed to work.\r\n\r\nA comment in `src/build.mk` reads 'march=native used to break the serializer'.\r\n\r\nI would like to find out what exactly it breaks, and hopefully fix it in our code. Having the correctness of RethinkDB depend on a compiler option like this one seems fragile."
