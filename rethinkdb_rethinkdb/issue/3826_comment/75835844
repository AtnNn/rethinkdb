      "Thank you for the issue report @bittrance .\r\nI think that is indeed a bug.\r\n\r\nAt least it doesn't match the documentation http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/each/ which says\r\n> If we need to know when the iteration is complete, each also accepts a second onFinished callback.\r\n\r\nSo I assume that if you only pass in one callback like in your example, it should simply stop calling that once the cursor is exhausted (or if it is exhausted from the beginning, never call the callback).\r\n\r\nPing @deontologician "
