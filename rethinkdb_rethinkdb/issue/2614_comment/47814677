      "I actually thing `group` does this correctly -- it limits the total number of datums to 100k, not the number of groups or the number of datums in each group.\r\n\r\nI think we should do that for arrays in general. They should be limited to 100k datums regardless of whether they're nested.\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure what to do with datums. We already have nesting depths on the client, but perhaps we should move it to the server and count the total number of elements of all arrays in the datum?"
