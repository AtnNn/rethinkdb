      "You'll be able to pretty much do that in reql-admin by using server tags.\r\n\r\nBasically you can create a server tag \"primary_ok\" into which you put all servers that are allowed to become a primary. Then you can pretty easily configure all tables to put their primaries on servers that have that tag.\r\n\r\nDo you think that would work for you?"
