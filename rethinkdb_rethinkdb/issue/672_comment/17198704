      "Moving back to 1.5.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should release 1.5 this Tuesday as too many things will be done last minute. I'd prefer to take another couple of days to fix silly bugs and make sure we have a smooth release.\r\n\r\nIn general, the reason to rush issues for a sprint isn't to have them make it into a release, though. Sprints are really useful for all the reasons we know about -- bounding time estimate mistakes, giving ourselves a sense of momentum, forcing ourselves not to over-engineer, etc. Empirically, I think they work much better when everyone makes significant effort to make it. Otherwise a sprint isn't much of a sprint.\r\n\r\nOf course the reality of software is that even with a significant effort to make it, some things don't. It's ok, but I think we shouldn't be too cavalier about missing the sprint deadline. (I'm saying that here because I think there are very compelling reasons to worry about getting things in on time, it's just that in many cases we can't do it despite our best efforts)"
