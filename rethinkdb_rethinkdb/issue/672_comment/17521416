      "Right now this branch is being held back by the code crashing, bugs existing.  There is the question of whether the bugs are in this branch or in next (but didn't show in next thanks to lax gc).  See, for example, issue #614.  Either way, this branch is an avenue to investigate the bugs seen in this branch.\r\n\r\nOne particular worrisome discovery is that in this branch, some func_t, datum_t, val_t, and term_t shared pointers have been found to be destructed on a different thread than they were created!  This seems completely absurd and horrible.  The concern is not necessarily the shared pointers -- some pointer code might be non-broken if it passes a raw pointer, but that's not the scary part.  The real WTF here is why non-const types like func_t and val_t are being seen passed around like this.  It is completely ridiculous to write code this way."
