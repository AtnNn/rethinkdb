      "I'm skeptical of changing its behavior for pseudotypes.  At least, with this proposal, there is no value field, but there is for other types (the serialized JSON, as far as I can tell).  This means anybody that wants to get the value field of values (which is presumably used by something) will have to special-case the behavior on time types."
