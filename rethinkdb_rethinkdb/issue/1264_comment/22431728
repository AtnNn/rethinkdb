      "The reason for `.info()` is to allow the user to get some useful information about tables for things like data export, migrations, and all sorts of higher order tools. For example, it's the only way to know what is the primary key on a table (so we can dump data and then recreate it later using the same primary key). I believe it provides a few other useful bits of information that some of our tools use, but I can't think of them.\r\n\r\nWhen @mlucy was implementing this on table (and may be db) because we needed it, he also decided to add a meaning for `info` on all other commands for completeness sake (which is nice). The function is admittedly not so useful on most types, so it doesn't matter much what it returns there."
