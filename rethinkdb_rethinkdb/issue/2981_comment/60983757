      "I think having `rebalance` wait until it's done is a bad idea.\r\nMost clients will have timed out by then, and users will think that the `rebalance` has failed.\r\n\r\nAlso users might get confused over what happens if they close the connection in the middle. Is the `rebalance` interrupted? Is it reversed? Neither will be the case I think, but I think many people will instinctively leave the connection open while it is running at all cost. That in turn comes with the problem that they will have to open another connection for continuing whatever administration job they were doing if the given `rebalance` wasn't the last thing on their list."
