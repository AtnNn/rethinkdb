      "I think we should consider not adding an optarg or a command. The UX here is pretty confusing because the implications aren't clear. What exactly does it mean to rebalance vs not rebalance? What does it mean to drop the number of shards and not rebalance? Where does the data on the dropped shard go? As a user, when should I call this command and when shouldn't I (or alternatively, set the flag to true)? The whole thing is surprisingly confusing.\r\n\r\nHere are a few options:\r\n\r\n- Always rebalance when the user calls `reconfigure()`/writes to `table_config` no matter what.\r\n- Always rebalance when the number of shards changes.\r\n\r\nI think either of these two options is fine (I'd have to think a bit about which one is better). The whole idea of rebalancing will go away when we move to consistent hashing, so I think we shouldn't introduce the option now if at all possible."
