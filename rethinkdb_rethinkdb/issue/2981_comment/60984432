      "I think returning the status in a way similar to `reconfigure` would be good. The same considerations as here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3223 would apply, except that we are only interested in the `status` and not in the `config`.\r\n\r\nI propose we make `rebalance` return\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  old_status: {...}\r\n  new_status: {...}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`new_status` will typically have all shards unavailable, but I think that is fine for the same reasons for which it is for `reconfigure`."
