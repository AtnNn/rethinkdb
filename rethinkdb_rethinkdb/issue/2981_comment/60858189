      "After offline discussion, we decided to use a distribution query to calculate new shard points whenever the number of shards changes. The number of shards could change either by the user calling `reconfigure()` or writing to `rethinkdb.table_config`. If the distribution query fails, we give the user an error; since we use outdated reads, this can only happen if there are no replicas available for a shard. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we'll have a rebalance command. I propose the following syntax: `r.table(\"foo\").rebalance()`. The return value is `{ rebalanced: 1 }`. It can also be called on a database to rebalance all the tables in the database."
