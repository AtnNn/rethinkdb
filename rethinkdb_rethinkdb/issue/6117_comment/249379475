      "Support for zero-argument logical operations was added in RethinkDB 2.3 https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4696 , which will give you the correct result if you simply pass all conditions into a single `r.and` or `r.or` call through `r.args` (i.e. `r.and(r.args([array of conditions]))`).\r\n\r\nDoes that solve your use case?\r\n\r\nYou can also just use `false` and `true` obviously. No need to use fields on `D.row`:\r\n```js\r\nlet andID = r.expr(true);\r\nlet orID = r.expr(false);\r\n```\r\nThe `r.expr` is so that you can call ReQL functions on the values directly."
