      "@coffeemug - Is there anything I can to do to convince you to move this back to 1.14? I think I started the conversation that opened this issue in January[0] and I have eagerly been awaiting its completion. I thought it made it into 1.13 but I was wrong. This is actually the ONE issue that is forcing me to use MongoDB's aggregation framework over RethinkDB.\r\n\r\nThe lack of this feature severely limits RethinkDB from doing any real analytics aggregations right now (so often the count of distinct <property> of an event is as important of count of event - e.g. unique users/visitors to an application).\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider!\r\n\r\n[0] - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rethinkdb/distinct/rethinkdb/vGqLvYtWtkE/OJXALpPLhvYJ"
