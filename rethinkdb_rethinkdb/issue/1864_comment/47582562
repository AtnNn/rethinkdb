      "For the record, `distinct` with an index will be better than that -- the object solution still requires space proportional to the number of distinct elements (rather than the total number of elements in the stream), while indexed distinct doesn't.\r\n\r\n(Also, this would be a good second-tier project for Graham when he shows up, because it isn't too hard but doing it right touches the aggregator code, the unsharding code, and the datum stream code.)"
