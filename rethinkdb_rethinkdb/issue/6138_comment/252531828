      "@geekyme Well, I disagree with the allegation of marketing, its not my repo anyway. Arguably Horizon is a different repo too yet maintained by the original RethinkDB team. This effort here is basically an extension of what RethinkDB can do. \r\n\r\nIncreasing interest in RethinkDB is in the interest of all who want to see it move forward.\r\n\r\nFor sake of strategy, consider that Meteor drives a lot of commercial business to MongoDB. Yet its basically an elaborate hack. RethinkDB offers an elegant solution for the community in this regard.  Where MiniMongo fails to effectively work in React Native, this tool works well. Its also far more powerful than MiniMongo. Writing ReQL queries directly from a native app is pretty powerful. \r\n\r\nTLDR; this isn't about marketing. Its about strategy and increasing interest. Writing ReQL directly in the client--React Native, Electron, etc., is powerful and unmatched. "
