      "Ooh, perfect, just what I was looking for. Also, slack is terrible, rethinkdb doesn't pay for it so the message history only goes back 10000 entries. Most of that history is now lost, nobody's archived it, there's no logs that I can find, unlike the IRC channel, which has been dead as a doorknob since the whole \"support\" thing was introduced."
