      "Exposing secondary index configuration through a pseudo-table adds a lot of power. In a good way.\r\n\r\nHowever, it also makes the implementation harder. Because secondary index information is currently not stored in the semilattices or the directory, we would have to run a read query to get it, and that can fail. But the `table_config` pseudo-table needs to remain accessible whether or not the cluster is capable of handling read queries. So we would have to come up with some way to fail gracefully in that case. Even if the read works, the latency for reading is much higher than the latency of anything else that we do when performing a pseudo-table read. (These issues would go away if we store sindexes in the semilattices as discussed in #2904.)"
