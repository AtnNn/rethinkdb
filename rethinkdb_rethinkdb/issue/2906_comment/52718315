      "After offline discussion between me, @coffeemug, and @mlucy, we came up with the following:\r\n\r\n* There will still be a magic `rethinkdb` database with magic `table_config` and `table_status` tables. These will use UUID as the primary key, and have fields for table name and database.\r\n\r\n* Databases will have methods `table_config()` and `table_status()`. Called with no arguments, they are equivalent to filtering the magic `rethinkdb.table_config` and `rethinkdb.table_status` tables by database. Called with a table name, they return a single-row selection which points to the row for the table in that database with the given name.\r\n\r\nIt's true that this gives the user multiple ways to do things, but it's OK because the methods are a porcelain over the underlying magic database."
