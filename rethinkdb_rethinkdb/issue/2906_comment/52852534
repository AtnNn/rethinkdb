      "That's a good point. I think that `r.table_create()` should keep its current behavior, but writing to the pseudo-table should not wait for the table to be ready. We should implement the proposed `r.table_wait()`. Then we can implement `r.table_create()` as a porcelain on `rethinkdb.table_config`, `table.reconfigure()`, and `r.table_wait()`."
