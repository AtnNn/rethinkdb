      "I'd start with `system` and then come back to this question when we get to the stage of playing with the changes. `$system` or `$rethinkdb` also sounds reasonable, but right now we don't allow dollar signs in table/database names, so this would require a more extensive change. I'd consider waiting on this until we get to the second part of the process (the playing with the software part), otherwise it's too much to deal with at once."
