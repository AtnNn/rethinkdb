For example, what does it mean to have {role: 'nothing'}? (I know what it means, but to a user, it's very confusing when this shows up)\n> \n> I think with a few changes in wording, this could be a helpful field. I propose the following:\n> \n> ```\n> { goal: 'become_replica' }\n> { goal: 'become_primary_replica' }\n> { goal: 'recuse_responsibilities' }\n> ```\n> \n> I would drop the goal field entirely when the goal is satisfied -- this would be a transient field that shows up when the replica is in a process of transition.\n\nDiscuss, settle, implement.\n"
