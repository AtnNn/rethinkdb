      "I had a really hard time reproducing it on my local machine. I thought that my clicking speed was not good enough, but testing it on newton was easier.\r\n\r\nWhat happened is in case the id_execution doesn't match, we were calling execute_portion (which execute a query) when we shouldn't. We should just ignore the results in this case (= do nothing since we are waiting for more recent data or received more recent data).\r\n\r\n\r\nBranch `michel_1222_null_cursor`\r\nReview 803 assigned to @mglukhovsky \r\nShip 1.8"
