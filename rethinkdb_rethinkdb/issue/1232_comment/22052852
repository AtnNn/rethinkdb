      "This is probably related to the fact that we're throwing and catching an exception.  In the short term, I think we should have `default` install a condition handler in the environment and have terms like `[]` that frequently produce non-existence errors use that (if present) rather than throwing.  (It would be significantly more work to change our error handling to behave like this in the general case, but I think we could patch 95% of the performance problem with 5% of the work.)\r\n\r\nIn the long term, we should move off of exceptions for our handling of recoverable errors."
