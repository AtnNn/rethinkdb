      "Part of what makes this slow is that our exceptions contain a lot of information which must be collected and partially formatted. For example we create a backtrace, and in the case of a non-existence error in `datum_t::get(key, throw_bool)` print the whole document into a string (`print().c_str()`).\r\n\r\nThere still seems to be more to it though."
