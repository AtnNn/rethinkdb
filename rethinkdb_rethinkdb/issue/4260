This makes even simple expressions difficult to read:\n\n``` js\nr.js('(function (row) { return row.magazines.length > 5; })')\n```\n\nFortunately, in JS you can call [`Function.prototype.toString()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/toString) to get the entire function declaration back as a string. In the JS driver when the user passes a function to `r.js` we could simply convert it to a string before passing it through.\n\n``` js\nr.js(function (row) {\n  return row.magazines.length > 5;\n})\n```\n"
