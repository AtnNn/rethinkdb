      "For those (like me) who don't/didn't know; `.swo` (and `.swp, `.swn`, etc..) files are created when you open a file for editing in `vim`. The first concurrent editor makes a `.swp` file, and then they progressively march down the alphabet starting with `.swo`.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think that stuff like this belongs in your own `git` preferences, but we already have a `*.swp` entry, so there is precedent."
