        "```\r\nr.expr({}).filter(r.row('a').gt(0)).run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will throw a type error (\"Expected Array, got Object\"), but won't say what the offending object (`{}`) is. It's clear in this example, but it would be immensely useful for debugging to return the object in general. There are a few associated questions:\r\n\r\n1. What are we doing for missing attributes (we used to return the offending object)? Presumably we'll now attach it to the `Maybe/Nothing` object (assuming we use that instead of exceptions).\r\n2. How do we deal with printing really large (e.g. 10MB) documents? We should limit them in some way (e.g. print the first K fields, in addition to the offending one, limit arrays, etc.)\r\n\r\nAlso, we want to return the actual object as a datum from the server and serialize it on the client (instead of returning the serialized string from the server). This would be nice for languages where the object syntax is different (e.g. ruby)."
