        "The [`.hasFields`](http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/has_fields/) method converts a \"SELECTION<STREAM>\" into a \"STREAM\". `.filter`, on the other hand, keeps the original reference to the selection. The functionality between these seems similar enough that I would have expected `.hasFields` to keep the reference to the source rows through the \"SELECTION\". \n\nIs it possible for `.hasFields` to return a \"SELECTION<STREAM>\" when provided a \"SELECTION<STREAM>\", instead of returning a \"STREAM\"? All this is also true for \"SELECTION<ARRAY>\".\n\nExample Queries:\n\n```\nr.db('caltrain').table('trains')\n .between(300, 400, {'index': 'number'})\n .orderBy({'index': 'number'})\n .filter({'direction': 'north'})\n .typeOf() // \"SELECTION<STREAM>\"\n```\n\n```\nr.db('caltrain').table('trains')\n .between(300, 400, {'index': 'number'})\n .orderBy({'index': 'number'})\n .filter({'direction': 'north'})\n .hasFields({'stations': true})\n .typeOf() // \"STREAM\"\n```\n"
