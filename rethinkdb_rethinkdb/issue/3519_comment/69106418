      "Generally we often had random terms break when being run on sharded tables, so having some way to run all the polyglot tests on a sharded table I think is still useful.\r\nHowever it sounds like it would be difficult to ensure that the data that individual tests are inserting actually ends up on different shards? So at least with the current implementation this might be close to useless, and I would be fine with removing it."
