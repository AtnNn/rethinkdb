      "We are not currently running the tests with sharding, but it has been an option in `test-runner` (currently broken).\r\n\r\nAnd yes... I think that the central (and fatal) flaw is that we can't do this in a way that would make it likely that the data would not wind up on only a single shard.\r\n\r\nIt would not be difficult to add sharding to any individual tests, but I don't see an automated way of doing this to all."
