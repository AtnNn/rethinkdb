      "We've had lots of bugs in the past that only show up in sharded situations.  Since a lot of our random regression tests are in the polyglot tests, it would be really nice if we could run them in a sharded environment.  Even just sharding based on the assumption of UUID primary keys seems better than not sharding at all."
