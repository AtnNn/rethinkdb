      "I noticed this problem about a week ago on newton -- table creation took about six seconds for me on next at the time. I was testing something else and forgot to report this issue. On 1.12.x table creation hovers around 1s for me on an SSD (which is high -- I opened #2498 as a separate issue to track that in subsequent)."
