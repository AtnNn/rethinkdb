      "I don't know out of my head. There have been some tweaks a couple of versions ago that optimized table creation more heavily towards larger clusters, at the expense of making it slightly slower on small clusters and single nodes. It shouldn't be 6 seconds though.\r\n\r\nAlso note that newton has some disk issues that can lead to stalls of up to a minute at the moment (on ssd3 at least).\r\n\r\nI'll look into it."
