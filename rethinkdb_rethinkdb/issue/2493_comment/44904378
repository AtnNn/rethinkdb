      "This is pretty weird. I measured the average time for `tableCreate` by running it 10 times and taking the average.\r\nOn newton (ssd3), I got the following average times:\r\n- v1.12.x: 4.3s\r\n- next: 3.7s\r\n\r\nBoth of these times seem too high.\r\n\r\nI ran the same measurement on electro on branch next.\r\nFirst on an SSD (like on newton): 1.0s\r\nThen on a rotational drive: 1.5s\r\n\r\nnewton behaving weirdly does seem to have something to do with it."
