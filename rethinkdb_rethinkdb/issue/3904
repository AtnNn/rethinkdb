        "I was just talking about this with @VeXocide .  Squashing by default only noticeably improves performance in the relatively uncommon case where you have a lot of changes to the same documents within our default window of 100ms.  In exchange for that improvement, we get higher latency and some very confusing behavior vis-a-vis ordering (see e.g. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3903).\r\n\r\n@VeXocide told me that he was confused by the behavior of squashing changefeeds several times while testing, and I think it's probably confusing for normal users too.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes -- I realize we're really close to the release, but this is like a 1-line fix and I think it will make changefeeds a lot less confusing for people in 2.0, do you might if we slip it in at the last minute here?\r\n\r\n(Also, @coffeemug, any objections?)"
