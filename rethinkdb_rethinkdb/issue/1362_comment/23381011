      "@coffeemug I looked at this before when it was part of the other pull request. As I said on that issue, while this fix looks fine to me I don't know if it fixes @jdoliner's original problem because I was never able to reproduce it for myself. Since only @jdoliner seems to be able to produce this problem I'd like him to confirm this fix. I'm still waiting on that.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this fix shouldn't hurt anything since under normal circumstances it should work as before. Still, I'm reluctant to just merge this until we understand what the problem is we're fixing. Python theoretically retries interrupted system calls on your behalf. If EINTR is leaking anyway then perhaps something else is going on here that we haven't figured out yet. Again, since I can't reproduce, I haven't been able to investigate this further."
