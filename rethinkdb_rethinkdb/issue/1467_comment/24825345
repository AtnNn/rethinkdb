      "This isn't an actual problem.\r\n\r\nI actually looked into this recently. It's timing related and fails intermittently. I suspect it has something to do with the performance changes to secondary indexes. Because we don't have a way right now to check if a sindex is up to date we just spawn coroutines and hope that it's up to date when we try to use it. I \"fixed\" this by having nap then retry a few times if the sindex isn't up to date."
