        "As part of #3442 I will be re-grouping the tests, as they have organically grown out of the original design. After a brief talk with @danielmewes here is the proposed layout (incomplete, but a working basis):\r\n- server\r\n  - admin\r\n  - changefeeds\r\n  - clustering (including the scenario tests)\r\n  - regression\r\n  - unit_tests\r\n- client\r\n  - changefeeds\r\n  - connection\r\n  - datum\r\n  - (most/all of `./test/rql_test/src/)\r\n  - regression\r\n- performance\r\n- fuzzing\r\n\r\nAny sort of test would be able to go at any point on this hierarchy, so for example YAML-format tests would be perfectly legal in `./test/server` (`test-runner` already allows for this). At the end of #3442 all of the current tests would reside in this same hierarchy.\r\n\r\nI will start working on this in the near future, and so would appreciate any improvements or kibitzing on this to come back soon."
