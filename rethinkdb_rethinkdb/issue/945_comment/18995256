      "The base is taken as an optional 4th parameter. It's then passed as the 'base' field of the optional arguments dict. The weird error checking here comes from the fact that it's using `aropt` to check the number of fields. The simple heuristic \"is the 4th value an object?\" is used to decided if this is an options dict or not which is why we get different results when it's a number. The distinction between 0 and 1 exists because 0 is falsy (and apparently the ? operator is CoffeeScript doesn't work as advertised, -1 one more for coffeescript).\r\n\r\nThe type error though is coming from the server. Why doesn't the server accept an object value as a base argument?\r\n\r\nFortunately, we don't have to worry about any of this because we're getting rid of the optional base argument. Michel was testing this for the docs and I think the most reasonable way forwards is to just remove all reference to the base argument from the docs *now* even if it's still technically in there."
