      "Can someone tell me why it's so hard to test backtraces?\r\nIsn't it just about matching a string to a regex? Sorry if it's a dumb question.\r\n\r\nI'm also opposed to having a unified output. It's painful enough (especially for first time users) to map a backtrace to the query they have just written."
