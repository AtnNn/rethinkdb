      "Comprehensive testing (polyglot style) is a great solution to many problems, but I think it's the wrong answer to the problem of chance code. It should be possible to write a reasonably good pretty-printer without having to test a huge variety of backtraces. It also should be possible to test the pretty printer with a fuzzer, independently from a polyglot-style set of tests.\r\n\r\nWe'll eventually get polyglot tests for backtraces working, but until then, I think we need to spend a little bit of time and put some care into the backtrace printer code."
