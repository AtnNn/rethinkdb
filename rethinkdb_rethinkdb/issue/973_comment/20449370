      "Changes related to this issue are now in next, review 701 by @neumino. It would seem as though @neumino's original query failed to print correctly due to the handling of optional arguments in backtrace frame traversal. I've fixed that as well a more recent issue introduced with the protobuf changes that caused all backtraces to print improperly. That this slipped by is again due to our lack of testing in this area.\r\n\r\n@neumino, backtrace pretty printing testing is hard because unless we get really clever it means manually typing out what each query should look like when printed by pretty printer. We would have to do this for a great many different edge cases to be confident the pretty printer worked well in most cases. Since pretty printing is fundamentally about aesthetics there are limits to how much automation we can involve in the process of testing this. It's hard to teach a computer, even when you have regexs, what should be considered a visual bug in a printed query.\r\n\r\nSince this problem that prompted this issue is fixed I'm going to close it. I'm going to open a new issue concerning testing backtraces generally."
