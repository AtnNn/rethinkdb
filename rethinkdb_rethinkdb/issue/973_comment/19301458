      "One option to deal with the original problem is to write a single *good* pretty printer on the server, and just use a unified syntax. It would have the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1. A single implementation, which means it's easier to reach high quality and to fix bugs.\r\n2. Client drivers can get a good pretty printer out of the box without any effort on the part of the implementors.\r\n3. As client drivers mature (or as we get more resources), we can implement custom *good* pretty printers on each driver. Until then, drivers can fall back to the server's pretty printer.\r\n\r\nThis has one drawback -- people would have to map the unified output to their specific language query. I think that's ok, for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I don't think this mapping is actually hard to do in one's head. I think it would be extremely intuitive most of the time.\r\n2. Having to do a mapping is still an order of magnitude better than not having to do a mapping but having a broken pretty printer (which is basically useless)."
