      "Can you explain a little bit more why this is a problem?\r\nCurrently `any` and `all` are in fact real terms. Do you think they should have different semantics?\r\n\r\nI agree that `and`/`or` with only one argument (counting the one that's left of the term, in this case `r.expr(true)`) doesn't make much sense. I'm not sure if there's enough reason to disallow it though.\r\n\r\nMaybe part of the confusion comes from the fact that we occasionally use the two names `any` and `or` / `all` and `and` interchangeably. I'm not entirely sure what the background of this is (@mlucy probably knows).\r\nIt seems that our API documentation only uses the `and`/`or` form nowadays and doesn't even mention `any`/`all`. I could imagine that we had `any`/`all` originally but switched over to `and`/`or` at some point."
