      "@danielmewes I didn't realize they were intended to be aliases to `and/or` since I couldn't find them in the docs. My expectation before consulting the docs was that `any` would be equivalent to `contains` and `all` would do something like [`Array.every()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every) in JS."
