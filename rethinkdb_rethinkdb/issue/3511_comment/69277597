      "`any` and `all` are considered \"real\" terms because they used to be the standard way to access `or` and `and`.  We did this because `or` and `and` are reserved in some languages, but `any` and `all` turned out to be confusing so we standardized on `or` and `and` instead.  I would also be in favor of remove `any` and `all` in 2.0; the only reason we haven't done it is to avoid breaking existing code.  (I would also possibly be on board with repurposing them to mean what they usually mean in Ruby.)\r\n\r\nWe let `and` and `or` take any number of arguments because it makes it easier to write generic code where you splice an array into a call to `r.and(...)`."
