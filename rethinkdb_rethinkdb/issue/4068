        "`returnChanges: true` used to return all the documents that the user is trying to update. With 2.0, RethinkDB returns only the documents that are actually updated. \n\nThinky was relying on the behavior pre-2.0 to let people do an update and get the new document, and this was really nice to build REST API (it makes things easier - you don't have to look for special values, empty arrays, weird ordering).\n\nAny chance to revert to the old behavior? Or add a new flag to force `changes` to be populated?\n"
