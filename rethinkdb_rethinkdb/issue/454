        "In the new query-language branch:\n\n(Edit: I tried adding a table \"bar\" to the database and thought this was the issue I had:)\n\nSteps that might reproduce:\n1. Add a table \"bar\" in the administrative UI, say, in the test database.\n2. Run `r.table('bar')` in the data explorer.  Or try `r.db('test').table('bar')`.\n\nWe get:\n\n```\nr.db('test').table('bar')\nError:\n\nYou should remove .run() from your queries when using the Data Explorer (as of RethinkDB 1.4). The query will be built and sent by the Data Explorer itself.\n```\n\nEdit:\nHowever, this happened in the same database in which #453 happened, so maybe the database has been put in a broken state.\n\nIt turns out that `r.table('foo')` also now fails with the same error message.\n\nKilling the server and restarting it doesn't fix the problem!\n"
