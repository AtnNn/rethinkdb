        "Why was an LE 32-bit int used as a length prefix instead of the usual varint? The existing tooling for protocol buffers in Java and Clojure assumes varint as a length prefix. Rectifying this would mean client breakage but would make the protocol behave more like a normal protocol buffers server and make any other existing tooling work more smoothly as well.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Explanation?"
