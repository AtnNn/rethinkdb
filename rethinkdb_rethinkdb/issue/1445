        "When thinking about #1043 and #1396, I was concerned that we aren't properly sharding across all the cores and only using the first four.  It was hard to check for this because we use ints for thread numbers and were not able to able to look for expressions that construct a `threadnum_t`.  That would be nice to have.\n\nIt would also make the code more self-documenting and reduce the chance of mixing up parameters to the code, without introducing headaches (except when you decide to _calculate_ what thread number to use, but then you _deserve_ a headache).\n"
