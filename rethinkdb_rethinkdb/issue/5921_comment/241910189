      "I completed the tests, and this is working as expected, so looks good. I did make a pair of changes in it in my branch:\r\n- updated the copyright string to reflect that we are working on it in 2016\r\n- got rid of the use of `kwargs` and the splat of that, replacing it by using the `ssl` arg directly and just setting it to `None` when appropriate. This is more readable in my opinion.\r\n\r\nSo once we are through review (CR 3738) I will merge this in from my branch (larkost/5921-asyncio-ssl-support), but credit you (@mgwilliams) for the changes in the notes."
