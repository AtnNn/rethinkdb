        "Hello... it's me again :)\r\n\r\nPer issue #1419, it would have saved me a bit of time if http://www.rethinkdb.com/faq/ mentioned that 2 GB is recommend. Specifically, I referring to the question:\r\n\r\n**What are the system requirements?**... and the answer states \r\n\r\n> ... RethinkDB doesn't have other strict requirements. It has a custom caching engine and **can run on low-memory nodes** with large amounts of on-disk data ...\r\n\r\nThe **low-memory nodes** statement made me think that 1 GB of RAM was acceptable. It may be helpful to others if you state that a minimum of 2 GB of RAM is recommended because of the table caching size.\r\n\r\nI suspect this may save some others frustration.\r\n\r\nThanks."
