      "So far I haven't seen this problem again since removing those debug yields. I'm going to revert that change in `next` for now.\r\n\r\nThe yields were meant to simulate out-of-cache conditions in debug mode. However I suspect that they behave slightly differently from actual out-of-cache conditions and violate some assumptions. I ran the fuzzer with a metadata cache size of 1 byte to check that things still work with an actually small cache, and things seem to be fine (i.e. no crashes)."
