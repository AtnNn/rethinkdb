        "Following on from #3471, it would be nice to have changefeeds where the client can send explicit acknowledgement messages to provide \"at most once\" semantics if the client wants them. This is useful for things like job queues where it's important not to give out a job more than once.\r\n\r\nThis may or may not require being able to resume changefeeds across server restarts, or from different servers. I'll leave that for when/if this makes it into reql discussion.\r\n\r\n"
