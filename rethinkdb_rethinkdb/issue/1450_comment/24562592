      "Do you have a folder named `resolve` in `/support/toolchain/node_modules/browserify/node_modules/module-deps/node_modules`?\r\n\r\nIf you delete the `support` directory, run `./configure` and run make again, I believe it should work. If it doesn't, it means that somehow npm isn't installing the package `resolve` (which is a dependency of `module-deps`"
