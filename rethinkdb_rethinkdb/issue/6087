        "Im using rethinkdb 2.3.4 , with 3 servers on replica set no sharding using a custom db (instead of the default 'test')\n\nim trying to run the following query on data explorer on a secondary index:\n\nr.db('MY_DB').table('MY_TABLE').getAll([SOME_INTEGER],{index:\"MY_IDX\"})\n\nthis query gives me an empty result, but i know this shouldnt be empty because im running to  r.db('MY_DB').table('MY_TABLE') looking the first result querying and using SOME_INTEGER as the value of MY_IDX for the first result.\n\nI've created the index using the web interface. And the table MY_TABLE have documents in the following format:\n\n{\n... some properties,\n\"MY_IDX\":SOME_INTEGER\n}\n\nWhat am i missing?\n"
