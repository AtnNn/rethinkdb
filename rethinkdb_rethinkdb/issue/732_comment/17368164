      "1. The governor scale your max CPU frequency (in order to save some battery),. In my case it was always trying to save some battery and set the max frequency to 800 Mhz.\r\n\r\n2. Google closure was somehow messing with the inheritance of CoffeeScript. \r\nWhat's strange is that I wrote a similar piece of code than in the driver and it was getting compiled without any problem (and was working). However, I couldn't have it work with the driver.\r\nI ended up overwriting the inheritance by copying, for each object, the methods from the parent's __proto__ to its own __proto__."
