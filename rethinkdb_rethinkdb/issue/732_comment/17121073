      "@neumino The line `serializer.serialize` is the main routine of the protobuf library. The large object you see is also generated by the protobuf library. As in the ruby driver (and probably the Python one), the main performance bottleneck is certainly protobuf serialization. At least in the JS driver networking is already asynchronous so there is no problem with blocking on responses.\r\n\r\nI've been wanting to replace the google closure protobuf library in the JS driver for some time but the alternatives I've experimented with don't appear to be very good either. We'll have to address this issue once we turn our attention to performance and it becomes clear that driver performance is the main bottleneck in query execution speed."
