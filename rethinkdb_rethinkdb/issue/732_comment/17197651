      "The actual wire output of both drivers should be identical. I'll check anyway to make sure but none of the \"descriptor\" information seen here will be included in the output.\r\n\r\nI actually like @neumino's hypothesis that part of the performance difference comes from no longer compiling the JS driver with `ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS`. The optimizer might remove these redundant message descriptors if they are not actually touched by the parts of the API we actually use."
