      "@wmrowan I tried with the 1.4.0-0 driver. It was as slow as our actual driver.\r\nSo the regression probably occurred with 1.4\r\n\r\n@coffeemug I could do thousands of reads before.\r\nThe query that generated the gist is a dumb get: `r.db(\"stress\").table(\"js\").get( pk_value).run(...) `\r\n\r\nWe can first try to set the flag ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS in google closure. I wouldn't be surprised if that is enough to temporary fix this problem."
