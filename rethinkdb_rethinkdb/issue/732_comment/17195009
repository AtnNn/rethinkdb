      "@neumino -- you say:\r\n\r\n> I cannot get huge workload with the javascript driver now as I used to get\r\n\r\nI don't exactly understand your numbers, but could you say what you used to get and what you get now? (As far as I understand your current script gets ~70 reads/second -- what did you get before?)\r\n\r\nAlso, where is that huge gist print coming from? What was the original query that generates this gist?\r\n\r\nI'm moving back to 1.5 because a) it's likely it's a 1.5 regression, b) I'd like to get a basic understanding of what's going on before we decide what we do with this issue."
