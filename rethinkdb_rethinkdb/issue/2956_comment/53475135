      "We have a cluster of RethinkDB servers running within a [VPC](http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) on Amazon AWS and use an [Elastic Load Balancer](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) accessible only from within that VPC to distribute the load among those servers.\r\n\r\nWe are connecting from Node.js to our ELB which distributes load to any of the RethinkDB servers and it seems to work great.\r\n\r\nOnly caveat we came across, the Web UI is a little wonky if you connect to it via a load balancer URL (I suspect because it uses websockets for some of its magic and websockets don't play nicely with ELBs)."
