      "Another option is to set up a RethinkDB proxy on the client machines.\r\nA RethinkDB proxy is like a normal RethinkDB server, except that it does not host any data itself.\r\nThe advantage of using a RethinkDB proxy is that it can route queries directly to the correct node in the cluster, since it understands what the queries are doing. The disadvantage is that you will have more CPU usage on the client machine, since the proxy will perform some parts of the query processing itself.\r\n\r\nI recommend benchmarking this with your application, because the trade-off will be different depending on your network speed, query workload and cluster configuration.\r\n\r\nTo start a RethinkDB proxy on the client:\r\n`rethinkdb proxy -j <server1host> -j <server2host> ...`\r\n\r\nThen your application can connect to the proxy on `localhost`."
