      "Alternately you can pass `0` to all of: `--cluster-port`, `--driver-port`, and `--http-port`. This will get random open ports from the OS, but does mean you need to read the ports out of the log file. We effectively have some sample code on doing this in [`test/common/driver.py`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/test/common/driver.py#L517) that watches the log file for this output. Depending on your goals this might be overkill. In case that has moved in the mean time, the function is named `read_ports_from_log`.\r\n\r\n"
