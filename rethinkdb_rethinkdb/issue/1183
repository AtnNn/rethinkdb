        "Reported on Google Groups by Ben Li -- See https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/rethinkdb/awcN58FVFQ8\n\nWhen the server is under heavy load, users get disconnected from the web interface\nThis happens when the ajax request to `/ajax` times out (10 seconds).\n\nIt has been a recurrent problem for users, especially when they are writing big queries on the data explorer.\n\nI can get a time out on newton even if some cores have a 0% load. Does the http server lies on the wrong thread?\nAt some point people could discard the warning and still play with the interface.\n\nWe could do something smarter (stop doing requests to `stats`, let people play with the web interface (with a red warning -- data not up to date - for read use only).\nAnd when the http server is up again, we probably don't need to refresh like we do now (that would require a little testing, but I don't see how that would break).\n\nSlightly related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1074\n\nI don't really know what's the expected behavior for the CLI.
