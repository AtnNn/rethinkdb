        "As discussed in #612, which is the opposite of this issue, the Ruby driver preemptively requests subsequent batches.  #612 wants the Python to driver to be like the Ruby driver, but what should actually happen is the Ruby driver should be like the Python driver.\r\n\r\nBecause requests and replies arrive in the same order, and also because of the potential size of a subsequent batch (which is sent in one monolithic message), preemptively requesting subsequent batches can hurt clients' user response times, especially in the most important aspect of performance for a lot of clients, how long a web page takes to begin displaying data for the user.\r\n\r\n"
