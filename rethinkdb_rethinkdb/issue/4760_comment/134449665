      "Do you see all results if you look at the \"Raw view\"?\r\nYou could also add a `.toJsonString()` to your query to get the full result as a string.\r\n\r\nI'm actually surprised that this is working. I was under the impression that it was not, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3912 .\r\nIt's currently useful to enforce the limit even for arrays, because rendering too many results disables syntax highlighting and makes the Data Explorer generally slow."
