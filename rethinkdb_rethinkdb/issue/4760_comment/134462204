      "@danielmewes you're right, the limits aren't being applied to arrays in 2.x at all. I was working with 1.15.x when I ran into this.\r\n\r\nThe only problems with the \"unlimited\" setting are 1) as mentioned above, that's not reasonable for most queries so you might have to change it frequently and 2) you have to remember to set it *before* executing the query, which is annoying if you already kicked off a long-running operation and just wanna copy the results out afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn the case of arrays, if (like you said) \"Raw view\" included the full results and the \"Tree view\" were still paged, I'd also be happy with that."
