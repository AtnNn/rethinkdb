        "Currently the countdown dashboard says `146 passing / 13 failing`, but I have no idea how to get to the test results. We need to add a link to the countdown app that takes us to the test results.\n\nAssigning to @atnnn, but this will require collaboration with @mglukhovsky. We should do it sooner rather than later, because otherwise the tests aren't very helpful.\n\nWe should also add a title to the dashboard that says `http://countdown.rethinkdb.com` so people know where to get to get to the link. This is in @mglukhovsky's court.\n"
