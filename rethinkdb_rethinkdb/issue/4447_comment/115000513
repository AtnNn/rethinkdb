      "@graycatfromspace I've looked at the configuration, the limits you've configured are obviously high enough.\r\n\r\nI haven't tried on Debian 8 yet. Maybe we have an incompatibility there. On Ubuntu 12.04 I can easily open 10000+ connections to a single server.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how limits.conf is parsed exactly. Have you tried replacing the `-` in your entries by `hard`? Just a guess, I suspect that's not it but maybe worth a try?"
