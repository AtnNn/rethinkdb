      "(for anyone looking into this: if this is an incompatiblity with Debian 8, the place to look at is the function `run_generic_global_startup_behavior()` in `utils.cc`. That's where we set the soft file descriptor limit to be equal to the hard limit. If somehow reading the hard limit was giving us a wrong value, then that could cause us to set a wrong soft limit as well.)"
