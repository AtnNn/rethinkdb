      "My earlier statement is false. By tracking `on_open` we can, but still, it would be better I'd think to provide an error of some sort when handlers get closed abruptly.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's unclear from https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/ruby/lib/net.rb#L253  what the on_close() would mean without a corresponding on_open or on_error."
