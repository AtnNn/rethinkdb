        "\"rethinkdb -d /empty/dir\" fails with error messages\n\nwith error message:\nerror: Inaccessible database file: \"/the/empty/dir/metadata\": No such file or directory\n       Some possible reasons:\n       - the database file couldn't be created or opened for reading and writing\n       - the user which was used to start the database is not an owner of the file\n\nSimilarly \"rethinkdb create -d /empty/dir\" also fails because creating an db on an existing directory is forbidden.\n\nHowever I think these actions should be allowed. What I think users will normally do is to create an empty dir, and then let DB initialize it. (What I am doing all the time with mysql, mongo, etc)\n\nThis commit tries to ensure this behavior: Detect whether 'metadata' is in the directory, consider the directory is not initialized as a rethinkdb instance if 'metadata' does not exist, and then start to initialize it if needed.\n"
