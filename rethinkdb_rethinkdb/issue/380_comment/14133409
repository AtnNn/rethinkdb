      "So it looks like it has been acknowledged as a bug, but well, we don't know when it will be fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n@coffeemug should we push a fix for the time being?\r\n```\r\n@$('#container').html @template\r\n    key: value\r\n```\r\nWould become\r\n```\r\n@$('#container').html @template(\r\n    key: value)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`herbySk` just fixed it with some sed commands. See https://gist.github.com/herby/5041082\r\nIt works because we don' t have things like a(b)(c) in our code.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt can also be fixed by @atnnn by precompiling web assets."
