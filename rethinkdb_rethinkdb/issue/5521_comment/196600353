      "It looks like it is interpreting the result of the `r.http` call as a string rather than a JSON object - looking at the HTTP response, it isn't setting the Content-Type, so `r.http` does not try to convert it to anything.  You can specify the result type of the query by using `r.http(..., result_format='json')`."
