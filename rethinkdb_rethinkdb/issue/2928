        "I've experienced this problem 3 times now, so it's not just a one off. I'm running rethinkdb on a rather low spec server (1GB RAM with 3GB swap, 2.0GHz single core processor).\r\n\r\nWhen a large amount of data is written to rethinkdb, rethinkdb crashes and refuses to start up again with the following error; \r\n`Guarantee failed: [state_ != state_in_use || extent_use_refcount == 0]`\r\nand\r\n`backtrace_t::backtrace_t() at 0x884cf7d (/usr/bin/rethinkdb)\\n2: format_backtrace(bool) at 0x884d2f8 (/usr/bin/rethinkdb)\\n14: coro_t::run() at 0x886decd (/usr/bin/rethinkdb)`\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced by getting a table with 3 million entires, and telling rethinkdb to create an index for one of the rows.\r\n\r\nThe only way I've found to fix the problem is to delete the entire database and instance, then start again."
