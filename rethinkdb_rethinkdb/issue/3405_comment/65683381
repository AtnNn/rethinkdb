      "Hi @Gitart \r\nRethinkDB's number type follows double precision IEEE 754 floating point semantics.\r\nYou can store all integers between -2^53 and 2^53 (9,007,199,254,740,992) precisely. Bigger and smaller integers might get rounded, as in your case.\r\n\r\nYou can work around this by storing your numbers as strings, though that will affect their ordering (unless you pad them all to the same length with 0), and limits the operations you can perform on them in ReQL.\r\n\r\nI've opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3407 to track a possible addition of a big number type to ReQL. This is a fairly low priority at the moment though."
