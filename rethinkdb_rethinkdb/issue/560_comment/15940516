      "@ricardobeat I don't really want different names for the same operation. I would be fine having `.has_value()` for both array and objects.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I am not a big fan of `.has()` is just like @mlucy and @jdoliner said, `.has()` could stand for `has_key()` or `has_value()`. Even if the doc is clear, it's still a little less clear (without doc) what `has()` is doing."
