      "Hmm this looks like it may be a bad example. Contains is used for checking\r\nif an object contains a certain attribute. However I would expect the\r\n\"name\" attribute of the show object to just be a string and calling\r\ncontains on that should error (as this one does). Would you mind just\r\nrunning 'r.db('test').table('tv_shows')' and see what you get?\r\n\r\nAlso where is this example located? I think we'll have to change it.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, March 31, 2013, Richard Hurt wrote:\r\n\r\n> Using the sample 'tv_shows' table, I'm trying to find all the shows with\r\n> the word \"star\" in them.
