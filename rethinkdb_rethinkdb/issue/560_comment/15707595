      "This has burned so many people over time and is so confusing, I think we absolutely need to change the name of `contains` (`has_attr` works for me, but other things will work well too). This is especially important in the context of #211. Also, #420 is relevant (and is possible a dup). I'm moving this to `1.5-reql-arrays` milestone as a reminder that `contains` is a really bad name for this operation.\r\n\r\n@rnhurt -- hope this makes sense, and thank you for reporting this! There is currently no operation for checking if something is a substring, but we'll add that as part of #264 and #213. In the meantime, please use the workaround suggested by @al3xandru: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/560#issuecomment-15694321.\r\n"
