      "If you go the `has_key|field|attr` route, please make it camelCase `hasKey` on the js driver.\r\n\r\nI don't think `.has()` is ambiguous at all. The confusion in `contains` comes from the idea that a string/array can also \"contain\" something, but `someString.has('xxx')` would be totally uncommon."
