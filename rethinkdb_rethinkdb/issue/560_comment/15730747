      "The (small) issue I have with `has_attr` is that it's introducing a new term: `attr`. What's an `attr`? In many places we refer to data in tables as rows. These have fields. In other places we talk refer to data as documents. These have fields or keys. Following the logic around these concepts, the name should be `has_field` or `has_key`. I'd prefer `has_field`."
