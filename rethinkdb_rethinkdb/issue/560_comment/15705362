      "Ohh, I see. @rnhurt, hopefully these will clarify things a bit:\r\n\r\n1. for the Data Explorer example the doc reads: \"select all documents where the abilities field contains a **key** called 'super-strength'. While I agree that it could be a bit more clear, what it means is that the 'abilities' field is an embedded sub-document and the `contains` function looks if this embedded sub-document has an attribute `super-strength`.\r\n\r\n2. in your example, you are looking if an attribute (with most probably) a string value contains a sub-string. For that case, the example I've provided will do it.\r\n\r\nHope this will clarify a bit these two separate scenarios (and sorry for the late reply). If you feel the docs should be clearer, please let me know how do you think we should improve them. "
