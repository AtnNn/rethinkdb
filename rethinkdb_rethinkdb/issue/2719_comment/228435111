      "A workaround for this is to use `distinct` which emits the group values lazily and still allows the reductions to be performed across all shards. This is much faster than native `group` in every case I've tried:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table('test')\r\n  .distinct({ index: 'date' })\r\n  .map({\r\n    group: r.row,\r\n    reduction: r.table('test').getAll(r.row, { index: 'date' }).count()\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\n@danielmewes noted the only difference between this rewrite and `.group(...)` is that the distinct can result in empty groups if a document is modified while the query is being run."
