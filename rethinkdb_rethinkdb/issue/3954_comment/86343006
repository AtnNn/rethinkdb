      "To be clearer, it hangs in `SocketWrapper.recvall` when the Python code is expecting a very large read, and gets about \190 of the way through it in two reads and then hangs indefinitely.  The size is a bit odd (code is saying \"saw chunk of size 212044\" and then \"saw chunk of size 49440\" which does not add to any TCP buffer size I know of), but it appears to require multiple sends on the server side, and the server simply isn't sending the remaining data."
