      "Just looked into this out of curiosity, and it looks like the server is waiting while part-way through writing a large response to the client (~400KB).  There may be a bug in Tornado's `BaseIOStream.read_bytes`, I doubt this is a problem with the server.  Might try different methods of reading in `TornadoConnection._reader`."
