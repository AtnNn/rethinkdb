      "Err, sorry this was a late night post. Dont use the update command, use the\r\nreplace command instead (update automatically merges documents, which is\r\nwhy it doesnt do what you expect). Im on an ipad, will give a more clear\r\nexplanation today when i get to a computer, unless someone else gets to\r\nthis first.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@jdoliner edited this just to remove the email reply cruft so it's a bit more readable."
