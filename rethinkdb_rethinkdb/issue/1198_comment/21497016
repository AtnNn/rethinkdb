      "Hi @altunyurt. Basically `update` can only be used to add fields or modify existing fields in the document. It can't be used to remove them. If update is passed an object `a` the each field present in `a` gets copied into to the end result. However fields not present in `a` but present in the original document also wind up in the end result. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"foo\" : 1, \"bar\" : 2}.update({}) -> {\"foo\" : 1, \"bar\" : 2}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs @coffeemug mentioned `replace` is the command that doesn't do this. It just takes exactly what you pass to the replace function and overwrites the document with that value."
