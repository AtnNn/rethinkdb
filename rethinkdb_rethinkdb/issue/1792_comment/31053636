      "Ok, this is problematic. I'll talk to @Tryneus about a workaround for name conflicts when he comes back after the holidays. We'll get a workaround for you until we design a proper admin API in the drivers.\r\n\r\n> That's actually a pretty good idea, but it seems you also need to be able to identify datacentres/clusters as Replicas\r\n\r\nYep, I hand-waved that away, but the full API would of course support that.\r\n\r\n> You put '5' replicas - which would seem excessive.\r\n\r\nSorry, that was a random number."
