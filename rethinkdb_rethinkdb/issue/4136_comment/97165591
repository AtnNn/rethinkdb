      "Hmm actually looking at the API documentation for `distinct` http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/distinct/ I'm now unsure if my explanation was correct. It suggests that `distinct` even without an index *does* return a stream. I'm not sure if the API docs or my memory are wrong (technically there shouldn't be a reason for why it cannot return a stream).\r\nInvestigating now... (@mlucy?)"
