      "Hi @digi604, the reason that the limit isn't applied early enough is that `distinct()` - the way it's currently implemented - works by leading all rows first, then sorting them, and then filtering duplicates.\r\nSo the full result of `distinct` is computed first, and only then is the `limit` applied.\r\n\r\nIf you can use an index for distinguishing distinct rows, you can pass that index to `distinct` and it should work as expected.\r\n\r\nA more general question/comment:\r\nIs this the full query? The `distinct` here won't really do anything because every row will be distinct (at least their primary key will be different). You might want to add a `without('id')` before the `distinct` to only compare the remaining document fields. Or you can use an index over the property that you want to make distinct as mentioned before."
