      "Ok both the API docs and my memory is correct, I just read the docs wrong. They say that `distinct` without an index returns a stream when applied to a table directly (is there any use in doing that?).\r\nHowever when applied to a selection, that falls in the `sequence` overload and that results in an array (i.e. it will load the whole result into memory first)."
