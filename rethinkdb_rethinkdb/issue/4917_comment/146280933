      "@danielmewes I am not sure which exact queries because we have a lot of queries and the error logs were filled with errors that happened after the crash. I will take a look into it later today, but for now I need to roll back all of our servers. But it seems like even servers that are replicas (not primary) crashes. So some sort of read. Also worth to re-iterate that this only happens on ubuntu."
