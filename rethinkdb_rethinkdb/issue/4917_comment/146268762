      "I do am experiencing this throughout after upgraded to 2.1.5. I'm running on Ubuntu. However, the server that is running Debian seems to be fine. Where would I get the full stack trace?\r\n\r\nWe had to shutdown all the ubuntu servers because it is completely unstable and the servers would not stay running for more than 5minutes. We will rollback to 2.1.4."
