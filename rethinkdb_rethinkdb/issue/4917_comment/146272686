      "@mshi do you know the query that triggers this in your case? Which version of Ubuntu are you on?\r\n\r\nLike mentioned above, I recommend downgrading back to 2.1.4 until we've resolved this. We've removed 2.1.5 from our Ubuntu repository, so if you do a `sudo apt-get update` and then re-install RethinkDB, it should automatically pick up 2.1.4 again."
