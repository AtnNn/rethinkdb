      "@jorrit Thanks for the report. For now I recommend downgrading back to 2.1.4.\r\n\r\nCould you post the full backtrace please? (the one above didn't include addresses, which should now be visible)\r\n\r\nA core file would be awesome. Can you email me to daniel@rethinkdb.com please? I will send you instructions on where you can upload the file.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this bug actually appears to be very common, I've decided to take out the 2.1.5 release from our repositories again until we can resolve this. Sorry for the inconvenience.\r\nFor everyone affected by this, I recommend downgrading back to 2.1.4."
