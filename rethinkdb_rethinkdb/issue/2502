        "I know you guys are busy finalizing the 1.13 release, but let me ask one more: Python 3 support.\r\n\r\nThe lack of the Python 3 compatibility has been a major blocker for me to adopt RethinkDB in my projects for more than half a year. I even considered converting my existing Python 3 codebase into the Python 2 one, but it would be really painful.\r\n\r\nWould you guys mind investing a few more days to make the Python driver compatible to Python 3? Though I have no knowledge on the internals of the Python driver, but considering the dependency on protobuf has gone, I guess the transition would not take for too long. Of course I may wait until the Python 3 support is introduced in the upcoming 1.14 release or even 1.15 of the future, but I really want to use your product **now**.\r\n\r\nSorry for my repeating the words that was already answered on IRC, but this issue has a huge impact on me. I believe many (at least, a reasonable number of) users will also be happy to see the Python 3 support.\r\n\r\nI hope there's something that I can help to get the compatibility, though I'm doubtful that the quality of my code can meet the guidelines you require."
