      "> Also I think maybe the stuff in sam_2156 is a bit in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nOkay.  Specifically, because of the way concatmap operations can get expanded, it seems like we often might find ourselves parallelizing in the wrong place.  I thought we could just say \"let's parallelize these few operations specifically\" and maybe that would turn out okay.  Maybe it would.  But maybe a different design of e.g. returning promises as @mlucy suggested to me or some other restructuring would be a better idea for query evaluation."
