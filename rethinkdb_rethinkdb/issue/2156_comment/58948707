      "It was taking a lot of time to implement, and my implementation direction was going down the wrong path, and there are other more familiar with the query language code that can also work on it, which is why I stopped.\r\n\r\nI think it's pretty easy to find criteria for what to parallelize -- run calls that operate remotely, but not recursively remotely, simultaneously.  As for how much it can be parallelized, ideally that would be figured out dynamically."
