      "As a first step (and to get this moving again) I suggest we make union streams evaluate their inputs in parallel. This would solve the issue for both @dminkovsky's and @wojons' use cases and also make https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2340 very easy to implement.\r\n\r\nWe can later look into parallelizing other operations, whenever their non-parallelism actually becomes an issue."
