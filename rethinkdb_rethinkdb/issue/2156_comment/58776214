      "@danielmewes @srh been wanting to know what makes this one hard to do. maybe it is when there are nested writes or something i can see that being hard but maybe using no atomic flag could be a work around but for reads couldnt opening just a few cortuines do the trick and then merging them at the lat step or something. Not having this feature makes it hard to work over larger time spans."
