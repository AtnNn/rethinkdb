      "I'm putting this on the backburner because Slava has been hinting that I should work on the constant time count issue (edit: or... never mind).  Also we have more query language people now, and not many buffer cache people...\r\n\r\nAlso I think maybe the stuff in sam_2156 is a bit in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nI'm going to strip out some of the positive changes in that branch (either misc. cleanup or some positive-value tweaks) and get them in next."
