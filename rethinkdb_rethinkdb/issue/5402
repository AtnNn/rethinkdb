        "I noticed this behavior installing our package [BigchainDB](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb) an AWS instance with Ubuntu 14.04. Our package installs a couple of shell scripts, and they both fail to run because of a `VersionConflict` exception. If you need, our [`setup.py` is available in our repo](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/blob/develop/setup.py) as well as the issue https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/41.\n\nThis issue affects all the packages where:\n- the value of [`rethinkdb.version.version`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/version.py) is different than the value of `Version` in `PKG-INFO` in the [source distribution](https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/r/rethinkdb/rethinkdb-2.2.0.post3.tar.gz), and\n- the system is using the default version of `setuptools` shipped with Ubuntu 14.04 (that is, `setuptools==3.3`). The last version of `setuptools` works properly, but I think the problem is on how the driver is packaged on your side.\n## Steps to reproduce the exception (with docker)\n### Get a shell in ubuntu 14.04\n\n``` sh\ndocker run --rm -it ubuntu:14.04\n```\n### Once you are inside the container\n\n``` sh\napt-get install python3-setuptools -y\neasy_install3 pip\npip install rethinkdb==2.2.0.post3\npython3\n```\n### Once you are in the interpreter\n\n``` python\n>>> import pkg_resources as p\n>>> ws = p.WorkingSet()\n>>> ws.resolve([p.Requirement.parse('rethinkdb==2.2.0.post3')])\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 632, in resolve\n    raise VersionConflict(dist,req) # XXX put more info here\npkg_resources.VersionConflict: (rethinkdb 2.2.0-3 (/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages), Requirement.parse('rethinkdb==2.2.0.post3'))\n```\n## But, it works in this case\n\nIn the container, try to install an alternative version of the driver\n\n``` sh\npip install rethinkdb==2.1.0\n```\n### Once you are in the interpreter\n\n``` python\n>>> import pkg_resources as r\n>>> \n>>> ws = r.WorkingSet()\n>>> \n>>> ws.resolve([r.Requirement.parse('rethinkdb==2.1.0')])\n[rethinkdb 2.1.0 (/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages)]    # <-- yee, no exception!\n```\n## Conclusion\n\nI think that the problem is when the package name ends with `postX`, like `rethinkdb 2.2.0.post3`, `rethinkdb 2.2.0.post2`, `rethinkdb 2.2.0.post1` and on. I inspected the packages in [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rethinkdb) and there is a discrepancy between the version in the `rethinkdb.version` package and the version contained in `PKG-INFO`.\n"
