        "I noticed this behavior installing our package [BigchainDB](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb) an AWS instance with Ubuntu 14.04. Our package installs a couple of shell scripts, and they both fail to run because of a `VersionConflict` exception. If you need, our [`setup.py` is available in our repo](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/blob/develop/setup.py) as well as the issue https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/41.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects all the packages where:\r\n - the value of [`rethinkdb.version.version`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/version.py) is different than the value of `Version` in `PKG-INFO` in the [source distribution](https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/r/rethinkdb/rethinkdb-2.2.0.post3.tar.gz), and\r\n - the system is using the default version of `setuptools` shipped with Ubuntu 14.04 (that is, `setuptools==3.3`). The last version of `setuptools` works properly, but I think the problem is on how the driver is packaged on your side.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the exception (with docker)\r\n### Get a shell in ubuntu 14.04\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ndocker run --rm -it ubuntu:14.04\r\n```\r\n### Once you are inside the container\r\n```sh\r\napt-get install python3-setuptools -y\r\neasy_install3 pip\r\npip install rethinkdb==2.2.0.post3\r\npython3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Once you are in the interpreter\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pkg_resources as p\r\n>>> ws = p.WorkingSet()\r\n>>> ws.resolve([p.Requirement.parse('rethinkdb==2.2.0.post3')])\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 632, in resolve\r\n    raise VersionConflict(dist,req) # XXX put more info here\r\npkg_resources.VersionConflict: (rethinkdb 2.2.0-3 (/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages), Requirement.parse('rethinkdb==2.2.0.post3'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## But, it works in this case\r\nIn the container, try to install an alternative version of the driver\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npip install rethinkdb==2.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Once you are in the interpreter\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pkg_resources as r\r\n>>> \r\n>>> ws = r.WorkingSet()\r\n>>> \r\n>>> ws.resolve([r.Requirement.parse('rethinkdb==2.1.0')])\r\n[rethinkdb 2.1.0 (/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages)]    # <-- yee, no exception!\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nI think that the problem is when the package name ends with `postX`, like `rethinkdb 2.2.0.post3`, `rethinkdb 2.2.0.post2`, `rethinkdb 2.2.0.post1` and on. I inspected the packages in [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rethinkdb) and there is a discrepancy between the version in the `rethinkdb.version` package and the version contained in `PKG-INFO`."
