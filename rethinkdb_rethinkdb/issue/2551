        "`store_t::update_metainfo()` is very severely inefficient. Is has complexity O(n^2) in the size of the metainfo, which contains one entry per shard.\n\nWe call this function once for every write. In practice it takes 1-5 ms depending on the number of shards.\n\nAnother serious problem, especially in combination, is that old range entries don't seem to be cleaned up. If I reshard a table multiple times, more and more entries seem to accumulate in the region_map.\n\nPossibly a cause for #2539\n"
