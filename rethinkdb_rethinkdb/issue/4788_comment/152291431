      "As far as I know, we couldn't reproduce this again.\r\nIt seems plausible that this was a consequence of very quickly starting and stopping a server, which might have synchronized some parts of the metadata to the other servers but not other parts before getting shut down again.\r\n\r\nI suspect that fixing this completely is more work than what it's worth. Closing as `wontfix` under the assumption that the problem is rare. If this occurs again, we can re-open the issue."
