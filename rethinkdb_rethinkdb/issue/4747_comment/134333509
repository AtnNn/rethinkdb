      "After talking to @mbroadst on IRC, it looks like the tables aren't visible because their database is missing. They show up in `r.db('rethinkdb').table('table_config')` with `{db: '__deleted_database__'}`,\r\n\r\nWe're not sure what causes the tables to get into that state yet.\r\nThe obvious suspect would be https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4465 , but we think that this operation doesn't happen in @mbroadst's tests."
