      "Our next release will introduce an `r.floor` and related functions, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/866 for more information on those.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime you can use `.seconds().info()(\"value\").split(\".\")(0).coerceTo(\"NUMBER\")` which essentially takes the string representation, splits it at the dot, and coerces the leading part back to a number. It's not pretty but should help you bridge the time until that next release.\r\n\r\nHope that helps. I'm closing this since it's not a bug, but feel free to ask any more questions here and we'll answer them for you."
