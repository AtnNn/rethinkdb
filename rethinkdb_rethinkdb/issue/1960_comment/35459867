      "Agreed with @neumino: we should ship with a Python driver with a hard-coded version that is guaranteed to work with `import` and `export`. Having commands you can run from the binary rely on an external version and packaging system is really shoddy, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nIt would be wonderful to come up with a clever scheme for migrating from one LTS version to another. One idea would be to ship previous LTS releases in a container (or a VM), or download older versions of RethinkDB from an archive, so the `export / import` process is streamlined.\r\n\r\nOther clever proposals are welcome."
