      "I'm a fan of \"Don't make any global decisions, and instead make the decision on case by case basis.\"\r\nDifferent cases come with very different trade-offs between our costs for maintaining compatibility (which are ultimately also our users' costs, since we are going to ship more slowly), and our users' costs for keeping up with the changes. Both aspects should be carefully weighted against each other on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nGuarantees about compatibility are nice for users, but in practice cannot always be kept, which makes their value rather questionable.\r\nStable versions of Ubuntu are supposed to maintain full compatibility within that version. This worked well for a while, but then it turned out that backporting security updates to really old versions of Firefox was more work than is practicable. So Firefox is now kept in sync with the upstream versions, and breaks compatibility all the time.\r\nWhat if we find out that there's a fundamental flaw in our disk layout that leads to data corruption (an extreme example that will hopefully never come true, but who knows)? We couldn't possibly maintain compatibility then, even within an LTS release.\r\n\r\nOf course we can still give \"best effort\" promises to users. We should give these promises for the LTS versions obviously. I don't think we should make any general commitments for non-LTS versions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso @atnnn's writeup of different types of changes and their impacts is awesome! :+1: "
