      "@atnnn it's not really related to #1010.\r\n\r\nWhen someone install RethinkDB, it doesn't come with `rethinkdb import/export`. They have to install the python driver to have `import/export`.\r\nI would be in favor of including the python driver in the Ubuntu package with the C++ backend. I think it's possible. We just need to say that RethinkDB depends on `libprotobuf-dev` right? (I'm not super familiar with launchpad, so I may be totally wrong).\r\n\r\nI also agree with @atnnn on keeping old-client-new-server compatibility. I often update RethinkDB without updating my driver. We are using protobuf, so we can just add terms.\r\nIn the case of gmr, if it's just adding a \"hack\" in the driver, I would be totally cool with that.\r\nIt can log some message, and in 1.13, we remove the `grouped_map_reduce`/`group_by` command.\r\n\r\nKeeping compatibility for `import/export` is a must. No sane person find cool to downgrade a package with pip.\r\n\r\nWe also don't tell driver developers the change for the next version, and we should. It seems fair to tell them before releasing and not after."
