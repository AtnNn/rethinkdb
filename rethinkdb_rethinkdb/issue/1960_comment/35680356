      "If we support old clients with new servers, we're going to spend a lot of time writing extra tests, doing unnecessary maintenance, doing unnecessary implementation work, and answering user questions about deprecated features.  Every hour we spend doing that is an hour we aren't spending on the LTS release.\r\n\r\nI agree that upgrading RethinkDB is a pain in the ass right now, but I think that the best way to solve that is to get to the LTS release as fast as possible so that it isn't an issue for people running us in production."
