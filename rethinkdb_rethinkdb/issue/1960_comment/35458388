      "I think it's fine to break compatibility before the LTS if it requires some work to keep it (half a day of work is fine).\r\n\r\nSo \r\n- #1890 -- don't break compatibility since it's not more work\r\n- #1959 -- It's @mlucy's call but I guess it's a decent amount of work, so I'm fine breaking things.\r\n- #1010 -- that's a tricky one. It's somehow ok to break format, but a few things are bad now that we can improve:\r\n    - Ship the python driver with RethinkDB that only RethinkDB can use -- that should be doable for Ubuntu, @atnnn could you confirm?\r\n    - Write how to use install an old version of the driver/rethinkdb -- I don't expect people to know how to downgrade a package.\r\n\r\nIt's also a case by case thing I guess. Breaking the syntax for `r.table(\"foo\")` is really bad since it would break the export/import.\r\n"
