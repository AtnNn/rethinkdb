        "S2 has a function `MayIntersect` which we might be able to use instead of the exact (but more expensive) `Intersects` test for the geospatial index traversal:\r\n```C++\r\n// If this method returns false, the region does not intersect the given\r\n// cell.  Otherwise, either region intersects the cell, or the intersection\r\n// relationship could not be determined.\r\nvirtual bool MayIntersect(S2Cell const& cell) const = 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `MayIntersect` might be faster or slower overall, depending on the data. If it returns false positives too often, we will traverse larger portions of the btree unnecessarily."
