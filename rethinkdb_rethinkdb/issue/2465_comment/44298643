      "1 thank you first, \r\n2 where the stream data store? DB get the whole result and write them to disk(memory cant hold them)? and if the cursor move forward, and read the result from disk and then response to client?\r\n3 and what about the middle data? for example, i do a join two big tables where t1.no == t2.number, so the middle data is all rows of t1 and t2(we must read all of them so we can get the join result), and suppose each server of cluster cant hold the middle data, how the RethinkDB store the middle data? \r\n4 thank you :)"
