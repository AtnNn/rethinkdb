      "To clarify, by \"test\" I mean a method beginning with `test_`. If there are assertions about the state of a table, ideally all changes and assertions about those changes would be in the same test. I didn't add, remove, or move any assertions (except combining the tests in `test_det.rb` into a single method). Hopefully this means none of the intended constraints have changed. \r\n\r\nTests went from ~20s to ~50s for me. However, I think this could be improved since most of the tests use one table - the other table is only used a few times. I can take a look into this if you want.\r\n\r\nThe spacing of curly braces looks pretty typical to me, but it was done using an automated tool so it might be a little pedantic."
