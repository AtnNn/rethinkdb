      "Unfortunately there weren't assertions for many of the constraints.  For example, if test A ran before test B, we would implicitly assert that test A left the table with element X still in it at the end by assuming X was there in test B.  This was, admittedly, terrible -- you're right that all the constraints for one test should be enforced in that test.  I don't think losing a few implicit persistence constraints is a reason not to merge this in though; I'll go through and add them explicitly to the tests when I'm done with the protobuf refactoring.\r\n\r\nIf you could get the time the tests take to run down a bit that would be great.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug -- did @presidentbeef sign a contributor agreement yet?  (Also, is there a list somewhere of people who have?)  I'd like to merge this in relatively soon."
