      "First off, thanks for doing this @presidentbeef!  The tests were a real mess.\r\n\r\nI'm a little hesitant about resetting the tables between tests, though, for three reasons:\r\n* Some of the current tests implicitly enforce the invariant that parts of the table are the same after the test was run -- i.e. that some things *didn't* change, or were at least reset.  (If this invariant was violated, subsequent tests would fail.)  This was admittedly messy, but we'll have to go back and explicitly enforce these constraints to make sure we have the same test coverage.  Did you already do that, or do we still need to figure out what was being implicitly enforced?\r\n* Speed is a primary concern here, because I frequently re-run these tests after even minor changes while developing (sometimes dozens of times an hour if I'm making a sequence of small changes).  How much of a slowdown are you seeing?\r\n\r\n(Also, for my own edification, is that brace style standard for Ruby?  I don't have that much experience with the language, but it looks like a lot of whitespace.)"
