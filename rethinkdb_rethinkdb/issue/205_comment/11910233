      "Realized the two tables were the same, doh. This is still about twice as slow. With Ruby 1.9.3, the \"next\" branch takes ~16s, with these changes it's about ~30s. Not great, but obviously there is overhead from clearing out the table for each test. Maybe there's a faster method for reseting the table?"
