      "Erroring seems safer in this case because most other ISO 8601 parsers (e.g. Ruby's) treat ISO 8601 date-times without time zones as being in the local time zone, which we don't have access to.  (Etienne also confirms that this is what he would expect.)  Erroring seems safer than having nonstandard default behavior.\r\n\r\n(Also, I just realized that driver changes *are* required to support the new optarg, but they'll be minimal.)\r\n\r\n@srh -- sure, `default_timezone` it is."
