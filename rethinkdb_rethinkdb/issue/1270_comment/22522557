      "Alright, here's what we're going to do:\r\n* No more times without time zones.\r\n* `r.now` and `r.epoch_time` produce UTC times.\r\n* `r.time` requires a timezone to be specified.\r\n* `r.iso8601` will error if you pass an ISO 8601 string without a time zone, but will have an optarg `tz` that lets you provide a time zone in this case.\r\n\r\nI'll implement this today, and hopefully we can freeze the server tonight.  No driver changes are required.\r\n"
