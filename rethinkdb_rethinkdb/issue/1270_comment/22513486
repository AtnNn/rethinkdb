      "Maybe: Have everything that currently defaults to \"no time zone\" default to \"UTC\", with the added change:\r\n\r\n`r.time(...)` requires a time zone parameter.\r\n`r.utc(...)` has no time zone parameter.\r\n\r\nAlso:  What if we encounter a user-constructed document with `$reql_type$` set to `'time'` that is missing the timezone field?  (Or for that matter, the epoch_time field?)  We already handle that sort of thing appropriately, right?"
