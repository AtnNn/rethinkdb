        "From `./test/run` we have the `ql` tests, that just running a subset of the `./test/rql_test/test-runner` tests, specifically:\r\n- `connections/connection.js`, `connections/promise.js`, and `connections/cursor.js`\r\n- `connections/connection.py` and `connections/cursor.py`\r\n- `connections/connection.rb`\r\n- all of the `polyglot` tests as a single test per language\r\n\r\nThere are a few problems with this approach:\r\n- there are a lot more `polyglot` tests then when this was devised, so timeouts on those tests are not uncommon\r\n- we are missing the rest of the `connections` tests\r\n- the error output through `./test/run` only outputs `stderr` to the console making quick troubleshooting difficult\r\n- since all of the `polyglot` tests for a language are grouped together a single error is reported in a not-easy-to-decipher format\r\n\r\nMy opinion on this is that we should just remove the `ql` tests from `./test/run` as it seems that people are using `./test/rql_test/test-runner` enough that we are covered there. Alternately I should run all of the `connections` tests for each language as a single group, so we pick them all up.\r\n\r\nLonger term this will be moot when we merge these two testing systems (#3442)."
