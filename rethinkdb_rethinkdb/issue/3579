        "We never implemented a `return_initial` optarg.  Currently point changefeeds and limit changefeeds always do `return_initial`, and other feeds never do.  I think that's probably the desired default behavior.\n\nIt would be too much work to support `return_initial` on range changefeeds before the release, but we could offer the option to disable it on changefeeds where it's enabled by default.  @coffeemug, @danielmewes, do you think this is worth doing?\n"
