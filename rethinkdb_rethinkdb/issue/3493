        "Since consistency monitor was moot (the issue can no longer happen) we're adding a secondary index monitor to take its place in the dashboard.\n\nPer @danielmewes:\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n```\n  o Indexes\n  <n> issues detected\n  <n> indexes under construction\n```\n\nOr alternatively:\n\n```\n  o Indexes\n  <n> issues detected\n  <N-n>/<N> indexes up to date\n```\n\nThe second variant is definitely better, but requires running `indexStatus()` on each table to collect the total number of indexes (N) that exist. This could become expensive, but we have to test it.\nFor the first variant it's sufficient to filter index post construction jobs from the `jobs` table, which should be faster.\n"
