      "Just for the record.\r\n\r\nThe bug is because we use {../id} in a template. And when we pre-process the templates with a recent version of handlebars, the output is not the one expected by our runtime library (1.0.0.beta6).\r\n\r\nWe are going to fix this by providing the appropriate handlebars binary to pre-process the templates (once we'll have upgrade the runtime library to a decent version too)."
