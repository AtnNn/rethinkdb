      "@skizzerz -- thank you so much for reporting this. We're aware of the memory hunger issues and are working hard to resolve them. Unfortunately it's a combination of different factors, and it will take some time to address. Some issues we've just fixed and are about to release (see #597), and we're working on profiling some others (see #505). Because there are a number of different issues involved, I can't give a precise ETA on this, but I can promise that this will be alleviated issue by issue over the coming days and weeks, until it seizes to be a problem completely.\r\n\r\nI'm moving this issue into 1.4.x milestone, we'll close it together with #505 when we resolve both. (Assigning to @wmrowan since he's working on profiling this right now). I'd prefer to keep them both open in case there is something different going on here, but if someone is opposed to keeping both open, merging them is cool too.\r\n\r\nAs for lack of logs when the RethinkDB process died, it's probably because the kernel's OOM killer sniped the process. When that happens, there is no opportunity for the process to log anything.\r\n\r\nI'm really sorry you're running into this. We'll fix it asap, but unfortunately the only viable solution right now is to add more RAM :("
