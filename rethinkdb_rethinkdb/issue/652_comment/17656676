      "Great news, the fix for #672 has an added benefit of cutting memory usage by a factor of 2-3 depending on the query! This is in next and will be a part of the 1.5 release that should be available next week. I'm sorry this took so long!\r\n\r\n(We can still do a lot of memory optimization, but we're going to open separate issues for dealing with specific problems as they arise)"
