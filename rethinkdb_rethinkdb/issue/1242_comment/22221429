      "The only controversial bit here for me is doing the `to_json` overload. I think it's weird because it will change the behavior of the date class for the entire system. We could subclass a date class and do it there, but that has a mildly bad smell for some reason. I think it might suck less if we didn't do this at all, but I'm not sure."
