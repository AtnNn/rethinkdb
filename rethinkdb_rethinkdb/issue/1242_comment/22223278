      "I like @mlucy's rendition of our discussion more. Specifically, the default option would be native date (which would lose precision in some languages), and the conversion to everything other than native date would happen on the server.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I like the former is that 99% of the time that's what people would want, so I think it's silly to pick a default that doesn't lose precision given that that's what people will do all the time anyway.\r\n\r\nThe reason I like the latter is that it makes driver implementation for community-supported drivers much easier."
