      "@mlucy, @coffeemug reminded me of the question about overloading `toJSON`. In my mind that was part of the solution in which we subclass the local datetime type. With the settled on solution I don't think it's necessary or advisable. To get a result that can be serialized to JSON properly, users should pass `time_format='raw'`. We need to remember to document this properly."
