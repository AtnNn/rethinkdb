      "I really like this proposal. A few comments:\r\n\r\n* Here's a complete spec for the the actual formats in `use_time_format` and in the run flag:\r\n  * `native` -- automatically convert to the native `datetime` type of the driver language\r\n  * `raw` -- automatically convert to the raw json object as understood by RethinkDB\r\n  * `iso_8601` -- automatically convert to the ISO 8601 string\r\n  * `epoch` -- automatically convert to milliseconds since epoch\r\n* As far as conversions go, we'd presumably do it on the server, correct?\r\n* In Python we can't overload `to_json` (I think), so we have to automatically register the type with the `json` library and provide our own implementation. (I think it's pretty obvious, but adding this comment for completion)\r\n\r\nAs for \"this sucks but everything else sucks more\", I actually think this solution is pretty good (i.e. I wouldn't say it sucks).\r\n\r\nI don't like the `r.use_time_format('native').table('foo').run()` proposal. It's pretty unidiomatic of ReQL, I think it should just be a flag to run.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it'd be cool to dump the global setting and just support a flag on run. We can add a global setting later if need be, but if I had to guess, I'd guess that we won't have to."
