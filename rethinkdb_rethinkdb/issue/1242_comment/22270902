      "We don't need to use a third party library to support timezones in the python driver. We can create a very simple instance of the tzinfo base class that wraps the offset information we already provide.\r\n\r\nWe're stuck on the JS side though. No timezone support. It's either local (as defined by your client machine) or UTC."
