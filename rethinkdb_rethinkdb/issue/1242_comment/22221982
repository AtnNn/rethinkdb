      "@coffeemug -- our overload of `to_json` wouldn't affect time objects not produced by ReQL.  We'd implement all the conversions except `native` on the server.  If we have `epoch`, it should return possibly-fractional seconds rather than integral milliseconds because that's what we do everywhere else.  We could add `epoch_milliseconds` or something, though.  (Or if we were feeling really froggy, let people pass an arbitrary ReQL function.)\r\n\r\nI formally retract the global setting; let's just make it an option on `.run` for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
