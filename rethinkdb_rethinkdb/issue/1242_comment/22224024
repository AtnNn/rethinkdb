      "> What happened to our concern about re-inserting values that had lost information?\r\n\r\nWell, we have a choice between the default everyone wants because that's what they use 99% of the time, and a default that's safe that everyone will have to override 99% of the time. In this case I personally lean towards convenience and giving people the option to get a more precise definition."
