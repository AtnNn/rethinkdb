      "If we do add support for things like `iso8601` or `epoch` as time formats, I think we should put the logic on the server for the simple reason that I think we should push all the logic we can to the server.  I think we should do this regardless of whether we settle on a global optarg that controls how time pseudotypes are serialized to protobufs before being sent to the client (Slava's proposal), or with a new ReQL term (Sam's proposal).\r\n\r\nIn the interests of shipping this and not spending too long arguing over the interface, I'd like to propose that we ship with just `raw` and `native`, and add other options if people seem to want them (at which point we'd also have more information about *how* they want them)."
