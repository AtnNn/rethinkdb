      "An optional flag like that isn't a good idea. If you really want to do something like that, a much better solution is to use some higher order magic which could be applicable to anything. For instance, something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\njson.mapAny(contains, ['a', 'b', 'c'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can't happen for a while though, so for now let's just make `contains` variadic and use the conjunction interpretation."
