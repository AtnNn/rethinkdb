      "hard_durability is definitely better than soft_durability.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the boolean parameter is that there's no specific way to say \"do what the default is\" -- you have to specify that by omitting the parameter.  Which is fine with me.  durability=... is also kind of shorter on average, doesn't favor one route versus another, creates more readable code by not being a boolean parameter, and admits other possibile values for the durability parameter, should we want to extend it later."
