        "It's the second part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3938\nIIn the JS driver, `feed.close()` does not immediately send the `STOP` query, see\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/cursor.coffee#L190\n\nTypically this will hang (assuming no operation is happening on the table `test`).\n\n``` js\nr = require('./rethinkdb.js'); // 2.0RC driver\n\nr.connect().bind({}).then(function(connection) {\n  this.connection = connection;\n  return r.db('test').table('test').changes().run(this.connection);\n}).then(function(feed) {\n  feed.each(function(err, change) {\n    if (err) {\n      console.log('ERROR');\n      console.log(err);\n    }\n    else {\n      console.log(change);\n    }\n  });\n  return feed.close();\n}).then(function() { // never called here.\n  console.log('Feed was successfully closed.');\n  return this.connection.close();\n}).then(function() {\n  console.log('Connection was successfully closed.');\n}).error(function(err) {\n  console.log('ERROR');\n  console.log(err);\n});\n```\n\nThe logic related to `closeAsap` should be removed, and the driver should accept to send a `STOP` query even if a `CONTINUE` query is going on. It requires a bit of refactoring since the driver currently assumes one query per token.\n\nI don't know if there's the same problem in the python and ruby driver, but someone should probably take a look.\n"
