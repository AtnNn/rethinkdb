        "It's the second part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3938\r\nIIn the JS driver, `feed.close()` does not immediately send the `STOP` query, see\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/cursor.coffee#L190\r\n\r\nTypically this will hang (assuming no operation is happening on the table `test`).\r\n```js\r\nr = require('./rethinkdb.js'); // 2.0RC driver\r\n\r\nr.connect().bind({}).then(function(connection) {\r\n  this.connection = connection;\r\n  return r.db('test').table('test').changes().run(this.connection);\r\n}).then(function(feed) {\r\n  feed.each(function(err, change) {\r\n    if (err) {\r\n      console.log('ERROR');\r\n      console.log(err);\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      console.log(change);\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n  return feed.close();\r\n}).then(function() { // never called here.\r\n  console.log('Feed was successfully closed.');\r\n  return this.connection.close();\r\n}).then(function() {\r\n  console.log('Connection was successfully closed.');\r\n}).error(function(err) {\r\n  console.log('ERROR');\r\n  console.log(err);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logic related to `closeAsap` should be removed, and the driver should accept to send a `STOP` query even if a `CONTINUE` query is going on. It requires a bit of refactoring since the driver currently assumes one query per token.\r\n\r\nI don't know if there's the same problem in the python and ruby driver, but someone should probably take a look."
