        "Noticed that in the javadriver the method DefaultCursor.getNext(Optional<Long>) ignores the timeout argument. I tried to make a change where the argument was passed to waitOnCursorItems() and to the awaitingContinue.get() method call. Worked fine for me. \n\nI checked out the code but failed to run the tests - guess there is some setup that I need - so I haven't contributed my solution. I can build the code just fine though.\n\nAny hints on what needs to be done to run the tests, or if someone else wants to fix the problem for me that is just fine as well. \n## \n\nRegards \nMagnus\n"
