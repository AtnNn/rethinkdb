      "I'm having some trouble reproducing this, which is weird since @williamstein said it happens every time he does resharding.  I'm trying to reproduce it by making a two-node cluster, opening a few hundred changefeed subscriptions per second, and then either resharding or `kill -9`ing one of the servers.\r\n\r\nA few possibilities off the top of my head:\r\n* It's timing-related, and I need either heavier load or more network latency to catch it.\r\n* It only happens with a particular type of changefeed, or when changefeeds are used in conjunction with some other feature.\r\n* It only shows up for some platforms/configuraitons.  (@williamstein, you're running on Linux, right?)\r\n\r\nTracking down the root source of this will probably take a while, so in the meantime I think we should just do the quick patch so that people experiencing the issue can still reshard or restart a single node under load."
