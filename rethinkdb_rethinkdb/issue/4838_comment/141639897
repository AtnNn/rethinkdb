      "(I'm the other user mentioned above.)  For me this error message appears every time I do any resharding; fortunately I've always been able to resolve it by restarting every database server process (restarting clients has no effect).  This bug means that any resharding of the tables in my rethinkdb cluster involves downtime, which is annoying for a rapidly growing operational website.   Thanks for looking into this! "
