      "@eakova -- we will likely never implement masterless replication in this sense (we're married to an authoritative master per row architecture).\r\n\r\nHowever, we'll implement resharding without loss of availability and automatic master re-election (see #223). Closing this issue, please track #223 for progress on this."
