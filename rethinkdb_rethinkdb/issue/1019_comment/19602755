      "what happens, if write requests count is more than the max number of the write req. that one master can handle ?  \r\nis the statement below valid also for write reqs. or just for read reqs\r\n\r\nHow do queries get routed in a RethinkDB cluster?\r\nYou can connect your clients to any node in the cluster, and all the queries will automatically be routed to their destination. Advanced queries (such as joins, filters, etc.) will be broken up and routed to the appropriate machines, executed in parallel, the resultset will be recombined, and streamed back to the client. The user never has to worry about sending queries to specific nodes\8212 everything happens automatically behind the scenes. "
