      "Hi @krzkrzkrz,\r\n\r\nWe decided to go with string keys because that's what `JSON.parse` does.  Since many people use RethinkDB as a way to store JSON that they were previously storing in some other way, we wanted the documents they get out of it to be as close as possible to the documents they get back from parsing JSON.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nirb(main):1336:0> JSON.parse('{\"a\":1}')\r\n{\"a\"=>1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe might want to consider adding a configuration option for this somewhere, though, or changing the default if enough people complain.  Leaving open for now and moving to backlog until the current performance work is finished."
