      "I agree with @mlucy and think we should stay consistent with `JSON.parse`. I agree that returning strings instead of symbols is confusing at the beginning, but I think returning symbols has hidden costs (symbol gc issue, inconsistency with `JSON.parse`, inconsistency with other drivers).\r\n\r\nI'd like to close this issue, if people feel *really* strongly about it, please feel free to comment/reopen."
