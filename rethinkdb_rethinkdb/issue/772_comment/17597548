      "@randome -- thanks! Your pull request is made off the 1.4.x branch and includes some changes we made in 1.4.x that aren't in next yet. I'm pretty sure it's ok, but I'll double check with the relevant people (mainly @atnnn, I think) tomorrow and get this merged.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your contribution!"
