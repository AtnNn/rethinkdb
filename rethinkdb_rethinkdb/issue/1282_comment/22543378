      "I really like the idea of doing this, and it seems like the only reasonable implementation that makes sense. Having `r.now()` always return the same value seems really odd there (I mean, I understand why it's happening, but it seems to me like an implementation flaw, not something desired by the user). It seems inconsistent with how people thing about queries in general (i.e. when I say `index_create(r.row('a').add(1))` I expected to evaluate once per row/query, not once per the whole thing) .\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I strongly agree with @jdoliner and @mlucy and I strongly disagree with @atnnn."
