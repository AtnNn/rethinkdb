Switch language back to python\r\n5. Scroll the main doc page\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: as you scroll the docs, the left navbar should select the command you're on.\r\nObserved behavior: as you scroll the docs, the left navbar does not select the command you're on.\r\nNote: if I click on any other command on the left navbar and start scrolling the docs, the navbar selects the elements one is on properly."
