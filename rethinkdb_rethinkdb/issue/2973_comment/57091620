      "The idea behind `Promise.promisifyAll` is to get promises from libraries with asynchronous function (like `fs`), and then just using these promises.\r\nThe thing is that doesn't work for the `net` module.\r\n\r\nFor example, you could call `promisify` on [socket.write](http://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_write_data_encoding_callback) but it will be resolved when the data is written out, not when you receive a response from the server (you actually have to parse the data sent form the server to know what query it matches first)."
