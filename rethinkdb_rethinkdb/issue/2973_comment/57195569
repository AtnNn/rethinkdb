      "Oh, thanks @pilwon -- I didn't pay attention to the big `try`/`catch` there. I removed the `try` and just call `Promise.reject`.\r\nUpdated in branch `michel_2973_nodeify`.\r\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of wrapping a method of a CoffeeScript class with `Promise.method`. I haven't tried it, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was to lead to tricky behaviors like this one https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/1948#issuecomment-35473532."
