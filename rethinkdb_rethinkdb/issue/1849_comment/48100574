      "This pull request should probably be closed because the code has changed a lot since it was opened.\r\n\r\nSomehow we let #1388 (and after it, #2090), which this was waiting on, fall through the cracks.  I think we should schedule that more aggressively.\r\n\r\nClosing, although I think we should make similar changes once #2090 is done.\r\n\r\nSorry we dropped the ball on this @nviennot !"
