      "Here's what I think we should do here:\r\n\r\n1. `rethinkdb help COMMAND` should be equivalent to `rethinkdb COMMAND --help` (just like `rethinkdb help` is currently equivalent to `rethinkdb --help`)\r\n2. When someone types `rethinkdb help`, in addition to what we already display, we should first display usage for `rethinkdb` command itself with all the relevant options.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly equivalent to how dotcloud does it (for internal devs, type `dotcloud --help` on newton), and it's awesome!\r\n\r\n"
