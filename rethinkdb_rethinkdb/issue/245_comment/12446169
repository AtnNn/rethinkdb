      "I have a change in code review now to use the help pager for all the other 'rethinkdb help' commands, but it doesn't solve the format discrepancies and whatnot.  I should mention that I formatted the admin help pages to look very similar to the `man` format, since the admin use cases are much more diverse and complicated than the `rethinkdb <command>` use cases."
