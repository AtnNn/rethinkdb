      "I'm sort of tacking a new issue on to this so feel free to tell me to shove it and make a separate issue but our command line flags have this behavior where the prefixes of flags work in place of the flags. One person on IRC mentioned being confused by this because he used the flag `--port` which rethinkdb accepts and interprets as a port offset but he was hoping this would set the cluster port.\r\n\r\nI suspect that boost will take a flag which will just stop this from happening and it seems like it's causing a slight bit of trouble and I haven't really observed it helping people."
