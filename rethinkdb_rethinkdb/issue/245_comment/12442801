      "Also, some commands use a pager (admin) if the docs don't fit on screen, and others do not. We need standardized behavior on this. (I feel really strongly about using the pager everywhere if help doesn't fit on screen, but if everyone else hates that, I won't stand in the way of removing it. But we do need a consistent behavior across all commands)."
