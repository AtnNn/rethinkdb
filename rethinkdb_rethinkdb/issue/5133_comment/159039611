      "I'm going to close this since there's nothing to do about this right now.\r\n\r\nIt's very useful for us to hear that connectivity between different minor versions is important for your setup. We'll be extra careful about such compatibility-breaking changes in the future (I'm optimistic about this since 2.1 was a bit of an exception. We had just completely replaced the way clustering worked in RethinkDB, and had to fix a few critical issues that showed up. Hopefully this won't happen again any time soon)."
