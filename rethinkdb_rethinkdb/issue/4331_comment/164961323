      "Ah yeah, I forgot to mention that but we obviously should.\r\n\r\nI think using `wait` instead of just retrying the query might have better efficiency. An expensive query can cause a lot of server load even when it fails.\r\nConsider a query like `r.table(\"largeTable\").sum(\"val\")`. If all but one shards are available, all available shards are going to run this query on every attempt, which could take minutes in extreme cases."
