        "Despite getting closer to 2.1, I'd like to release at least another point release for the 2.0.x branch.\n\n2.0.3 is affected by a crashing bug that a few people have run into by now (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4430), and even after we ship 2.1.0, I think a lot of people will keep running 2.0.x versions for a while.\n- [x] prepare release notes\n- [x] run pre-release tests\n- [x] tag, build, upload\n- [x] tweet etc.\n- [ ] update brew, update AWS\n\n(mentioning @atnnn. I'll get started with the release notes...)\n"
