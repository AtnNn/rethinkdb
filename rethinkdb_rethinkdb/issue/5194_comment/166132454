      "You may want to have your legal guys take a quick look at the [license terms](http://modernievirt.blob.core.windows.net/vhd/release_notes_license_terms_1_5_15.pdf) linked from that download page, in particular page 5:\r\n\r\n> You  may  install and use  the  software  on one  computer for  use  by  one  person at  a time ... You  may  use  the  software  for  testing  purposes  only ... You  may  not  use  the  software  for \r\ncommercial purposes ... You may not use the software in a live operating environment.\r\n\r\n> You  may  use  the  software  for  90  days  after  it  is  downloaded  to  the licensed computer. The software will stop running after 90 days...\r\n\r\nIt's not a big deal, but it is worth keeping in mind. In a previous corporate setting, we looked into using the test-IE VMs for various purposes - and ultimately decided to use them for browser testing but not for build & CI purposes, instead using MSDN for that.\r\n\r\nYour Mileage May Vary, I Am Not A Lawyer, etc."
