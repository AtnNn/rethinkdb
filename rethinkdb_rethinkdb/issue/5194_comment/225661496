      "@juliankrispel Yes, this is fixed. However we don't provide 32 bit Windows binaries (only 64 bit).\r\n\r\nYou could build from source using the `windows_v2.3.3` branch (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/windows_v2.3.3/WINDOWS.md for instructions). However running on 32-bit Windows isn't well tested and not officially supported."
