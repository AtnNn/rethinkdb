        "I recently ran into a problem with the driver I'm building where I'd send a query over a connection, wait for the result, then send another query on the same connection. The second query would never get a response and the connection timed out.\r\n\r\nI found that the reason was because I was sending the client version (`V0_1 = 0x3f61ba36;`) at the beginning of every query, instead of just once at the beginning of the connection. Sending it once when the connection is opened and not after that fixed things, but the wording in [the v1.4.x protobuf specification](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/v1.4.x/src/rdb_protocol/ql2.proto) threw me off. It might be good to make a quick note of that when you guys get a minute."
