        "While playing with the json import from the CLI in 1.7x I noticed that documents that have nested arrays of objects do no import correctly. The columns import properly (but are null) and if the nested objects contain have names that match the outer object then new rows are created \n\nI created a gist that has a sample input JSON, command used to import, the data explorer command from the web ui and the resulting raw output which shows the bad import\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/intabulas/5950988\n\nalso as an FYI: ubuntu 14.04 and rethinkdb 1.7.1-0ubuntu1~raring (GCC 4.7.3)\n"
