      "Hi goors,\r\n\r\nIf the proxy connects to at least one node in your cluster, that node will tell it about all the other nodes in your cluster, and the proxy will then start talking to them.  If you add new nodes to the cluster, the proxy should automatically start talking to them.\r\n\r\nClosing since this isn't a bug, but feel free to ask more questions here."
