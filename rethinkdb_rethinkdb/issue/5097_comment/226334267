      "It would also very nice if console logs included timestamps. I often see logs from servers in my cluster which say that another server has connected or disconnected on the intra-cluster port but I have no idea *when* it happened.\r\n\r\nIs there an overarching issue about improving logs? specifically the logs to stderr/stdout?"
