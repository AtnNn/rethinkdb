      "Oh, I did not know that. Is there a way to disable that and only log to stdout and stderr? This is the prescribed method for application logs in Docker containers. From there, you can configure various logging plugins to handle logs from your containers. The default is for Docker to just write stdout and stderr to a file that it manages but you can also configure it to send output to a Syslog endpoint for example, which is what many people do."
