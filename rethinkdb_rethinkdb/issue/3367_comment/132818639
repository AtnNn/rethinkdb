      "Well it's might be nice to combine both features. Something which works like:\r\n\r\nWhen there are changes on X do notify me.\r\n\r\nAnd then, connect and let the database push me changes.\r\n\r\nElse let me fetch the pushes at once, without any push.\r\n\r\nWhen reconnecting via push-request to a trigger, you'll receive everything which hasn't been pushed.\r\n\r\nThis would meet my requirements :)"
