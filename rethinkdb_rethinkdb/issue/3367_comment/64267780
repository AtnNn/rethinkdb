      "We are going to provide a reliable variant of changefeeds, hopefully relatively soon (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2953 ).\r\n\r\nTriggers wouldn't automatically be more reliable than changefeeds. I think we can provide pretty much the same guarantees in either case (we just have to design and implement the semantics for them).\r\nA changefeed based interface on the other hand would fit a little better into our current API."
