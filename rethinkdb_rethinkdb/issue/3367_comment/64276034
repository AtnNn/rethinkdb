      "@thelinuxlich @danielmewes \r\n\r\nI like to keep my code as close to my data as i can to keep my genrutnees as strong as i can. I think a few options could make this more of the users probelm to solve. For example the user should be able to know that the write to the down table failed so then they can write to another local  table that then they can have a function to fix what ever events are missing so then they are incharge of whatever consicstancy issues occure.\r\n\r\nIf possiable there should be a global hidden table of functions that triggers can use. this way if you need 10 tables to use the same trigger which does a join and replaces the record that becomes an option. My feeling is this works a lot easier being emdbed in the database. \r\n\r\nTriggers are used when rethinkdb needs to work with updated or inserted data on its own side internal. Change feeds is when the user application wants to be notified that of changes in the database.\r\n\r\nA change feed is like on a message board or blog. someone has added a new comment so the app listening will be able to know and push that out. But triggers are for background jobs data chances in the db that the app doe not need to know abotu and for built in fetaures that can effect the rest of the app easily and does not require restarting a process. A good example of this is logging changes to fields if your appli=cation allows you to edit your email address the trigger will log everytime you change your email address and aovid appliaation logic meaning it will work regardless of client."
