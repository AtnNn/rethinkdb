Changefeeds were added to artificial tables too late in the 1.16 cycle to do this, but we should do it now\r\n\r\nThis is probably better as a meta-issue for incrementally converting parts of the WebUI to changefeeds, since it doesn't need to be done all at once. As I get to these, I'll create sub issues and link to them here:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Dashboard\r\n- [ ] Top bar (this is present all the time)\r\n- [ ] Table index\r\n- [ ] Table page\r\n- [ ] Server index\r\n- [ ] Server page"
