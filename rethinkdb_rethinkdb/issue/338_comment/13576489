      "`pluck` will not throw in 1.5. We decided *not* to change this aspect in 1.4 because it would be too much for @mlucy to do and for us to think about. The current server in next implements pluck that's inconsistent with other semantics, so I asked Mike to change it back to what it was in 1.4.\r\n\r\nIn 1.5 we'll address this problem and make this work pretty much the way you've wanted it all along :)"
