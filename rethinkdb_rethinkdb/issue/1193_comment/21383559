      "Also @mlucy, in reference to `-x` working in Ruby, I think it's a really bad policy to unilaterally implement things in the Ruby driver that aren't implemented in other drivers and discussed as language features. It's very hard to keep all of these features in sync between drivers and having undocumented, untested, undiscussed features that one developer decided to implement without talking to anyone is going to make things that much harder."
