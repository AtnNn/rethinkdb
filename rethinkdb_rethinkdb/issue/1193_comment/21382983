      "I don't think this is important (since it's not something that prevents people from doing useful work and there is an easy workaround anyway), but I'm pretty opposed to introducing `r.negate`. I suppose this is reopening a previous discussion (which was closed for different reasons), but I think a good way to do this is `r.sub(x)`. I would expect it to return `-x`, and it would make implementing negation operators in drivers really easy. I realize this is somewhat controversial, though."
