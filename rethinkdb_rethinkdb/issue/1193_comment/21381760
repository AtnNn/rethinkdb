      "@mlucy, what matters is not how many lines this would take to implement but the number of inconsistencies, edge cases, and surprises driver developer has to deal with. Every individual inclusion of client side code transformation, however trivial, is a one-off that doesn't follow the simple pattern of \"normal\" ReQL commands and thus adds significantly to the burden of developing a driver.\r\n\r\nWe've allowed a few of these to sneak into the code base (scanning for `r.row` and wrapping with a function where we expect one is probably the worse example) but I'd really like to hold the line against more, however simple they might seem."
