      "The downsides for doing client side sugaring are:\r\n- driver devs have to implement the sugar. Admittedly this is easy sugar to implement but still I think there's a big step between having to implement no sugar and having to implement a small amount of sugar.\r\n- it actually could misbehave. `sub` already has a few extra meanings attached to it in particular with arrays so I could see someone getting some confusing error messages if they negate something that evaluates to an array.\r\n- Wrong backtraces is a cost. Where are the other places we show wrong backtraces.\r\n\r\nOverall these downsides seem a lot worse than an extra protocol buffer term. We're adding like 20 terms for dates at this point."
