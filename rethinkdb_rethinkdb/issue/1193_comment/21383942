      "@jdoliner -- it's been implemented since the first complete version of the Ruby client, I think.  (Or, if not, since pretty close to there.)  I think it may also have been implemented in at least one version of Ryan's python driver, but I'm not sure about that.\r\n\r\n@wmrowan -- I think I like doing nothing the least, long-term, although this certainly isn't a high-priority issue.\r\n\r\nI agree with @coffeemug that introducing `r.negate` just to support prefix `-` smells wrong -- it clutters up the language with a basically useless term.\r\n\r\nSince most people seem to agree that this is a low-priority issue, and it's in backlog, can we hold off on further discussion until it's scheduled for a sprint?"
