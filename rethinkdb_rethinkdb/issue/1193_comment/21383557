      "@coffeemug we don't have to introduce `r.negate`. We just have to overload unary `-` in Python to produce a term of type NEGATE. In js though we'd have to introduce something like `r.neg(1)` or `r(1).neg()`. Mostly, I just want to make sure we don't do `-x => (r.expr(0) - x)`.\r\n\r\nI do agree that this isn't very important and I'd rather just not do this than introduce `r.negate(x)` or `r.sub(x)`."
