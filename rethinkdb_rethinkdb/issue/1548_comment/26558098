      "Hmm so when I restart RethinkDB on the database now, memory consumption goes up to 23 % all by itself, without running a single query (note that I had decreased the LBA_READ_BUFFER_SIZE in src/conf/args to 128 MB before doing this). Then, when I proceed to insert a few documents, it rises to ~88 %.\r\n\r\nGuess this could be completely unrelated to the preceding DB dump."
