      "@mlucy I didn't realize the sorting was stored on disk, but that makes sense. So generally speaking would it be faster to do `.orderBy({ index: ... }).filter({ ... })` instead of `.getAll(..., { index: ... }).orderBy(...)` or does it just depend on the underlying data?\r\n\r\n**[edit]:** assuming you're sorting and filtering on two different fields."
