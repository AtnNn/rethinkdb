      "yea restarting the server reliably fixes it. i have also noticed a one case where it fixed itself (took a few hours).\r\n\r\none other thing i observed is that while the web UI is messed up, the server itself is non responsive. running queries from client drivers, for example, hang. this is kind of a bigger issue than just the UI being unresponsive."
