      "Ok -- so, still not quite sure what the issue is. It seems like we can semi-reliably replicate the issue by\r\n\r\n1. running a heavy query `r.table(\"my_table\").group(\"my_agg\").count()`\r\n2. doing a few web ui queries\r\n\r\nat some point the db becomes unresponsive to any queries. The UI shows that indexes are gone, or sometimes, even the tables and servers are gone. The dashboard, however, always seem to chug along. \r\n\r\nThe only solution at that point is to restart the servers.\r\n\r\nAlso I was doing an htop while this all happened and I don't see anything obviously wrong. CPU load is low, iowait is ~20%, we still have ~45gbs memory free. \r\n\r\nUsing 3 nodes, running i2.4xlarge EC2's with SSD EBS attached (in theory, beefy)\r\n\r\nData size ~550M rows at ~10 Tbs"
