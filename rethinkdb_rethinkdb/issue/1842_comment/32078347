      "Thanks @nviennot !  This looks awesome.  I'll review it either today or Monday.\r\n\r\nCould you fill out the CLA (http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/) if you haven't already?\r\n\r\nI agree we should seriously consider making the backtraces an optional feature you can turn on (or maybe they could default to on when you call `.repl`) rather than using them all the time.  Does anybody else object strongly to that?\r\n\r\n"
