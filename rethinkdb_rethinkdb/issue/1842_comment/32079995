      "I wasn't sure if I filled the CLA, so I did it.\r\n\r\nHow can backtrace be turned on/off (globally)?\r\n\r\n`RethinkDB::RQL.full_backtraces = true` somewhat makes sense.\r\n\r\nThe repl thing is not a good idea I think, because you don't need a backtrace in a repl, you just typed the query, you know where it's coming from.\r\nI think this feature should be disabled by default. When there is an exception, you can have in the exception message \"set r.full_backtraces = true if you want more precise backtraces\"\r\nIf it's enabled by default, people may complain about rethinkdb being slow (esp. when publishing benchmark numbers), and will not know that this is a feature to turn off to get speed.\r\n\r\nIf it was up to me, I'd remove the funky backtrace feature entirely. Not worth the trouble. The benefits are really small IMHO."
