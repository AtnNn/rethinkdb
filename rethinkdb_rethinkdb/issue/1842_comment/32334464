      "I did some benchmarking here.  The backtraces seem to materially impact performance, but https://github.com/nviennot/rethinkdb/commit/f627a730449cd1228a7d410d9f055289d8a0a3c4 doesn't seem to change much.  Using Daniel's RubyDatabaseBenchmarks in Ruby 2.0 on Electro, it seems to affect the benchmark by <1% (and possibly not at all; it certainly has a smaller effect than the variance between runs).  I think the extra .03ms it saves isn't noticeable under normal conditions right now.\r\n\r\nSince it makes the logic more complicated (and uses `eval`), I'd like to avoid merging it unless there's a common use case where we know it improves performance by a noticeable amount.  What do other people think?\r\n\r\nAs for the backtraces, I think we should just drop them entirely (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1843 )."
