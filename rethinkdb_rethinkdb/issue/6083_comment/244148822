      "Hey @bchavez. I checked the idea of an old release and you were absolutely right. \r\n\r\nThere was a wrong class path somewhere in the code that caused the release 2.2.beta mistakenly being loaded to jvm. I removed that and it worked like a charm.\r\n\r\nThanks a million again for your help."
