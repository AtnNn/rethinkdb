      "Thanks a million @bchavez,  it is very illuminating. I will check it and let you know. \r\nI'm using the following sbt include and the stack trace is fully machine made :). So there is some problem traceable if this is the old version stack trace. \r\n\r\n`libraryDependencies += \"com.rethinkdb\" % \"rethinkdb-driver\" % \"2.3.3\"`\r\n\r\nI should clear Maven's cache to see what happens next.\r\n\r\nCheers"
