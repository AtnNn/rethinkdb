      "> \"but that would make it impossible to use this for between predicates for example\", what do you mean by 'impossible'?\r\n\r\n@Morgul -- what @danielmewes meant here is that if we restrict the optimizer to terms like `filter({a: b})`, the optimizer wouldn't be able to optimize queries of the type `a < b < c` (where as if we went with the original proposal, we'd be able to optimize both). I actually like your syntax (though we'd have to figure out how to optimize things like \"give me every user with age greater than 30\").\r\n\r\nFor anyone watching this issue, this is still a bit far away, but will definitely get done. Without committing to a specific ETA, I think we can get it into RethinkDB 2.4 or 2.5. (I realize that's inconvenient, and I'd *love* to do this earlier, but Rethink has been picking up popularity, and we have a ton of very valid feature requests from all kinds of different users and unfortunately limited engineering throughput capacity)"
