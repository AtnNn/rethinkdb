      "@marshall007 I think the optimizer could rewrite `order_by(index='price')` to `order_by(index_fun)` where `index_fun` would be the index function by which the `price` index is defined.\r\nWhile we don't currently expose the stored index function through ReQL, we could definitely give the optimizer a way of loading it."
