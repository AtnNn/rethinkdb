      "I'm being hard on the devs, but I hope it's taken from the angle that I wan't RethinkDB to be amazing.\r\n\r\nIf they could achieve the concept that filter was able to intelligently execute a query. So that it could be chained, yet still executed quickly. Then I think RethinkDB would reach a point where even non-programmers could get *some* use of it.\r\n\r\nAnd, it would better mesh with the software that is created around it. As a dev, I could offer users options for filtering the data they work with without worrying about a **bad** performance edge case.\r\n\r\nIt would become so much more accessible..."
