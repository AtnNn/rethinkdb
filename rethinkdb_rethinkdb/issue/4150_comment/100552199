      "@kofalt\r\n>I think this gets into dev vs ops: correctness & performance are two different concerns. The developer has the most complete information for making a query correct; I assert that (in many cases) the database has the most complete information for making a query performant.\r\n\r\nI Absolutely Agree on that. The database is the right place to optimize.\r\n\r\nBut why do you want an optarg at all?\r\n\r\nWhy not optimize by default, So that the following applies to RethinkDB?\r\n\r\n1. Construct a RethinkDB statement.\r\n2. Execute; monitor deployments for slow queries.\r\n"
