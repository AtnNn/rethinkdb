      "These updates sound very positive.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it @mlucy + @danielmewes have endorsed proposals 1 and/or 2 from my comment.\r\nIf either of those come to fruition I will be greatly satisfied with the result. \r\n\r\nThe distinction between \"fiddling with specific index usage\" versus \"optimizing\" a query makes sense, and I appreciate the later being much larger in scope - attacking the former first is understandable.\r\n\r\nIn summary: Allowing arbitrary terms and/or a global optarg would solve my qualms with this feature."
