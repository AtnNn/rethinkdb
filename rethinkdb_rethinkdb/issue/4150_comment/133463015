      "As a DBA working with both SQL Server and PostgreSQL I get the frustration of working with a query optimize. I also understand the the complexity of code that goes into writing such a beast.  My concerns about no or a limited optimizer are:\r\n\r\n*  Metadata availability  #3231, someone/something has to optimize the query. If its me or code from the dev I work with we need a systematic and authoritative way to get the information.\r\n* If there are limits on the order and/or the number of index enable operations (I hope there is not) it would be nice for it to very clear in the ReQL language definition because this could be a deal breaker.  \r\n* some kind of dry-run tool immensely helpfully in learning ReQL and verifying these hand-built plans"
