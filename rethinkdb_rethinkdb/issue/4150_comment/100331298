      "Essentially, in the above use case where filters are chained...\r\n\r\nThe solution that worked best for me, was to use ElasticSearch. Somehow, it's fast no matter what.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly outside the scope of the project. But it would be cool if I didn't need ElasticSearch for that. It seems like RethinkDB should be able to do this. Although, as I found out myself in my own *meager* attempt at optimization, it's complicated."
