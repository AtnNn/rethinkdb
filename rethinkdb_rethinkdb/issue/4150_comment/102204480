      "Have you guys thought about how the optimizer is going to disambiguate between indices that point to a field vs. the ones that are computed? Given @coffeemug's example, let's say the `price` index is actually defined as `r.row('list_price').mul(r.row('discount'))`. In cases like this the optimizer would have no choice but to do the `.order_by(index='price')` first, correct? Since it wouldn't have access to the secondary index function used to compute those values."
