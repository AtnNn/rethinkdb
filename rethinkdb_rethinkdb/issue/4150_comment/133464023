      "I completely agree @eldritch-fossicker .  SQL Servers's query optimizer seems almost non-deterministic at times.  We've had queries that run fine in our testing environments, and ridiculously slow in Production because the query optimizer came up with a different plan.\r\n\r\nWith ReQL in it's current state you explicityly tell rethinkdb how you want it to retrieve your data.  I'm fine with the addition of a query optimizer, just so we're not forced to use it (which sounds like the proposed plan)."
