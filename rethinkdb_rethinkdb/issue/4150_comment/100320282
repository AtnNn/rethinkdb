      "Why do I get the feeling that RethinkDB complexity is starting to spin out of control....\r\n\r\n> Ahhh, the days when you could just create an index and **BAM** everything was faster.\r\n\r\nWhy do I feel like I'm the only one that thinks work should revolve around filter?\r\nThat the picture of success looks like filter (and only filter)?\r\n\r\nWant to offer more power to control freaks? great. But all a user should **need** is filter.\r\n\r\nEven most ORMs get this.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**User** Hi database! I'd like a table.\r\n```\r\nr.table('stuff')\r\n```\r\n**Database** Here's a table!\r\n**User** uh...I actually don't want everything.\r\n**Database** Oh, you want less than a table? Great! send me a filter.\r\n**User** OKAY!\r\n```\r\nr.table('stuff').filter({idontwantthis: true})\r\n```\r\n**Database** Here you go! All the stuff you don't want is missing!\r\n**User** Sweet! What took so long?\r\n**Database** Oh I scanned the whole table. You need an index.\r\n**User** OKAY!\r\n```\r\nr.table('stuff').filter({idontwantthis: true})\r\n```\r\n**Database** Here you go! All the stuff you don't want is missing!\r\n**User** Sweet! What took so long?\r\n**Database** Oh I scanned the whole table.\r\n**User** Why? I made an index.\r\n**Database** Well, you didn't tell me to use it.\r\n**User** OKAY!\r\n```\r\nr.table('stuff').getAll(true, {'index': 'idontwantthis'})\r\n```\r\n**Database** Here you go! All the stuff you don't want is missing!\r\n**User** Sweet! That was way faster!\r\n**User** Okay, now I need all the stuff that I don't want, and my user is asking for only red items.\r\n**Database** Use 2 filters.\r\n**User** Won't that be slow?\r\n**Database** Oh yeah, better go grab a frosty cold beverage.\r\n**Database** You could use an index for one of the parameters, and filter the remaining.\r\n**User** Hmm.. Which one should I use the index for?\r\n**Database** How should I know? I'm just a database.\r\n**Database** Well, there is a *special* trick you can use...\r\n**Database** You could tell me that you want it optimized...\r\n**User** Does anybody ever not want it optimized?\r\n**Database** Overwhelmingly No, but you have to ask anyway.\r\n***\r\nIsn't it kinda backwards to have it take *more* code to do it the easy way, and *less* code to do it the hard way?\r\n\r\nShouldn't it be assumed that I want my filter to run fast?\r\n\r\n### Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
