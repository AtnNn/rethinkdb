      "@danielmewes that makes sense. I didn't read @coffeemug's example carefully enough. I assumed he was chaining the `getAll/between/orderBy` all on the same index (i.e. that it was still a \"valid\" ReQL command in today's world) and the only thing `optimize` was going to do was decide how best to order the terms.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it also decides which indices to use makes what I suggested less important. We were actually able to implement `filter` optimizations in `thinky` ([see PR](https://github.com/neumino/thinky/pull/126)) because we know about the indices on a model without having to query the table for them. However, I actually prefer the explicitly chained `getAll`s in your example over what I suggested because it makes things more obvious."
