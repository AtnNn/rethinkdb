      "@coffeemug -- we'll have to be transforming the source code anyway.  `.get_all` returns a type that you can't call e.g. `.between` on, so if a user writes `.get_all.between` our type system is already being violated and we'll have to rewrite it to something else.  As long as we're rewriting code anyway, it isn't that much more work to rewrite `optimize` with a lambda to something else as well, preventing us from trying to store a stream in a variable.  (It might still be confusing to users, though, which would be a reason not to do it.)"
