      "I agree with @kofalt and @internalfx.\r\n\r\nTo me, manually ordering terms and explicitly defining which indexes are used is an advanced feature, something you would only want to do when you have a complex enterprise app that needs to have more predictable performance. I think a lot of users expect the database to do the \"best\" thing by default.\r\n"
