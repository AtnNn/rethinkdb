      "So, this is basically what i want to say. Have a flag on `conn` if you want a certain query to be optimized, this way you can just stick it into the `run` method of the query and this will work across drivers and won\8217t interfere with what hard core optimizers want, which is to hand pick their indexes. In the mean time, improve the optimizer so that at one point you won\8217t need to hand pick your indexes anymore.\r\n\r\nHowever, this raises an issue that what if the optimizer does something unexpected. Well, if we can build a tool comparing average query time, we can help identify the queries that need hand picked indexes to run optimally.\r\n\r\nWith any optimizer, things will always be a work in progress, but progress will be made with efficiency. With this approach, we can pave the way for the beginnings of an optimizer that gets better with each iteration while leaving those who need highly optimized queries to get their jobs done, the option to do so."
