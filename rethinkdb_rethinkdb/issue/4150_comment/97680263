      "If I'm not mistaken indexed operations can only happen in the first term (and possibly subsequent terms in the case of `order_by/between`) following `r.table`. Given that, is there any reason why the developer needs to define the portion of the query that should be subjected to optimization?\r\n\r\n**[edit]:** my point being, if what I said is true, it might be simpler if `optimize=true` could be set as an optarg to `run` on individual queries and possibly at the connection level during development."
