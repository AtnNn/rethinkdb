      "I like that this proposal involves a limited and well-defined set of optimizations. If `optimize` were a global optarg, it wouldn't be clear what parts of the query were getting optimized or how.\r\n\r\nI'm a little uncomfortable with the idea of allowing operations inside `optimize` that we don't allow outside of `optimize`, like `.get_all.between`."
