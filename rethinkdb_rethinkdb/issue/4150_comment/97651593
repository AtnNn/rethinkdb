      "I would much prefer:\r\n```rb\r\nr.optimize {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```rb\r\nr.begin_optimize()...end_optimize()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fact that we didn't do that with `group/ungroup` has been biting us in the ass ever since, and in this case we're going to need to do syntax examination anyway so the argument about types doesn't really apply.\r\n\r\nAs for the actual meat of the proposal, this is definitely easier than other things we could do and solves a real use case without introducing too much magic.  I'd like to think about it more, but it's actually a pretty exciting proposal!"
