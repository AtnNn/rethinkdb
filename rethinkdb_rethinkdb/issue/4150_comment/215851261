      "@saikat We haven't fully fixed the set of features for 2.4 yet, but I think the primary candidates for that release are https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3997 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/746 .\r\n\r\nI think realistically we will get to this one (optimizer) for either 2.5 or 2.6."
