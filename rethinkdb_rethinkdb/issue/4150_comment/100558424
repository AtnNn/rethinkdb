      "Largely motivated by a desire to work within the goals of the RDB developers. It's clear that there are differing opinions on index usage semantics, but that doesn't preclude a productive & pragmatic discussion on satisfying both use cases.\r\n\r\nI don't have strong opinions about default vs opt-in, and would be happy with either. My main concern is making sure RDB optimizer design does not make it more painful to write index-agnostic queries. "
