      "@mlucy  I'm not sure that optimizing filters automatically leads us to the situation you are describing.\r\n\r\nI'm not advocating for removing the ability to be explicit about queries.\r\n\r\nAre you developing enterprise systems that handle thousands of users a day?\r\nAre you worried that the next RethinkDB update will bring your app to a crawl?\r\n\r\n> Then you should be explicit about what indexes you wish to use in your queries.\r\n\r\nIs your app small?\r\nAre you lazy?\r\nIs it not the end of the world if your app goes down?\r\n\r\n> Then you could roll the dice and let our optimizer do it for you.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSee the difference?\r\n\r\nIts still totally easy and accessible to new users.\r\nIt's easy for small apps.\r\n\r\nIf you have a big enterprise app, then you will need to know what you are doing anyway. That's not the realm of inexperienced devs.\r\n\r\nForcing explicit indexes is RethinkDB making assumptions about the apps requirements."
