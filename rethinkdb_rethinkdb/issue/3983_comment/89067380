      "Ok, I decided to go back to the drawing board and to look at the facts again from scratch. I noticed something very interesting, which was that the error I got in Safari 8 when the server shuts down was not the same as the error you got:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Error] Failed to load resource: The network connection was lost.\r\n```\r\n\r\nApparently, this is triggered in safari when a response is received with a Content-Length header longer than the actual content body. Safari assumes it is just missing the rest of the data and errors out. Other browsers will render the content, but may or may not put an error into the console.\r\n\r\n@ftKnox could you try to replicate it again in Chrome, but check the console? Chrome shouldn't fail if this is the issue, but will output an error to the console."
