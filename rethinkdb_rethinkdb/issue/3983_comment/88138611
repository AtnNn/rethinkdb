      "@deontologician Its doesn't happen 100% of the time, but its greater than 50%. Just clicking around in the interface (typically on tables is where I notice it most) also triggers this behavior. Also note, that I access my admin panel by ip and or a hostname aliased in my /etc/hosts file. Maybe something in the way the url router parses?"
