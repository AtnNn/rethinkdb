      "So, I was able to replicate this by randomly modifying the `Content-Length` header, so that every 10 requests or so it will be too long.  Then when the ui reconnects, it loads everything and this triggers another disconnect since so many requests are happening at once.\r\n\r\nThis might happen if you have a firewall or other network equipment that is maybe mucking with http headers. Since the web ui doesn't use https, it's vulnerable to this kind of thing.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes suggested since we have a custom http server, it's possible something we are doing is triggering the firewall and that's what's causing the response to fail. @ftKnox would it be possible for you to do a [wireshark](www.wireshark.org) capture of your network traffic while you're interacting with the webui, until a failure happens? [Instructions are here](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChapterCapture.html). We could analyze the results of that and see if anything about the individual requests is special"
