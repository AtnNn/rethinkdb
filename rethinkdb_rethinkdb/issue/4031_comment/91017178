      "Thanks for the suggestion @bigtree3131 .\r\n\r\nDo you have an example use case for this?\r\n\r\nWith the query `r.expr([MY_ARRAY_VALS]).contains(VAL)` the array has to be constructed in linear time anyway. I suspect that adding an index will have a higher overhead than doing a second linear scan for the `contains`. So this would only make sense if you constructed an array once and then did multiple `contains` checks on it. Is that what you had in mind?"
