      Just
        "It is becoming very common for all intra-datacenter connections to be encrypted. Currently rethinkdb makes this very difficult. For the client connections there are recommendations for SSH tunnelling in the docs and TLS connections support in most drivers. However running TLS requires a manual proxy that is not integrated with rethinkdb. Furthermore there appears to be no way to encrypt server-to-server traffic.\n\nThe primary benefits of integrating TLS into the server are:\n- Intra-cluster traffic can be encrypted.\n- Strong and simple authorization can be supported using the SSH key infrastructure.\n  - Client certificates can be used for authentication.\n  - A CA key can be used to sign all of the clients certificates.\n  - Authorized keys (and CA keys) can be managed in rethinkdb tables.\n\nThis allows a better authentication system that can be easily managed from rethinkdb itself, without requiring orchestration of many proxy processes that have to be managed individually.\n\nAnother eventual target for this could be the webui but personally I see that as a much lower priority.\n"
