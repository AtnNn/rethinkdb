      "Hey @igorlukanin so this is definitely something we should do, but there's a couple of issues with the PR as it is now:\r\n\r\n1. It has conflicts (this is kinda my fault since it's been so long since you made the PR)\r\n2. It doesn't handle cursors\r\n3. I think the .runList should just happen through .run\r\n\r\nThe strategy I'm thinking of is passing the .class object down through to `runQuery` in the `Connection` class, and having the cursor be aware of what class it's serializing to, as well as mapping over List when it's returned. This way you can do `.run(conn, options, Foo.class)` and get a `Cursor<Foo>` back, or a `List<Foo>` depending on what the server returns.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"
