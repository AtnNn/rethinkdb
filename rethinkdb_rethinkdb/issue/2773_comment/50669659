      "Note to whoever will take this issue:\r\nWe also decided to treat geometry (`PTYPE<GEOMETRY>`) like objects in (non-geo) secondary indexes.\r\nIn `daniel_geo` trying to use a geometry object as a secondary index key currently fails in `datum_t::pt_to_str_key()`. Once we have support for converting objects to secondary index keys, we should use that same function in that place as well (though with a different prefix to maintain between-types ordering).\r\nFeel free to assign the transfer to geometry pseudo types to me once the code for handling objects is there."
