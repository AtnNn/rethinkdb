      "To be honest I'm dubious about the benefit of this at this point, though I could be convinced otherwise. It's not trivial to implement, and I think there are more relevant things to spend our time on.\r\n\r\nIn fact I haven't yet seen a complete suggestion of how we could implement this without making either writes or resharding inefficient (the latter *could* be acceptable under some circumstances, but only if we have good reasons for doing it). If there has ever been a plan, I would like to hear about it."
