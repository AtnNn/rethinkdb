      "I've talked to @coffeemug offline and the implementations we are aware of have some considerable drawbacks and/or are difficult to implement.\r\n\r\nEventually with change feeds that survive disconnects (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2953) and some extensions to change feeds on reductions (#1118), this could be implemented on top of that with the following properties:\r\n- The first time one runs `count()` after some node failed or a server was restarted it would still be a linear time operation\r\n- From that point on we could use the change feed infrastructure to keep track of changes to the document count on the parsing nodes that run the `count()` queries, making it a constant-time operation."
