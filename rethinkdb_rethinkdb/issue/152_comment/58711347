      "> So for getting that to work, we would have to recompute the counts whenever shard boundaries change.\r\n\r\nGiven that we already lose availability when resharding, that seems pretty OK.  When we reshard, we just run a slow count query at the end before the table becomes available (or if we wanted to be clever, we could only run the slow count query on the part of the btree that changed hands)."
