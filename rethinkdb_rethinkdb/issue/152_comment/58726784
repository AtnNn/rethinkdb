      "> For example, it's totally reasonable to have two machines and two shards, where each machine is master for one shard but holds a copy for the other; and that has the same problem.\r\n\r\nIn that case do we also implement resharding by moving an invisible line, so some documents that were part of a replica for shard 2 are now part of the master for shard 1?"
