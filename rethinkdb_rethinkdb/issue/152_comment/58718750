      "If you define \"oversharding\" as \"having more shards than machines\", this problem can occur even without oversharding. For example, it's totally reasonable to have two machines and two shards, where each machine is master for one shard but holds a copy for the other; and that has the same problem. So there isn't really any point in forbidding oversharding."
