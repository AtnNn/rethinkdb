      Just
        "@mlucy suggested backtraces that can span coroutine boundaries. More specifically, if you do a coro_t::spawn...(), we should store a backtrace at the time of spawning. When we later crash while inside a coroutine, we first generate the backtrace within the coroutine just as we do now, and then append the stored backtrace from the point where the coroutine has been spawned.\r\n\r\nTaking and storing all these backtraces is of course slightly costly, so we would probably only do it in debug mode. Still sounds like a very useful thing though and it is pretty easy to do.\r\n\r\nI'm taking this because I've already done some refactoring of the backtrace code recently."
