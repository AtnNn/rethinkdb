      "This sounds related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3263\r\n\r\nAre the plugin and application importing the driver from the same directory, or are those separate installs?\r\n\r\nWe could probably catch this scenario explicitly when it comes to connection objects passed into `run`. For example we could check if the type name of the connection argument matches, and if it does, but the type itself is still different, we could print a special error."
