      "With `r.now`, I'm not sure -- I'd say my main concern is with the time eventually getting rendered without a timezone and getting parsed as a localtime.  With `r.time(...)`, no.  There needs to be some way to construct at time-zone-less time, *if* we support that.  Which leads to the important question:  why is it possible to make times that have no time zone?\r\n"
