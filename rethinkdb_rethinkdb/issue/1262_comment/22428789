      "That's not what we're trying to preserve.  You just said the server doesn't do that.  And it shouldn't.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that might be wrong with the server's behavior is allowing time zone to be left in an unspecified state.  It maybe should specify the time zone to be \"-00:00\" (or \"+00:00\"?), and never allow nil timezones.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm asking is what's the behavior of coerce_to?  `r.now` should have a UTC timezone, no?"
