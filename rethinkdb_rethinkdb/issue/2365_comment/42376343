      "@pilwon -- it isn't intended behavior, the problem is that in a distributed system you sometimes have the same event happen in two places.  If two nodes in the cluster both create a table `test`, you end up with two tables named `test`, and you have to resolve the conflict in the web UI before you can access them in the drivers by writing `r.table('test')`.  The web UI needs to be able to deal with these conflicting tables, so it always refers to tables by their UUID, which is unique."
