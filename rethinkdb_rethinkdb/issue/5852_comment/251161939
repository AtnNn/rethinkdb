      "This has been a growing issue as we continue to scale our application. It's really hampering our ability to grow, which in turn makes RethinkDB a less viable solution in the long run.\r\n\r\nObviously the problem is within our network  conditions (thanks Level3), but having a better resilience to problems would be really nice. The real struggle is that this really prevents us from maintaining a 12-factor  app infrastructure with RethinkDB.\r\n\r\n-A long time RethinkDB fanboy"
