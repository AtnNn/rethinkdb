        "User @akuseru encountered kind of an oddity when writing filters on an array value:\nhttps://github.com/danielmewes/php-rql/issues/43\n\nHis query (in PHP) was equivalent to the following in JS:\n\n```\nr.db('cars').table('toyota').filter([r.row('years').contains(2009)])\n```\n\nand it always returned all rows, no matter how the `r.row('years').contains(2009)` would evaluate.\n\nI don't know if there is some syntactic sugar in filter that I'm not aware of, but I think filter called on an array should fail with a type error shouldn't it?\n"
