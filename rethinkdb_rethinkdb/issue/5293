        "You can currently run `table.orderBy({index: ...}).changes({includeInitial: true})`.\nThis is rather confusing, because the results will not actually be ordered. This query is equivalent to `table.between(r.minval, r.maxval, {index: ...}).changes({includeInitial: true})` and doesn't provide any ordering guarantees.\n\nThis has lead to some confusion (e.g. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5280#issuecomment-171892241 recently), especially because the non-orderedness is not always obvious when looking at the results.\n\nI think we should disallow `table.orderBy({index: ...}).changes()`.\n"
