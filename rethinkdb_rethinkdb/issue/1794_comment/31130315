      "what coffeemug is suggesting is like the mongo short hand, and i personally think it would be great if you guys supported both.\r\n\r\n> What is {\"foo : \"bar\", \"fizz\" : \"buzz\"} equivalent to?\r\n\r\nis that your data or your accessor? it doesn't really make sense if that is what your data looks like so assuming it's your accessor then your data would look like:\r\n\r\n    {\"foo\": {\"bar\": \"some value\", ...}, \"fizz\": {\"buzz\": \"some other value\", ...}, ...}\r\n\r\nsaying you want to join on {\"foo : \"bar\", \"fizz\" : \"buzz\"} would mean that docs from both tables would be joined when they have equivalent values for the bar attribute of the foo object and the buzz attribute of the fizz object.\r\n\r\nat least that's what it would mean in mongo.\r\n\r\nnot that mongo is the right way to do things. but it is pretty widely used and people are familiar with it so it could end up being beneficial."
