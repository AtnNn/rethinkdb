      "@coffeemug: Thanks for chiming in. I had also talked to @srh about this yesterday and I'm halfway into believing that our code does handle the underfull btree correctly. It still seems like bugs might sneak in very easily.\r\nMaybe I should just write a few additional unit tests to verify that our code works reliably with such semi-btrees...\r\n\r\nThere is also new evidence now that the issue in #2015 has nothing to do with this, but is indeed a problem with either the cache or how we interact with it.\r\n\r\nI'm removing the 'tp:bug' tag, and keep this as 'tp:hygiene'..."
