      "Here's a more actual problem: Both secondary index deletion as well as the case where a replica ceases to be a replica use erase_range to delete the now unneeded data.\r\n\r\nHowever they don't consider that erase_range isn't actually going to delete *anything* unless there are large values (and in the case of secondary indexes is generally a no-op except for detaching blocks). All the internal nodes and leaf nodes of the btree are staying around.\r\n\r\nDeleting a secondary index never frees up space but just leaves loads of orphaned blocks around."
