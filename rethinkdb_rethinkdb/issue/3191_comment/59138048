      "Just did a very quick test on `v1.15.x` and could not reproduce it:\r\n```\r\n./rethinkdb -o 23 --bind all -d data23 &\r\n./rethinkdb proxy -o 24 --bind all -j localhost:29038 &\r\nls  # note that the proxy instance doesn't create any data directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe web UI shows only one server. This also still works after creating a table.\r\n\r\nThere must be something more to the issue that I didn't reproduce."
