      "Well... it's kind of hard to have a stack trace for a hang without going in and trying to figure which coroutines are hanging on which ones. And figuring out which coroutines are important to the hang and which ones are unrelated. So the people might have to make their own stack traces on this one. There's also a good chance that I turn out to be the people on this one."
