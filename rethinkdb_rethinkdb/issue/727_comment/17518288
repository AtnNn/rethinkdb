      "Not sure if it helps at all, but I have a set of cluster files that seems to consistently hang on startup.  I shut it down during an earlier hang in resharding, and now every time I start up the cluster again, it hangs while trying to backfill shards.  If you want to check it out, copy the files from ~grey/issue_727 on newton."
