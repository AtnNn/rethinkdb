      "There is a bug somewhere.\r\n\r\nnpm uses the node-semver package, which is based on [semver](https://github.com/isaacs/semver/blob/master/semver.md), which says that:\r\n\r\n> A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version.\r\n\r\n> A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version.\r\n\r\nHowever the [npm docs](https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html) contradict it:\r\n\r\n> A numeric item separated from the main three-number version by a hyphen will be interpreted as a \"build\" number, and will increase the version. But, if the tag is not a number separated by a hyphen, then it's treated as a pre-release tag, and is less than the version without a tag. So, 0.1.2-7 > 0.1.2-7-beta > 0.1.2-6 > 0.1.2 > 0.1.2beta\r\n\r\nBut the semver implementation has a completely different ordering for these versions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ semver -r '>0.1.2' 0.1.2-6\r\n# no\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nsemver -r '<0.1.2-beta' 0.1.2-7\r\n# yes\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd like you've observed, '>=17.0' does not work.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ semver -r '>=1.7.0' 1.7.0-1\r\n# no\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut neither does '<1.7.0'.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ semver -r '<1.7.0' 1.7.0-1\r\n# no\r\n```"
