      "Can we fix this by changing our versioning scheme to `1.7.0.1`?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sat, Jul 27, 2013 at 12:19 AM, Etienne Laurin\r\n<notifications@github.com>wrote:\r\n\r\n> There is a bug somewhere.\r\n>\r\n> npm uses the node-semver package, which is based on semver<https://github.com/isaacs/semver/blob/master/semver.md>,\r\n> which says that:\r\n>\r\n> A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of\r\n> dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version.\r\n>\r\n> A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and might not\r\n> satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its\r\n> associated normal version.\r\n>\r\n> However the npm docs <https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html> contradict it:\r\n>\r\n> A numeric item separated from the main three-number version by a hyphen\r\n> will be interpreted as a \"build\" number, and will increase the version.\r\n> But, if the tag is not a number separated by a hyphen, then it's treated as\r\n> a pre-release tag, and is less than the version without a tag.
