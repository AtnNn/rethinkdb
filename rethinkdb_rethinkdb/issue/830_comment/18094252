      "Hello Nick,\r\n\r\nNow what we consider as a read query is ONLY a query using `.get()`. We haven't agree yet on what to report for a query like `r.db('foo').table('bar').run()` -- Should we report 1 or the number of documents in the table?\r\n\r\nIf you have any thought about what you expect, I would __love__ to hear it.\r\n\r\nThere is an issue related to this, see issue #660.  It seems like this bug was pushed in backlog. I will move it 1.6.\r\n\r\nI will close this issue since it's a duplicate of #660, but don't worry, we'll fix it.\r\nAgain, thank you for reporting it!"
