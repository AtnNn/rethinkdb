      "The Ruby driver tries to convert the keys of an object to a string by calling `to_s`.  So `:a` turns into `\"a\"` and `1` turns into `\"1\"`.  Anything that doesn't support `to_s` will raise the appropriate exception.  (We might want more restrictive behavior here; what to you think @coffeemug?)"
