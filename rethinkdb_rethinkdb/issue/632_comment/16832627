      "Here's what I think we should do:\r\n\r\n1. Be restrictive. Only allow strings (and symbols in Ruby). If we want to be less restrictive later, we can be, but I suspect just doing strings and symbols will be ok for 99% of the users. The real problem is a confusing error message, not inability to serialize numbers by default.\r\n2. The error message should be `Document keys must be strings.` In ruby it should be `Document keys must be strings or symbols.` The word \"RQL\" is superficial and self-serving in the error message.\r\n"
