      "I think we're all in agreement for strings, symbols, and complicated objects like arrays.  I think the only real sticking point is numbers.\r\n\r\nIn Ruby, at least, the JSON serializer will coerce your numbers to a string for you:\r\n```ruby\r\nirb(main):374:0> {1 => 2}.to_json\r\n\"{\\\"1\\\":2}\"                      \r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the question here is what violates the user's expectations the least.  I think mimicking the native JSON parser is probably a good idea.  Or maybe not."
