      "JavaScript automatically converts integer object keys to strings. There is nothing we can do to disallow this.\r\n\r\nI talked to @coffeemug and we agreed that the error message should be \"Object keys must be strings\". The type that in various languages is referred to as a map, a hash, an object, or a document, is definitively called an object in RQL and we should stick to that terminology."
