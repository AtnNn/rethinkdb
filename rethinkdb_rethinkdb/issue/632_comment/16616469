      "The RQL protobuf spec only supports string key values for RQL objects. Both Python and JavaScript support integer values for dictionary keys (as well as other types). This particular error comes from the unusual way we used to pass python dictionaries to get serialized. The error now crops up in a different place.\r\n\r\nWe should add a check for the type of the key when creating a RQL object in the driver. The error message I've put into the Python driver is \"RQL object keys must be strings.\". I'll add a similar check and error message to the JS driver when I get a chance.\r\n\r\n@mlucy Is this a problem in the Ruby driver?"
