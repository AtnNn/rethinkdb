      "I'll have to disagree. RethinkDB is a JSON database. We chose to use as an **internal** representation protobufs, but it could be anything else. The internal representation should never leak to the users.\r\n\r\nThe borders of the systems/the parts the users interact with are JSON. Whatever internal representation we are using internally must be an overset of JSON that preserves the characteristics of it. "
