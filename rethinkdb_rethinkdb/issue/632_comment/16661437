      "@mlucy while at first the automatic conversion to strings might seem friendly to users, I think it is dangerous as it's a one-way silent type conversion. \r\n\r\nI've been thinking lately about what can we do about it and here're my thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. with the default json serializer we should follow the strict rules of JSON. That means raising if keys are not strings.\r\n2. allow users to configure the driver with their custom json serializer.\r\n\r\nAnd separately we should also support https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/252"
