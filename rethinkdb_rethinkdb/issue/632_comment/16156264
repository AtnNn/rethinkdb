      "@coffeemug I think that if you have a string that is not utf8 encoded this will fail with a similar error. But I cannot test this right now.\r\n\r\nI also think that we might want to consider adding an option to insert an already serialized object. The reason is that this feature would allow an user to use their own custom JSON serializer. Right now there's no easy way to hook into the serialization and have it customized. (a very quick example is serializing dates which right now would require one to have the same code duplicated over and over again instead of specifying a custom JSON serializer that knows how to deal with dates)"
