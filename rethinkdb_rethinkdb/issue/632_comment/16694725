      "Even if many JSON implementations automatically serialize numbers, I don't think we can rely on different implementations to all serialize numbers to strings in the same way. Does the JSON spec (insofar as there is one) even specify this? Will it even work the same way in 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the same JSON implementation?\r\n\r\nMore generally, while for now we may support something very similar to JSON we're only going to diverge further and further from this. I would hesitate to describe what we support as JSON. Where JSON is ambiguous (automatic string conversion for example) we need to be strict. Where JSON is too limited (no integers) we need more features. The longer we pretend to support JSON the more confused users will be when we inevitably have to change the documentation."
