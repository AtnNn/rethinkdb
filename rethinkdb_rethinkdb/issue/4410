        "I keep running into situations where I'm trying to do a bulk update and want to make sure that no new documents are inserted. The only way I can think to do this is pretty janky and requires at least two operations.\r\n\r\nThe documents I'm \"inserting\" already have primary keys, they just aren't guaranteed to already exist in the table. In cases like this specifying behavior when there is no conflict (ex. `no_conflict: error|ignore`) would be useful.\r\n\r\nI can see how it might be confusing to essentially have update-only operations on `.insert()`, but given how `table.update()` works I can't think of a better place for it."
