        "Currently, if there is a conflicted auth_key, it will show up in the web UI, but it is not resolvable, and the wording is strange.  This is mostly because the auth_key does not have an associated UUID, so a nil UUID is provided in the issue.\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve auth_key, the path is slightly different from cluster metadata, but everything *should* be hooked up at the server level to resolve with a post to `/ajax/auth/auth_key/resolve`, but I can't tell at the moment."
