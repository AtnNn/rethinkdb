        "In https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3550 we changed the format for sindex key serialization.  We probably need to add code to correctly handle old keys as well, even though we're going to require people to migrate.\r\n\r\nA list of things off the top of my head:\r\n* [ ] Check that range operations on sindexes are still correct (they might be correct without any changes because of the way we changed the serialization, or they might require branching based on the ReQL version).\r\n* [ ] Make sure that functions which parse the primary key out of the secondary key branch based on the ReQL version.\r\n* [ ] Make sure that we use the old serialization when writing a key to an outdated index."
