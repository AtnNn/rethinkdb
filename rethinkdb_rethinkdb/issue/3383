        "Hi, I'm fiddling with RethinkDB using the Twitter API, and am not able to figure out how to convert a time string like `\"2012-04-18 05:54:20 +0000\"` into a native RethinkDB time object. An example object:\n\n``` json\n{\n\"source\":  \"<a href='http://twitter.com' rel='nofollow'>Twitter Web Client</a>\" ,\n\"text\":  \"Every night I lie down on my Time Machine and travel 9 hours forward in time.\" ,\n\"timestamp\":  \"2012-04-18 05:54:20 +0000\" ,\n\"tweet_id\":  \"192491232159727616\"\n} \n```\n\nI went through the docs and searched online, but can't find a way to do it using ReQL. In this particular doc: http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/dates-and-times/ I see that the output of `R.now()` stringified is of the same format that I want to convert, but I'm unable to figure out how to convert it.\n"
