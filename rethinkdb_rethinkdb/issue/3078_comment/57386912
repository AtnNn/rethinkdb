      "Following the discussion in #3040, I think we should decide whether something is a \"notice\" or \"info\" by considering whether the user wants to see it on the console or not. So most of the messages that RethinkDB prints at startup should be \"notice\", but the error messages for bad HTTP input should be \"info\" (or maybe \"warning\")."
