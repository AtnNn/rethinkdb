      "Hi @sturmer. Your changes are mostly in line with what I was thinking of, but there are a few things I would do differently:\r\n\r\n* The `Listening for intracluster connections`, `Listening for administrative HTTP connections`, and `Listening for client driver connections` messages should definitely be `logNTC`. These are very useful for users who are running RethinkDB manually to see what ports RethinkDB is using.\r\n\r\n* The sequence of three messages starting with `To fully expose RethinkDB` should probably be `logNTC`.\r\n\r\n* `Loading data from directory` and `Initializing directory` should probably be `logNTC`.\r\n\r\n* Maybe the `Connected to server` and `Disconnected from server` and `Connected to proxy` and `Disconnected from proxy` messages should be `logNTC`. See discussion in #3040 again.\r\n"
