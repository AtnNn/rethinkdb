      "Hi @timmaxw, I made another iteration over the code after your comments. About `notice:`, I tweaked the test that is done when writing a label before the message itself (the `prepend` variable, see commit fa54664).\r\n\r\nRe: the separation between info and notice levels, I've tried to separate them with the criteria shown in the [Wikipedia entry for syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) (see commit 7b8c3ee).\r\n\r\nAny comments are welcome, as usual."
