        "We switched to requiring `--bind [network adapter]` or --bind `all`, and instead by default only allow connections via localhost.\n\nRight now the startup message looks like this if you start with just `rethinkdb` on OS X:\n\n```\ndr-manhattan:~ michael$ rethinkdb\ninfo: Running rethinkdb 1.3.2 (CLANG 4.1 ((tags/Apple/clang-421.11.66)))...\ninfo: Loading data from directory rethinkdb_data\ninfo: Listening on addresses (add more using '--bind'): 127.0.0.1.\ninfo: Listening for intracluster connections on port 29015.\ninfo: Listening for client driver connections on port 28015.\ninfo: Listening for administrative HTTP connections on port 8080.\ninfo: Server ready\n```\n\nIt's pretty clear if you read the startup messages line by line that you have to use `--bind` to add more addresses. However, this was a sudden and recent addition, so I didn't see the change on line 4. My next step was to type `rethinkdb --help`, but its output wasn't very helpful (see #245). I ultimately ended up finding my answer in the [cluster setup guide](http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guides/startup/)-- use `--bind all`.\n\nI would normally dismiss this as my failing to not read the output carefully, but I think this merits a bit more thought:\n- This is an experience that affects a lot of users when they first start using RethinkDB. All of our guides, etc. indicate that you should visit http://[hostname]:[ip listed in the output of `rethinkdb`] to see the admin tool. This is not the experience if they install it on a remote machine, and is not documented clearly.\n- Apparently I'm not the only one who had this problem, except in the context of the init script: http://c2journal.com/2012/12/06/rethinkdb-nightmare-1-service-wont-start/\n"
