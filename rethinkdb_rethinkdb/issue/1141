        "Hey guys, updating the CL driver for 1.7...just wanted to mention that `return_vals` isn't documented as an available OPTARG in ql2.proto for UPDATE. I usually do all driver updates by looking at the diff between my previous `ql2.proto` and the new one, so it threw me off for a sec.\n\nAlso, I noticed PLUCK didn't get any ql2.proto updates despite that it now allows objects as well as strings...what RQL types are safe to pass to the new PLUCK?\n\nLooks like I should have the new 1.7 version out tonight! Thanks for the hard work.\n"
