        "Hi,\n\nI have the following query:\n\n``` javascript\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"customers\").getAll(\"1\", \"2\", {index: \"resellerId\"})\n```\n\nI want to do the same with the Java Driver:\n\n``` groovy\nr.table(\"customers\").getAll(reseller.toArray(), r.hashMap(\"index\", \"resellerId\")).run(dbConn)\n```\n\nWhich always results in the error message:\n\n> Primary keys must be either a number, string, bool, pseudotype or array (got type OBJECT):\\n{\\n\\t\\\"index\\\":\\t\\\"resellerId\\\"\\n}\n\nEven if I try the following:\n\n``` groovy\nr.table(\"customers\").getAll(\"1\", \"2\", r.hashMap(\"index\", \"resellerId\")).run(dbConn)\n```\n\nDoesn't the Java Driver Support selecting secondary indices on `getAll`? Or is there something wrong with how I build the `{index: \"resellerId\"}` parameter?\n"
