        "There are some bugs that happen intermittently on Travis that make the CI process less useful than it could be. For example, the polyglot cursor tests occasionally fail with an out-of-memory error, there are occasional forking errors, etc.\r\n\r\nFixing these bugs is often difficult and is more trouble than it's worth. I propose whitelisting these errors, reporting the offending tests in yellow, but passing them anyway. This way we don't have to bother with fixing things that aren't our fault only to make the tests pass. If the tests fail for legit (non-whitelisted) reasons, the suite will still fail. It seems like a simple solution that will get us 99% of what we want with 10% of the work."
