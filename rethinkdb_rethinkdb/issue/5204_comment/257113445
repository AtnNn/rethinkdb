      "To get queries like this working I had to mirror rethinkdb vs elasticsearch and got me some speed \128077  \r\n\r\nI could do this permanently and forget about this problem for a while, however not having reliable changefeeds is also a killer :|\r\n\r\nTo work around its only by usign two secondary indexes then the performance is better, actually is the only way to get any query some speed after some millions.\r\n\r\nCheers."
