      "> Maybe we could install a signal handler that checks whether we got a stack overflow on a ReQL coroutine, and produces an `exc_t` if we did?\r\n\r\nWe also had the idea of installing a signal handler and extending the stack by reallocing. We never got around to doing this though (it's also debatable if it's a good idea because of potential performance issues associated with copying large stacks)."
