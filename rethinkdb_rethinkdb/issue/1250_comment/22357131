      "Yeah, and we hit this problem because a chunk of code was allocating 5 KB per stack frame. Granted this is only in debug mode but if something were doing this in release I'd rather blow a call stack and learn about it than have this much bloat hanging around.\r\n\r\nAlso another thought, I think it might be reasonable to install a signal handler during reql evaluation because it's hard to control stack size while evaluating a user's code. However if I understand correctly this is an issue that pops up during reql compilation not execution. And I really think we should be able to write compilation code that doesn't blow the stack without changing our coro engine. We've had to deal with this at other points in the code but it's ultimately led to much tighter code and I think we should do that here."
