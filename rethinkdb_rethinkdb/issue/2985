        "`datum_t` currently has operators for dereferencing it and supports being empty. This was to make it easier to convert from `counted_t<const datum_t>` to `datum_t`. Basically, `datum_t` can be used as if it was a `counted_t<const datum_t>`.\n- Remove the pointer dereference operators from `datum_t`\n- Remove the option for a `datum_t` to be uninitialized. Places that use that feature can use a `boost::option` instead.\n\nI would like to do this as soon as possible, but it's not a release blocker for 1.15.\n"
