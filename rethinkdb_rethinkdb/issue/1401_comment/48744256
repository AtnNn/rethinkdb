      "@coffeemug\r\n\r\nThat's brilliant! Thanks! During the time being, Redis added HyperLogLog, another cool use of bitwise operations.\r\n\r\nA side note, please make sure the bitwise operations apply to **Binary** data types as well, MySQL, MongoDB limits that to maximum 64-bit integers only, which is a shame."
