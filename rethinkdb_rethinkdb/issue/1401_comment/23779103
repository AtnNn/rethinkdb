      "Hi @est -- thanks for submitting this. We're currently in the middle of performance and scalability work (in preparation for shipping a production-ready release of RethinkDB), so this will have to wait. Once the production-ready release is out, we'll follow up with some additions to ReQL. We definitely considered bitwise ops and binary data types (though I have no ETA for now).\r\n\r\nMoving to backlog for the time being."
