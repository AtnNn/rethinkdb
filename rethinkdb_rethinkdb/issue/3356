(So that it returns just story 1).\r\n\r\nThis is required in the general case of filtering items by more than one tag.\r\n\r\nAs answered by AtnNn in the SO question, workarounds include not using any index and creating a 'powerset' index (which could become pretty large).\r\n\r\nThe best solution however is if RethinkDB could use the already created tags multi index for this / or there should be some other way to create an efficient index for this requirement.\r\n\r\nOr maybe instead of the server merging (union-ing) the results of getAll for each tag in\r\n```\r\n     r.table('story').getAll('plants', 'dogs', {index: tags})\r\n```\r\nthere could be an option to tell the server to 'intersect' the results instead."
