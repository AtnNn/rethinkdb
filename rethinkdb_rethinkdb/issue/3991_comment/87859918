      "Thanks for reporting this @Zolmeister .\r\nHow consistent is this if you run the query multiple times? Do you get the same difference in runtime if `array1` and `array2` are empty?\r\nHow many entries did they previously have?\r\n\r\nI find it pretty hard do imagine that the append operation itself could make a difference of 36ms. So I wonder if one of them just happened to go over some size boundary (e.g. the btree inline value size) making the disk write slower."
