        "Right now we have icons pulling double duty in the ui, including some that make no sense at all, and aren't used consistently.\n\nSome examples that stick out to me that are currently inconsistent:\n- primary and secondary replica icons are completely unrelated (used on the table page)\n- The table list and server list both use the \"stacked sheets of paper\" icon\n- Shards/replicas in the table list uses a little line graph\n- The \"tables x/y ready\" monitor at the top uses an ekg line to represent tables\n- If you thought that was ok because it meant tables ready, right next to it the servers connected uses the standard database icon\n- Uptime on the server page uses the \"replica\" icon\n- Hostname on the server page uses the \"document\" icon\n- Version on the server page uses the \"stacks of paper\" icon we use kind of everywhere\n- Shards on the server page use the same icon used on the table and server listing pages. (Is this the generic \"thing in a list\" icon?)\n\nI'm proposing creating a 1-1 mapping to icons for these concepts that are used multiple times in the ui:\n- Server\n- Shard\n- Replica\n- Primary replica\n- Secondary replica\n- Database\n- Table\n- Document\n\nAdditionally, we could create icons for `hostname`, `uptime`, and `version`, or we could just drop the icon for those.\n\nIdeally, we would re-appropriate the icons we have that makes sense, and use them consistently, and create new icons where necessary. Also ideally, we would do them in svg so we can style them differently in different parts of the ui. \n"
