        "I looked into my other processes using \"/proc/xxxx/limits\" and they all have the correct limit but rethink db has its limit set to 4k, im needing to handle way more than 4k connections. I have been trying to fix this issue for weeks and cannot seem to find a solution!\r\n\r\nI am using connection pooling, all my file limits are set to over a million every process on my system is using the new limits besides rethinkdb.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hMEup6m.png \r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5QUoYXE.png \r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dIQRTEu.png \r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/D9t2Blq.png\r\n\r\nAs you see i even tried to enforce the limit specifically on rethinkdb with nothing working.
