      "This may not be directly related, but a similar problem can now be seen using `test/interface/shard_fuzzer.py`.  The test constructs 6 tables with different order-of-magnitude sizes, although still fairly small.  These tables are randomly and repeatedly resharded and rebalanced across a cluster of 4 servers.  These reconfigurations happen quickly at first, but slow down significantly over time.  After two minutes of this, it is not uncommon for a table to take more than 30 seconds to become available."
