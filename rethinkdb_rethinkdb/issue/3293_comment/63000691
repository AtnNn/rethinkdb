      "In the above tests, the tables are going from (1 shard, 1 replica) to (2 shards, 2 replicas). This means that we have to create 20 new data files. I also tried an experiment going from (2 shards, 1 replica) to (2 shards, 2 replicas). This means that all the data files are created at the beginning and not during reconfiguration. This gives the following results in release mode:\r\n```\r\nSpinning up two processes...\r\nCreated db: 0.007018 s\r\nCreated 20 tables: 16.830278 s\r\nInserted rows: 1.755637 s\r\nReconfigured: 0.345574 s\r\nTables ready: 6.170476 s\r\nDone.\r\n```"
