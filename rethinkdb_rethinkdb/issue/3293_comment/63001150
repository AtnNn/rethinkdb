      "However, it still takes linear time. Here's the same scenario with 40 tables:\r\n```\r\nSpinning up two processes...\r\nCreated db: 0.002710 s\r\nCreated 40 tables: 33.373775 s\r\nInserted rows: 3.349247 s\r\nReconfigured: 1.128764 s\r\nTables ready: 15.117938 s\r\nDone.\r\n```\r\nI suspect that backfill throttling might be the problem. Even if there isn't any data being backfilled, ~0.5s per backfill seems reasonable for the time necessary to create data files, perform the backfill handshake, etc."
