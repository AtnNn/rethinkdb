      "Hey @hungte, thanks for the great work here. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this issue is FreeBSD specific or not but it fails for me due to a missing directory (drivers/javascript/build). Creating it manually first solves the issue and I have it compiling successfully on 9.1.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Actually, just building again for a local Vagrant box and remembered some additional steps I needed, I had to symlink /usr/local/bin/bash to /bin/bash and use `--lib-path /usr/local/lib`"
