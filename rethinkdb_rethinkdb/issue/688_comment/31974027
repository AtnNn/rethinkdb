      "I merged next into @atnnn's freebsd branch. If I compile in release mode, there now is a problem with hostname lookup. This is probably because a lot of that code has changed, and needs to be adapted to FreeBSD.\r\nIf I compile in debug mode, a newly created table never becomes available. I think this might have to do with the changed message hub, but that's just a hypothesis."
