      "The Travis failure seems not related to this patch since other people are seeing same failure.\r\n\r\nUpdated some build env changes so that LIBRARY_PATHS and -I/usr/local/include -D__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS are no longer required.\r\n\r\nStep to test updated in commit 1539e00 description. Note there is no freebsd \"ports\" yet, so you still need to manually install all dependency stuff, or using precompiled web assets (which is a lot easier)"
