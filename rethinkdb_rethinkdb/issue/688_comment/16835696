      "@hungte -- wow, this rocks! Thank you for the contribution!\r\n\r\n@atnnn, @al3xandru -- if this makes it into 1.5, we should * definitely* add docs for it, and point it out in the changelog and announcement. I'm slating it for 1.5 for now, feel free to take out if it doesn't make it (but pretty please, could it make it? :-D)"
