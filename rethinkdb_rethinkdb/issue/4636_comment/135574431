      "This is pretty minor, but could we have the server automatically coerce the `name` argument to a string? As @captainpete's motivation for this PR implies, `r.uuid(<array>)` and `r.uuid(<object>)` are probably the cases where this feature becomes most useful, so not having to chain that extra `.coerceTo('string')` on the argument would be great!"
