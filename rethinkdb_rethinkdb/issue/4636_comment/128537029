      "Thanks for the pull request @captainpete !\r\n\r\nTagging this as a ReQL proposal since it changes the API and putting it into 2.2 since so many people seem to want it.  Generally the way we handle API changes is we have a discussion period at the start of every release (to avoid distracting people in the middle of a release)."
