      "Having the driver munging error messages seems bad.  What if someone has the string `non_atomic` as part of their primary key and we return a \"duplicate key\" error?  That would be super confusing.\r\n\r\nI think that if the `non_atomic` flag works, we should just leave the error message as-is."
