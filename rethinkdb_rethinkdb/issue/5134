        "I am using RethinkDB as hashmap where I replace a feature based on id. When I replace an existing feature with a geometry I noticed that this feature is maintained from my previous object. The geometry has a secondary index. I am using the statement below to update. When specifying geometery = None explictly in my new document the geometry is removed.\n\nEdit: I observe that this happens for all the attributes in my update. Not only geometry types. I consider this a serious issue.\n\nr.table('vehicles').insert(obj2, durability = 'soft', conflict = 'update').run()\n"
