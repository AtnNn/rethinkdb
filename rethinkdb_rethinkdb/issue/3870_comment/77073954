      "@mlucy and I discussed this in person. Options to consider:\r\n\r\n- Add a scrollbar regardless of the amount of vertical content across the UI -- this is subpar on some browsers, where the scrollbar is visually unappealing, unlike OS X.\r\n- Add a fourth column -- this may make the suggestion box too large.\r\n- Compact the visual space each term takes up -- there's a lot of horizontal and vertical space padding.\r\n- Move the syntax description box to the left or right of the suggestion box, rather than below -- we're have to detect how much horizontal space is available on either side to choose where to display it, and would cause a problem on small displays.\r\n- Add some content below the Data Explorer, maybe explaining how to use the Data Explorer. This issue only shows up when you first load the DE and haven't entered a query.\r\n\r\nI'd like to think about a few other options for this.\r\n"
