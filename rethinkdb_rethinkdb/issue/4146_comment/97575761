      "Looking at the code we have `compute_keys` in btree.cc which loops over each key datum and calls `print_secondary` on it. `print_secondary` throws a ReQL exception if it encounters `null`, which aborts the whole process.\r\nMight be easiest to just check for null before calling that, since we currently use `null` as a kind of special value that means \"don't index this\"."
