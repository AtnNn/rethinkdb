      "> That's true right now as well.\r\n\r\nI suppose, but to a much lesser degree. Writing a really complicated function would be unobvious, you'd have to think about it a little to do it, and you'd most probably have to do it to screw with the system on purpose. With multiindexes writing a complicated function becomes much more natural as a solution to a problem.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is a difference between a complicated function that snowballs CPU time, and a complicated function that snowballs write throughput to disk. In this case, we're making the latter much, much easier."
