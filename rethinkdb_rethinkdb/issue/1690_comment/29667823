      "Does anyone have any feedback on this? I think it's thorny because a really large limit would mean a point write could have very unpredictable performance. Also, our array size limit is 100k, so a multiindex with a higher cap wouldn't be too useful (unless the user is doing something really wonky like creating a multiindex by concatenating arrays).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, 256 does seem ridiculously low.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"
