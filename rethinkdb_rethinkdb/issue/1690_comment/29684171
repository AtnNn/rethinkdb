      "Well, both the 256 limit, and the 100K limit (or 2^32, which basically 100K in practice) worry me. I think we should eventually test the performance implications before we settle on a final cap; until then I would suggest a more conservative limit like 10K.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if we pick a bad constant and it becomes an issue in practice we'll find out and fix it pretty easily, so I won't stand in the way of progress. Moving to 1.12."
