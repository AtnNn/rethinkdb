      "That's true right now as well.  We let people use arbitrarily complicated functions as secondary indexes.  If they choose an expensive function, inserting a single document will take a long time.  This change would just be adding another class of expensive function, and an especially useful class at that.  (Also, if somebody wants to have a multi-index on lots of keywords, their other option right now -- using a second table and inserting `n` elements into it for each insertion into the primary table -- is probably more expensive than the new option we'd be introducing.)"
