      "It would be cool to show info in the webUI about how many outstanding writes a table has. I'm pretty sure this is actually doable right now using the stats that exist so this could be a pretty easy fix that helps a bit in this department because you can at least see if tables have a lot of dirty blocks to flush. It's also just generally useful."
