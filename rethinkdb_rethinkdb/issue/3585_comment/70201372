      "I just reviewed the artificial table changefeed logic and confirmed that it should never call `ql::changefeed::artificial_t::send_all()` with a change where `change.old_val == change.new_val`. If it does, there's a bug, and tripping a guarantee is appropriate. Do you think that's adequate, or do you have an idea for how to write a test for this?"
