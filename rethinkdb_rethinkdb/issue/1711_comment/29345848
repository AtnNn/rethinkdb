      "Moving this to 1.12 and assigning to myself.  I'm leery of having tests that occasionally fail, because if you have even just a handful of those then nobody trusts the tests any more.  I think that we should either make this sindex creation take long enough that the timing is never wrong (2s should be pretty safe?) or we should put it into a group of tests that are known to be flaky and don't run by default."
