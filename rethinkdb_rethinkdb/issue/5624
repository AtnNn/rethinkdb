Error: %d format: a number is required, not str\r\nError: rethinkdb-export failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it says \"Could not connect to ...\", but doesn't print the reason for the connection failure. Additionally it prints a second error when trying to parse the version (it should bail out before even trying to parse it if it can't connect)."
