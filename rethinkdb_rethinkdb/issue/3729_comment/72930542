      "Thank you for the bug report @nuin. We've rewritten big parts of the web UI in 1.16, so this is probably a bug in the web UI that has slipped through the cracks.\r\n\r\nCould you do two things for us to help us figure out what's going on?\r\n- Check the development console if there are any JavaScript errors. In Firefox you can enable the \"Web Console\" in the Tools -> Web Developer sub menu. There will probably be a couple of CSS warnings already in there. The interesting ones are JS and Logging messages. In Chrome/Chromium I think JS errors show up on the \"JavaScript console\", which you can find in the Tools menu.\r\n- Could you run `r.db('genes').table('exons3').info()` in the Data Explorer and report back the result?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!"
