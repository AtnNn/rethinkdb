      "@nuin It should be using the same port (8080) for all of its requests (and the same local server), so if there was a problem with that I would expect the web UI to not work at all. Theoretically there's a chance that something is special with this specific request (e.g. it takes longer than the others or something like that) which causes it to be interrupted by the firewall, but I don't think that's very likely."
