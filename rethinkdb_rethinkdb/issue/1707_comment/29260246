      "As of now you can do the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nr.table('foo').insert(QUERY_GOES_HERE).run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can export into CSV:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrethinkdb export ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose you want file access from ReQL directly, but unfortunately this doesn't make much sense since there is no guarantee about which node such an operation would run on in a cluster. This is an interesting idea though, I'd like to think about this a bit. It is somewhat related to #1383 in that it would be the first command to add a systems interface to ReQL. "
