      "Hi @alexeygolev, are you getting any error message?\r\n\r\n15,323 objects should normally be fine. There's a limit at 100,000 which can be changed through the `arrayLimit` argument to `run` (see http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/run/ ). Since your seem to be hitting a limit much earlier, I suspect that there's something else going on (could be an issue with our JavaScript driver)."
