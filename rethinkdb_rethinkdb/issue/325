        "Currently our `zip` operator has two flaws:\r\n\r\n1. It's different from what one would expect `zip` to be (which is described in #324)\r\n2. It's very oddly specific in that it hardcodes `left` and `right`.\r\n\r\nHere's what I think we should do:\r\n\r\n1. Rename `zip` to `flatten`\r\n2. Generalize it so that it can do more arbitrary object flattening:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.expr({ left: {a : 1}, right: { b: 2}}).flatten('left', 'right') ==> { a: 1, b: 2 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generalization should also account for nested objects, so we should probably wait until we work out `pluck` before we do this."
