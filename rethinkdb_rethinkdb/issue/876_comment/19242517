      "I know we're not discussing this, but I'd like to write this down to make sure I don't forget. I propose `distinct(x, y)` to act slightly differently than `pluck(x, y).distinct()`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n> r([{:a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3 }, {:a => 1, :b => 3}]).distinct(:a).run\r\n[{:a => 1, :rest => [{:b => 2, :c => 3}, {:b => 3}]}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, it groups everything into distinct groups of values for :a, and rolls everything else up into an array. I'm not sure about the `rest` thing, but I don't have a better proposal for the time being. We should consider this when we get to this."
