      "I like `server_unreachable`, because it states the problem from the perspective of the server you've connected to, as opposed to defining its state (e.g. if you have a netsplit, both sides will say `server_down`, even if both servers are up and running).\r\n\r\n:+1: to @VeXocide's suggestion."
