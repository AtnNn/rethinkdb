        "@atnnn is working on resurrecting integration tests. We'll do this in small checkpoints so it doesn't turn into a long, arduous project. For this issue, we'll do the following:\n- Port the bitrotted stress client to work with next\n- Make sure all the integration tests consistently pass (if we can't make something pass, we'll make fix them part of a different issue)\n- Put the state of tests on the team dashboard (@mglukhovsky will have to do a little bit for that to happen)\n"
