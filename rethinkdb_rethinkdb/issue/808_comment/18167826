      "Thank you @atnnn. That looks like it was even easier than I was expecting.\r\n\r\n@al3xandru I'd like to clarify my statement. I agree that it is certainly is worth the time to have good docs. What isn't worth the time is rewriting python specific documentation to the neglect of our cross driver docs. Now that @atnnn has shown how easy it is to integrate our existing docs into Python's native documentation system we can focus on making our existing docs better to the benefit of all three drivers and the website."
