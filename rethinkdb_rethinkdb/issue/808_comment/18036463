      "Writing good docs is hard and takes time. If our existing docs are very good then it's because we haven't put the time into writing very good documentation not because the system we built isn't capable of supporting well written documentation.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree that it would be nice to support tooltip docs integration in bpython (similar to how we currently support inline docs in the data explorer) it's certainly not necessary. It we can integrate the current documentation into the pydoc system automatically then let's go for it, but it is definitely not worth the time to write python specific docs and javascript specific docs and ruby specific docs. Maintaining consistency between 3 separate sets of documentation will be a nightmare. Let's put that time into writing really good docs for the current system that apply across all three drivers."
