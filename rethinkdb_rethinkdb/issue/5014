        "There are many polyglot yaml tests that contain usages of r.row but that aren't directly attempting to test the r.row term itself. It's convenient because the same syntax can be used for both javascript and python tests, without having to specify them independently.\n\nUnfortunately, it's pretty difficult to do an ast transformation from a python test that uses r.row to a python ast that uses a lambda. This limits the ability to translate the python tests to other languages like Java/C# that don't implement r.row. It's possible, but would be pretty nasty code and it would probably be easier to just rewrite the ~90 or so tests that use it currently.\n\nObviously, some tests would actually be for the r.row term itself, and those shouldn't be rewritten to use lambdas.\n\nI added the Java tag because this is blocking the Java driver from running the full battery of polyglot tests. It just skips any tests were r.row is used in any definition in the file, and this unfortunately skips a large number of perfectly reasonable tests that just happen to use r.row for convenience.\n"
