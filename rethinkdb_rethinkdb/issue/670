        "We now support soft durability via #207. It can be set via the web UI on table creation, and changed via the admin CLI. We should also add this setting to `table_create` in reql and all drivers. When people ask \"why is rethinkdb slower than mongo\", instead of telling them about the somewhat complicated CLI process, we'll just tell them \"run `table_create('foo', soft_durablity=true)`\", which is a much simpler thing to explain.\n\nAssigning to @mlucy, we should try and get this into 1.5.\n"
