      "Yup it's in next. I just tried testing the webUI and it still wasn't letting me make tables with names that only differed in capitalization. I tried to do `shift` + `f5` to clear the cache but it still didn't work. I'm betting that something weird is happening here, perhaps with the rebuilding of web assets. Can you confirm that this works in your tests?"
