        "I've read through #159 and #1208, and I'm still confused about current behavior, because it seems to contradict the resolutions in those bugs.\r\n\r\nSome background:\r\n\r\n* Rethink 1.10\r\n* Running on a relatively low-memory server (1gb ram)\r\n* one table, with an integer primary key (nonconsecutive) and very little additional data per document. I haven't lowered the cache size on table create.\r\n\r\nThe following I actually performed on my local machine (8gb ram) to make sure that memory wasn't an issue.\r\n\r\n`r.db('polyglots').table('users').count()` -> 2939900 documents\r\n\r\n\r\n`r.db('polyglots').table('users').orderBy(r.desc('id')).limit(5)` gives the following result:\r\n\r\n![screenshot 2013-10-09 15 13 30](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/22723/1297249/f8d90a4e-30dd-11e3-9055-47a8070b1dd6.png)\r\n\r\nAm I supposed to be able to do this now, and it's a bug? Or is the bottom line that I can't the entire dataset won't fit into memory?\r\n\r\n"
