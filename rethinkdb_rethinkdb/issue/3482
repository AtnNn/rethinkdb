        "@timmaxw and @VeXocide brought up that we should find a better structure for the protocol-specific btree code, and ideally define proper separation boundaries between the low-level btree code and the protocol-specific functionality.\r\n\r\nOne idea by @timmaxw was to split the store/btree code under `rdb_protocol` into a generic part plus one file per implementation of a given protocol-level operation (the individual variants of `read_t` and `write_t` basically)."
