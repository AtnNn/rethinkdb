      "If the `rethinkdb-export` script is not located in PATH, it can be invoked like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython -mrethinkdb._export\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't currently work for `rethinkdb-dump` because it looks for `rethinkdb-export` in PATH.\r\n\r\nThe dump script, the restore script and rethinkdb could try invoking the script with `python -m` when it is not found in PATH. If it did, less users would run into this problem and the error message may not have to be changed."
