      "This appears to work and all, but we seem to have a deployment problem on newton, where there are 4 versions of python installed (`2.6`, two `2.7`, and `3.2`), each in various states of disrepair.  This obviously complicates things, but I don't think that's something `rethinkdb` should have to worry about."
