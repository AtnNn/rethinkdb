      "Not necessarily. The dump/restore scripts are invoked by the main rethinkdb binary but (at least on Ubuntu) are installed in different locations: ```/usr/bin/rethinkdb``` and ```/usr/local/bin/rethinkdb-dump``` so even if the Python driver *is* installed correctly the invocation of the dump script can fail if ```/usr/local/bin``` is not in the path (when running a cron job for example) which therefore makes the hardcoded message confusing."
