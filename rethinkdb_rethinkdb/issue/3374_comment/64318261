      "@danielmewes thanks for your quick response! I've had an accident in the past where a logfile grew out of hand and caused a server to crash so I guess I'm (maybe too) attentive when it comes to logrotating. If there would be a default config somewhere on your site that follows best practices for logrotating RethinkDB, that would be great. I'm planning to use RethinkDB in production so I'm just trying to remove any obstacle that could make it go wrong.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"
