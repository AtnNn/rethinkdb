      "I think daemons like rethinkdb should not deal with log files other than by appending to a file or using syslog.\r\n\r\nIt might help users if there was some documentation on setting up tools such as logrotate.\r\n\r\nHow would truncating log files interfere with how logs are presented in the web ui and in the reql admin api?"
