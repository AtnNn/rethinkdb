      "@AtnNn \r\n> How would truncating log files interfere with how logs are presented in the web ui and in the reql admin api?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the current implementation. @timmaxw is going to begin work on https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2884 soon and we were actually discussing this question. There are still two options on the table as to what the exact behavior will be, but in either case we are going to handle truncation gracefully."
