      "I see, that makes sense.\r\nI don't think there's anything special to keep in mind for the configuration, apart from using `copytruncate`. Though I haven't tried it myself.\r\n\r\nAs you suggested, we should test how this works and provide an example logrotate file somewhere (either as part of the package, or on our website).\r\nSince the data directory depends on the user's configuration, and RethinkDB by default stores its log file there, it might be best to just provide a template with instructions on how to adapt and install it.\r\n\r\nPutting the issue into `subsequent`. I imagine this is going to be pretty straight-forward, so we can hopefully get it done soon (it's not a top priority right now though).\r\n\r\nAlso pinging @AtnNn"
