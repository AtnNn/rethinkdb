      "Hi @oliverlundquist , thank you for bringing this up.\r\n\r\nWe don't currently have good support for log rotation. It's usually not necessary, because the RethinkDB log file grows very slowly (unless something is wrong, and servers constantly lose connections or things like that).\r\n\r\nAs far as my understanding goes, just moving the log file is not enough. The RethinkDB server will still have the old log file open and will keep writing to it.\r\nYou would have to restart the server to make it use the new log file, which will come with a temporary loss of availability and cold cache.\r\n\r\nWe could potentially add a signal or something like that to tell the server to re-open the log file.\r\n\r\nHow important is log rotation for you? Out of interest: May I ask for which reasons you need it?"
