      "So, I'm working on a fix for this, but while investigating it, I found a bunch of other inconsistencies in how our drivers handle socket, protocol, and cursor errors.\r\n\r\nThis particular error appears to be caused by the client connection closing, followed by some bad logic with connection closing and cursor pre-buffering.  I'm testing with a server that closes the connection instantly after sending a reply, which results in various errors in the client driver, but I haven't reproduced your stack trace, @timjrobinson.  Regardless, errors *should* be appended to the end of the cursor, and should definitely not be uncaught on a socket read callback.  I'm currently going through all of our drivers to guarantee they have consistent behavior here, but it's taking some time."
