      "This is up in review 2283.  I made a number of changes to all the drivers to try and make them more consistent and handle errors better:\r\n\r\n* Added `is_open` to the `Connection` class in all the drivers (`isOpen` in js) - see #3213\r\n* Socket errors will now result in the connection closing\r\n* When a connection is closed, all waiting queries and cursors will receive a `RqlRuntimeError` with the message \"Connection is closed.\" - this may be due to an error, or the user running `Connection::close()`\r\n* When an error occurs on a Cursor, it should only be raised/returned to the user after all results that were successfully received.\r\n* Added new Cursor tests for Ruby and Python\r\n* The Python driver now has better handling for incomplete reads/writes\r\n* Fixed a few small, tangentially-related bugs in all the drivers and test scripts."
