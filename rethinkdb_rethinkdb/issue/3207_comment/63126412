      "The fixes have been merged to `next` as of abdebad.  Will be in release 1.16.  There are a lot of changes here that could have subtle consequences, so I'm not comfortable putting this in `1.15.x`.\r\n\r\n@timjrobinson, you generally shouldn't see this sort of error if the server problems are fixed.  Thanks for bringing this to our attention!"
