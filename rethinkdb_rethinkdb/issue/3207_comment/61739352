      "Note that a hacky/easy way to patch it is probably by just listening for errors on connection.\r\nThe error on `connection.rawSocket` is re-emitted on the connection, which if not handled will crash the process.\r\n\r\nOne more note to point out that adding a listener to a connection is appropriate. I believe if the server decides to abruptly abort the connection, it will also crash the process. The driver currently doesn't nicely propagate this error to the running queries."
