      "I was thinking of just having an opaque slug that map/merge/ etc accept. But I don't know how much work that would be in relation to actually implementing first class functions entirely. The difference is that a user still couldn't create and store their own functions in a variable, or pass them to other functions. If first class functions are already sort of there, but just disallowed by some check, then it's probably not a gain"
