      "@shinzui That depends on your particular use case. The easiest option is often to just implement the recursive part in your application code, and to fetch the data you need for evaluating it from RethinkDB.\r\nIn some cases, you can generate queries that emulate recursion up to a certain fixed depth by nesting `r.branch` commands. This is not always practical though, because the queries can quickly become extremely large (which has effects on their evaluation speed).\r\n\r\n@niieani There still isn't an ETA on this. I'll move this from backlog to `subsequent` and we can try to pick this up for one of the upcoming release cycles."
