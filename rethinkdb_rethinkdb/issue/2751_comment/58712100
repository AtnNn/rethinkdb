      "Also, I kind of like the interface for this. I think it fits really well into ReQL, and while \"least fixed-point\" and all that combinator math is confusing, the user doesn't actually deal with that. They just define a function that gets passed itself as its first argument. If you already get recursive functions, this isn't much of a leap beyond that"
