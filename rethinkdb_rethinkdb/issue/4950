        "The timestamps in the log file should have the timezone printed with each timestamp. This should probably be the current offset from UTC, so we can detect whether an entry is in daylight saving time or not.\r\n\r\nWe might be able to use ISO8601 timestamps, possibly slightly modified / enhanced to have a higher sub-second precision for our timestamps (since we require them to be unique).\r\n\r\nIdeally we'll do this in a way where our parser can distinguish between the old and new format, so that old log files can still be parsed."
