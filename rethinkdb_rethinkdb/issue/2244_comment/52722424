      "In CR 1987 by @mlucy.\r\nThis implementation has 0 pointer indirections for bool and num, and also reduces the number of indirections by 1 for arrays and objects. It does not reduce the number of indirections for strings, because I changed how `wire_string_t`s work in preparation for #1915 (which now have an additional pointer indirection compared to before)."
