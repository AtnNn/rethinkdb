      "> No. That would be surprising.\r\n\r\nWhat would be surprising in terms of the interface?\r\n\r\n> RethinkDB runs on 32-bit systems. Generally speaking if you want to tag a pointer you do it on the least significant bits.\r\n\r\nOn a 32-bit system you would just use a 32-bit tag outside the pointer and it wouldn't take up any more space than a pointer on a 64-bit system.\r\n\r\nTagging a pointer in the lower bits only works if you have a small number of types you want to distinguish, and we'd want this variant to support lots.  Tagging in the upper bits on 64-bit systems works well to avoid the memory overhead of using more bits for your pointer than you actually need."
