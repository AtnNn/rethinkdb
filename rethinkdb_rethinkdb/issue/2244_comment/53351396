      "A few more changes to the `datum_t` interface that are now in next:\r\n* `datum_t::size()` is now called `datum_t::arr_size()`\r\n* `datum_t::as_array()` has been removed. If you want to iterate over an array, use the `arr_size()`/`get(size_t)` interface.\r\n* `datum_t::as_object()` has been removed. If you want to iterate over an object, use the new `obj_size()`/`get_pair(size_t)` interface."
