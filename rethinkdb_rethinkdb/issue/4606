We don't have a resolution on that yet, but regardless of how that conversation comes out we should have a test for each driver that attempts to hit the open file limit by looping over:\n- open connection\n- simple query (to make sure it is open)\n- close connection\n\nIf we set a low resource limit on the test, then loop a few thousand times that should be enough to prove that we don't have an issue.\n"
