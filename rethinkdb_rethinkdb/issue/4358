        "In the Python documentation, it says \"Avoid using repl in application code. RethinkDB connection objects are not thread-safe. [...]\". Based on this, it is unclear to me if it is okay to use repl in single-threaded applications/scripts and if there are other differences between using a connection explicitly and .repl.\r\n\r\nP.S.: I hope, this ticket is helpful for you and this is the right place for it."
