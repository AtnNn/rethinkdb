      "If we want to test hombrew installation, then a better option would be to have a complete OS X image (.dmg), and mount it with a shadow file (`hdituil attach <dmg path> -readonly -shadow <file path>`. That way when you unmount it, only the shadow file has to be discarded.\r\n\r\nThe other option is to union mount an empty dmg on top of a volume, but that is only more convenient if you already have an installed physical partition. The dmg version is generally better."
