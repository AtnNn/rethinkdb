      "@coffeemug If you dont mind i would like to push back little on this being back logged. No idea how long it will take for #364 will be ready. Something like this is only a change in the UI to do the math for the user. The other important thing is this really does come down to performance and stability for new users playing around with the database. If they can setup a 4 node cluster click shard 4 ways and start inserting that is HUGE not them having to import data first then shard then start when sharding is done, OR having to learn the admin panel at first.
