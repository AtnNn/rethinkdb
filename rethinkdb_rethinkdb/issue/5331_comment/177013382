      "You could do this by changing the `__repr__` function in python, but that breaks from the python conventions for interactive mode, I think, as a custom `__repr__` is meant to be interpretable.\r\n\r\nIf you do something like\r\n`print r.table('configs').run()`\r\nthen you get the `__str__` method, which is meant to be a user readable version.\r\nAlthough looking into it just now, doing this right now causes an error."
