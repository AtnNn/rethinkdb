        "Another practical limit on the database file size (in reference to #940) is that `conflict_resolving_diskmgr_t` uses `int` to hold values of the form `offset_in_file / DEVICE_BLOCK_SIZE`.  This overflows when the filesize exceeds `512 * 2 GB`, i.e. 1 terabyte, before bugs presumably happen in the `conflict_resolving_diskmgr_t`.\n\nIt's possible that by some freak bit of luck, bugs won't happen until the filesize hits 2 TB.  It's possible that by some freak bit of luck, bugs won't happen even then.\n"
