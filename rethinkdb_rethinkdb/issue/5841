        "I was noticing some weird behavior in the C# driver with the connection pooling code. I noticed, when `Connection.Close()` is called, any attempts to `.Reconnect()`, the reconnect always fails even if the TCP physical socket connection was okay.\r\n\r\nI think this is due some internal `Handshake` state that is not being `.reset()` when the reconnect is attempted.\r\n\r\n##### `Handshake.java`\r\n```\r\n    public Handshake(String username, String password) {\r\n        this.username = username;\r\n        this.password = password;\r\n        this.state = new InitialState(username, password);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void reset() {\r\n        this.state = new InitialState(this.username, this.password);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd there's some code here that kinda [sits here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/java/src/main/java/com/rethinkdb/net/SocketWrapper.java#L82) except, on the 2nd time around, the `Handshake` was finished from the 1st attempt. :8ball:\r\n```\r\nvoid connect(Handshake handshake){\r\n....\r\n            while(!handshake.isFinished()) {\r\n                if (toWrite.isPresent()) {\r\n                    write(toWrite.get());\r\n                }\r\n                String serverMsg = readNullTerminatedString(deadline);\r\n                toWrite = handshake.nextMessage(serverMsg);\r\n            }\r\n....\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo, the reconnect results in no re-authentication...\r\n\r\n`Handshake.reset()` is nowhere to be found in [`Connection.java`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/java/src/main/java/com/rethinkdb/net/Connection.java) or in [`SocketWrapper.java`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/java/src/main/java/com/rethinkdb/net/SocketWrapper.java)\r\n\r\nThe *pythin* :snake: code seems to `Handshake.reset()` in something like [`ConnectionInstance`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/asyncio_net/net_asyncio.py#L154)?\r\n\r\nMy fix in the C# driver is in [`SocketWrapper.cs`](https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver/blob/master/Source/RethinkDb.Driver/Net/SocketWrapper.cs#L42) / [UnitTest](https://github.com/bchavez/RethinkDb.Driver/blob/master/Source/RethinkDb.Driver.Tests/Network/ConnectionTest.cs#L70). ***I think*** this would be the right place for the reset. Also, seems to have resolved my `.Reconnect` issue in the C# driver. :smile_cat: \r\n\r\nLet me knoooooooo what your thinking and I'll submit a PR for ya.\r\n\r\nMuchas gracias,\r\nBrian\r\n\r\n:thought_balloon: :mag: [***\"I want to know... what you're thinking...\"***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijAYN9zVnwg)"
