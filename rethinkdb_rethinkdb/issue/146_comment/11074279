      "RethinkDB listens on 3 ports by default:\r\n8080 - HTTP traffic\r\n28015 - Client drivers (protobuf)\r\n29015 - Intra-cluster traffic\r\n\r\nYou should only see this if something is trying to connect to port 29015 with the wrong identifier at the beginning of the TCP stream.  This can happen if two rethinkdb instances are different versions, but it's equally likely that something else is being directed to the wrong port.\r\n\r\nThe warning you're receiving is really just a warning, shouldn't impact the RethinkDB instance any further, as the connection is immediately dropped before it does anything."
