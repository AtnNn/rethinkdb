      "Hi @charl,\r\n\r\nCould you tell me more about your setup, and what you're doing that causes the warning?\r\n\r\nDoes it happen if you start up just one RethinkDB instance and then query it with the Ruby client?  If so, are you sure that you're pointing the client at the right port?\r\n\r\nAlso, is it possible that you have an older version of RethinkDB running on the same machine that's trying to connect to the newer one when it comes up?"
