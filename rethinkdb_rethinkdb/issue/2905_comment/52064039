      "I spoke to @danielmewes  about it and then took me a while to write this because i got busy. I would recommend that for other reaosns not just this you could\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.server()\r\nr.dc()\r\nr.cluster() \r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will then able able to use changes on top of those. I would also add some of the extra commands for listing servers and listing datacenters just to slowly work on building out some of the api's features. there would not be many things that can be updated from here other then if someone wants to change the name of a server or a dc. yes adding dc's would be nice but that would get a little complicated on doing it right in a short term."
