      "The previous problem was about sequential chained plucks; not a single pluck.  If it had resurfaced it would roughly double the time of the query, not quintuple it (since the problem was that it was evaluating its argument twice).\r\n\r\nThis might be related to the syntax extensions we added.  We should investigate this for either 1.8 or 1.9 when we have time."
