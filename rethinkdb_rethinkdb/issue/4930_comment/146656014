      "@deontologician: what is this about a bridge bot? sameroom.io exists, but I wasn't a huge fan of the experience when testing it.\r\n\r\nI believe Gitter provides a slightly worse experience, and agree with @coffeemug. I'd remove it from the readme, but keep it active for those who prefer it."
