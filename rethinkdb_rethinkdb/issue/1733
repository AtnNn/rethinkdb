        "doing something like:\n\n```\nr.db('test').table('data').getAll('20131130', {index: 'date'}).count()\n```\n\nis very slow for large tables. it would be nice if instead we could do something like:\n\n```\nr.db('test').table('data').count('20131130', {index: 'date'})\n```\n\nand get a count using the index. while i haven't looked at the code, it should be faster to skip getting all docs with a matching index (that is what getAll does right?) and counting the results if you could just look at the index itself and count whats there.\n"
