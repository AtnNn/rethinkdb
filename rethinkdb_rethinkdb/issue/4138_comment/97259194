      "We could do this, but we should think about it first.  We currently use the array/stream distinction to provide information about the performance characteristics of the query.\r\n\r\nIf we do this and a stream doesn't have any duplicates, we'll be using memory proportional to the size of the stream on the server despite the fact that we're returning a lazy stream, and if the user leaves the cursor open that memory will hang around forever.\r\n\r\n(Also, we should make sure to enforce the array size limit if we do this.)\r\n\r\nTagging as a proposal since it would change the type in a way that might be confusing."
