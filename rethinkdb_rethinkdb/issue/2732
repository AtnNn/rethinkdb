        "I know this is a 2.x feature but just wanted to throw it into the system.\n\nThis really only really applies to table backfilling normally when a server restarts and it has to backfil lots of tables or when its checking concitancy on a lot of tables before making them avaiable. I feel like there should be a scoring not sure if its on the level of the table its self global to all servers that have it or if its for each server can have its priority per table but what should get rebuilt first or in what order if 3 tables have score of 100 and then the rest have a score of 1 then the 100 tables run all at once and when all of them are done then the 1 score runs stuff like that.\n"
