      "> Given what's already tracked...\r\n\r\nIsn't that exactly the way of thinking that makes a slope slippery? ;-)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we really need this. Despite being an additional piece of data we track (which I actually think might be ok in this case), it's also work to implement. We need to change the driver protocol, and the server has to track the information and submit it. (#3934 I think will just be another query type similar to noreplyWait, not a deeper protocol change.)\r\n\r\nI'll put it in backlog for now."
