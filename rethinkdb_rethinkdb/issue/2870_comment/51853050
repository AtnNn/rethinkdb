      "It would allow you to write queries like:\r\n```python\r\nr.db(\"rethinkdb\").tables(\"table_config\")\r\n .filter(r.row[\"name\"].match(\"^my_app.photo_\"))\r\n .delete()\r\n```\r\nto delete every table whose name started with `photo_` in the database `my_app`.\r\n\r\nAnother (small) advantage is that it lets users specify a configuration at the same time as they create the table. The normal method of table configuration probably won't let them specify a complete configuration. See #2876 for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage is that it's redundant with `table_create()` and `table_drop()`. Another disadvantage is that insertion doesn't play very nicely with auto-generated UUIDs if UUIDs aren't the primary key."
