      "What do we plan to do with this API?\r\n\r\nIs it purely for an internal use? If yes, it works for me.\r\n\r\nIf not, we should change a few things:\r\n- In case a field is missing, we should provide an error message with all the required fields.\r\n- Requiring the director/replica is not friendly.\r\n\r\nI would basically expect this to work:\r\n```\r\nr.db('rethinkdb').table('table_config').insert({\r\n    db: ...,\r\n    name: ...\r\n})\r\n```\r\nAnd expect the server to come up with a replica/director by himself"
