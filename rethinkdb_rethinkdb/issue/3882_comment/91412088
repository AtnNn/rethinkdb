      "I like the idea of displaying the status of a user-visible shard*server with inconsistent subshard states as `mixed`.\r\nThe readyness values for the whole table should in that case still reflect the actual readyness I think, even if some shards are in the `mixed` state.\r\n\r\nWe could also set the primary and set of voting servers to a special `\"$mixed\"` value whenever they are inconsistent among sub-shards. However that would break the schema, and hence is probably a bad idea.\r\nInstead we could make both the primary server and the voting servers field an array of primary servers / voting server lists. \r\n\r\nIt might look weird to have two or more primaries for a shard. But we can explain that they are in a phase of \"hand over\" and both are serving a separate subset of the shard while doing that. I think that's easy enough to understand."
