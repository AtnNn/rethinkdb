      "boost::scoped_ptr can never be stored in standard data structures.  It's std::unique_ptr that's the problem.\r\n\r\nWe aren't forced to use slower shared pointers.  You can use boost's ptr_containers instead.  std::unique_ptr and standard containers' support for move semantics will make ptr_containers become obsolete."
