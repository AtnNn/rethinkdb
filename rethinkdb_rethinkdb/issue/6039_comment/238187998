      "The rethinkdb driver is there to actually compile your code to a query that will be later executed on the database itself. You can think about ReQL as a language that will compile to something that the database will understand. The compiler have no idea how the branch will resolve later on so it have to compile everything and it hits your undefined variable. That's why you have `ReqlDriverCompileError`.\r\n\r\nI think that's not an issue. It's just that when the driver is so integrated with the language we sometimes tend to forget that it's actually not the same thing that it runs on the database.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."
