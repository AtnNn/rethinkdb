      "Apparently we keep track of elements and functions separately here.\r\n\r\nThe use case for returning `false` here is that we want to let people ask \"does this contain two 2s\" (bag semantics).\r\n\r\nBag semantics for functions make less sense though, because the bag might be satisfied in a different order, which is weird.\r\n\r\nI think we should have bag semantics for elements and set semantics for functions (so that the third one would return true, but the first one would still return false).  If that's too weird, I think we should have set semantics for everything rather than having bag semantics for functions."
