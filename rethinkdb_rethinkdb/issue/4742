        "I'm sure this has been suggested/discussed before but I couldn't find a specific issue for tracking it.\r\n\r\nIn my mind this should be optional to avoid headaches for driver writers. During the initial handshake, the client should tell the server whether it supports compression or not.\r\n\r\nAlso, it may be useful for each response to say whether it's been compressed or not. This helps in HTTP where sometimes you get savings and sometimes the overhead isn't worth it. (e.g. for small responses or responses containing large binaries). This would give us flexibility to tune the precise conditions for compressing responses over time.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n - #1396 is about compressing the data on disk with gzip or the like\r\n - #4397 is about compressing json object representations on disk\r\n - #759 mentions network compression in the title, but it's marked as a duplicate of a disk compression issue"
