        "I inserted a row/object into my local rethinkdb. I am using the `go` driver. \r\nWhen I try to get the thing back using the `id` that I provided, if I use the driver (the go driver) I cannot get it back. \r\nIf I use the Data Explorer web UI, I get one row back, but it is \"null\".\r\nAfter this, any `get` call, with ANY id, even random ids, results a \"1 row returned\".\r\nThis row is null, not that it contains a field that is null. The whole object is null.\r\nI understand that this most likely comes from something that the go driver does incorrectly, but the fact that you can even get into this situation I guess, needs investigation. \r\n"
