      "Thanks for letting us know @Zinssmeister, and sorry you're running into the limit.\r\n\r\nI'm moving this into 1.16-polish since bumping up the limit to say 100 is a very easy change. That being said I cannot guarantee that we will get it into 1.16. We will try to get it in the next release otherwise.\r\n\r\nJust for my own understanding: Is this limit something that affects only the Ruby driver or do we have it in other drivers as well?"
