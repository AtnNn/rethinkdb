      "This is expected behavior.  In debug mode we provide additional information in the error messages to aid with debugging.  In particular, we apped `\"\\nFailed assertion: <info about why the error occured>\"`.  To make the polyglot tests work in Debug mode I think we have to pre-process the error message to remove everything after `\"\\nFailed assertion:\"`."
