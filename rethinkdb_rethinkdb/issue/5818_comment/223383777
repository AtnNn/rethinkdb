      "`brew update rethinkdb` would work fine in this case. `v2.3.2` and `v2.3.3` are fully compatible so there is no upgrade process at all on our side (most of the time that is the case, but we always mention those things in our [release notes](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/releases)).\r\n\r\nI am going to close this, as it is not a bug. A better place for questions like this is probably our Slack channel or Google Groups mailing list: http://rethinkdb.com/community/"
