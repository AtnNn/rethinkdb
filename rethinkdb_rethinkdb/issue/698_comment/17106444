      "So, the interface to `optarg` has you specify the default value as the second argument (e.g. `optarg(\"db\", pointer_to_default_database)`).  If we actually used this interface, it would be great (and greppable; you could just grep for `optarg`).  Right now, though, we aren't actually using that interface; we're just passing NULL as the second argument and branching.  For example, we might write:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nbool val = false;\r\nif (val_t *v = optarg(\"val\", NULL)) {\r\n  val = v->as_bool();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen it should be:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nbool val = optarg(\"val\", new_val_bool(false));\r\n```\r\n\r\n@jdoliner -- how would you feel about just switching to using the interface the way it was intended?"
