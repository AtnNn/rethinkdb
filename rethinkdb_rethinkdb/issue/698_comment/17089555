      "No, they shouldn't be.  They shouldn't be magic constants, but there's no reason they should be concentrated into one header file.  config/args.hpp is a bad file and isn't used for new constants that people want for that reason.\r\n\r\nThey should not be macros, either.  They should be global constants, or even named local variables."
