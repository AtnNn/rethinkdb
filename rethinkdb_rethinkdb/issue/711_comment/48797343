      "I thought that I would do just a little more cleanup, and be done with at least the Python part of it, but it is turning into a large project. As a bit of a preview on this here is a estimation of what needs to be done:\r\n\r\n- [x] hard path references in `bench` need to be evaluated. If they need changes this is at least 40 files to touch\r\n- [ ] `drivers/ruby/quickstart.rb` probably needs to make sure that it is `load`ing the driver it thinks it is\r\n- [ ] `scripts/spin_up_cluster` and `scripts/spin_up_cluster_with_name_conflict` should either be removed, or harmonized with the testing infrastructure\r\n- [ ] `test/common/driver.py::find_rethinkdb_executable` should be placed into `test/common/utils.py` and harmonized with the techniques there\r\n- [ ] `test/common/test_report.py` should probably make sure that it is getting the version of the database that is being tested by asking the executable\r\n- [ ] `test/common/unit.py` should use the tools from `test/common/utils.py`\r\n- [ ] `test/rql_test/drivers/driver.rb` and `test/rql_test/drivers/driver.js` need to verify that they are getting the driver they expect (Python version does).\r\n- [ ] Ruby hard coded and/or unchecked loading of drivers: `test/rdb_workloads/lots_of_tables.rb`, `test/rql_test/server_test.rb`, `test/rql_test/connections/http.rb`\r\n- [ ] JavaScript hard coded and/or unchecked loading of drivers: `test/rql_test/connections/connection.js`, `test/rql_test/connections/cursor.js`, `test/rql_test/connections/date.js`, `test/rql_test/connections/feeds.js`, `test/rql_test/connections/http.js`, `test/rql_test/connections/promise.js`\r\n"
