      "FYI: The scripts in `bench` are mostly deprecated. We should delete all of them except for `set-corecount` and `set-scheduler` maybe, which are still useful.\r\n\r\nUnless we are still using the old stress-client for some tests, in which case we would also have to keep `bench/stress-client` (@AtnNn?)."
