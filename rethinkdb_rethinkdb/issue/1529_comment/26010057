      "@jdoliner awesome\8212explicit is better than implicit!\r\n\r\nGiven how quickly you pulled the solution out of your hat, this is probably more of a documentation issue. A cursory search of the API docs, the cookbook, the \"secondary indexes\" doc, and both quickstart guides doesn't cover the {index: foo} syntax, and when it does, it never mentions its generalized applicability to the primary index.\r\n\r\nAll of this seems obvious after understanding it, but it would have probably saved me a trip to the issue tracker to bug you about it.\r\n\r\nThanks for making rethinkdb! Loving it."
