      "Hi,\r\n\r\nYou have to explicitly use the indexes in RethinkDB. So your query would be:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nr.db(\"polyglots\").table(\"users\").orderBy({index: r.desc(\"id\")}).limit(5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe've talked about having it be a bit smarter and pick out names of indexes if you use them but right now we're keeping things explicit. I'm opening #1530 for us to talk about it this as an option. I referenced this issue from it but if you'd like to weigh in further on that one please do."
