      "Could you guys actually make it a more general issue to make sure the cookbooks have parity with the rql_docs? Me and @mlucy put a decent amount of effort in to make sure all of the use cases we could think of are covered in the rql_docs and it seems like a lot of the uses cases have been completely ignored in the cookbooks and people are having trouble finding them."
