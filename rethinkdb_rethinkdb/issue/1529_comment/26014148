      "Using indexes to speed up filters isn't covered. Using indexes for `order_by` isn't covered. Creating `multi_indexes` isn't covered actually index creation isn't covered at all. `join` aren't covered at all which strikes me as odd since they seem more fundamental than pivots.\r\n\r\nI'm just noticing a lot of cases like this one where someone is saying \"I can't find docs for this\" because it's not in the cookbook or the faq but it's in the API page so it seems like some mass migration could be useful."
