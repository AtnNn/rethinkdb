      "I'm a fan of `map_one` -- I think it establishes `map` and `map_one` as pairs for mapping across either multiple or single documents. \r\n\r\nIf the docs for each command reference both `map` and `map_one`, it should be very easy for novice users to pick the right command intuitively (which isn't the case with `do`)."
