      "@deontologician -- that's actually the opposite case: `merge` in its basic form is defined on objects (but not on arrays), so when someone calls it on a sequence (whether that be a stream or an array) we can choose to map the merge over that sequence without introducing an ambiguity.  `do`, however, is defined on both objects *and* arrays in its basic form, so we can't automatically map it without introducing an ambiguity."
