      "Although I like the name `do`, we could consider calling it `bind` or `as`. In other languages, `q.do(lambda x: b)` would otherwise be represented as `x = q; b;`. This might also work in ReQL, but it would duplicate `q`. It's the old lisp trick of using lambda to implement let.\r\n\r\nI personally like `map1` a lot better than `map_one`, just because it is shorter."
