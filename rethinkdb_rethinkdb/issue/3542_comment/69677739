      "I'm a little hesitant about `map1`/`map_one`.  When you start out knowing what it's supposed to do, it seems like an obvious name, but if you start out knowing the name I'm not sure it's obvious what it's supposed to do.  I could imagine a language where `map1` maps over one array and `map2` maps over two arrays, or where `map1` maps one function, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nI'm also a little bit hesitant about aliasing, for all the obvious reasons, but I'd prefer aliasing to replacing `do` wholesale.\r\n\r\nI think we should try to fix this with documentation and error messages.  Improving `map`'s error message and using `do` more frequently in the documentation might be enough.  If we do as much as we can along that axis and people are still confused, I think aliasing would be the logical next step."
