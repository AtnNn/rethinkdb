      "There's currently the simple work-around of unpacking the backup, renaming the folders inside of it, and then using `rethinkdb import` to load it back.\r\n\r\nRenaming databases sounds useful, and the question has come up a couple of times.\r\nI would use slightly different argument names:\r\n* `--db-prefix`\r\n* `--db-suffix`\r\n* `--db-rename <old>:<new>`\r\n\r\nWe can consider adding similar options for renaming tables at some point."
