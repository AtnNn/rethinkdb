      "If you specify a `--db-prefix|suffix` and a  `--db-rename` I think the rename should take precedence and you'd ignore the prefix/suffix but just for that database.\r\n\r\n**[edit]:** having said that, I can imagine cases where renaming and also appending the suffix would be pretty useful. Anyone else have thoughts on that case?"
