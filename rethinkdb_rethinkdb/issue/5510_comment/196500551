      "If you have a cluster of at least two servers, and a single server fails, you should not get any data loss even with soft durability.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that a write will only be acknowledged once it has been applied on a majority of replicas.\r\n\r\nSoft durability changes the meaning of \"has been applied\" in this, but the write still has to go to a majority first before the acknowledgement. Basically the write will still be applied in memory on a majority before it's acked. Only the writing to disk might be delayed.\r\n\r\nThe documentation is a bit misleading in this detail. I'll open a new issue on our docs issue tracker to address that. https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues"
