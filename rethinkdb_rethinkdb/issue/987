        "I tried to build rethinkdb on a clean OS X (with all the dependencies installed). Here's what happened:\r\n\r\n1. First I got the error `Error: Unable to compile sample protobuf file Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64`. I ran `./configure --fetch protobuf`.\r\n2. Then I got the error message `PROTOC[RB] ../../src/rdb_protocol/ql2.proto Unknown flag: --out` because rprotoc apparently broke the CLI compatibility. I just built without the drivers.\r\n\r\nWe need to make the following fixes:\r\n\r\n1. The configure script should check the protobuf version and tell me to use `--fetch protobuf` if I need it\r\n2. It should check the rprotoc version and tell me if the version is wrong (even if we fix the `--out` issue).\r\n\r\nIn general, I think the configure script should hardcode known good version numbers for every dependency.\r\n\r\n"
