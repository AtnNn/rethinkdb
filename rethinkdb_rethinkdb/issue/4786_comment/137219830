Thank you for the PR!\r\n\r\n@deontologician Could you review please?\r\n\r\n@larkost How hard would it be to add connection tests for SSL connections?\r\n\r\nIt also looks like our API documentation at http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/connect/ doesn't reflect the actual arguments. I'll open a separate issue for that."
