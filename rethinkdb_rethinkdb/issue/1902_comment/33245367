      "I've been a fan of this for a while. One simple technique I've seen in notebook-style UIs is collapsing long results by default.\r\n\r\nThere also may be a way to choose to pin the active input (e.g. a split) so you can scroll through long queries and maintain a notebook feel, but still easily type in queries."
