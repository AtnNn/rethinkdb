      "I'm not necessarily opposed to this, but I usually encounter Notebook UIs in cases where there's a lot of intermediate state.  E.g. you want to define a function and then use it in several interactions, or you want to use the output of the last interaction as one of the inputs to the next interaction by referring to it as `^1` or `_` or something.  So they're really great for e.g. a Julia REPL, but I'm not sure they actually add much to the data explorer."
