      "> Did you build from a clean checkout or tarball of 2.2.0?\n\nYes. I extracted the tarball and built immediately. No system upgrade\nrunning.\n\n> A stale `build` or `external` directory might perhaps cause this.\n\n> I'm guessing you may have libicu-dev 5.5 installed.\n\nYes.\n\n> You might be able to work around this bug by uninstalling libicu-dev, running `make clean` and rebuilding rethinkdb.\n\nWill try.\n"
