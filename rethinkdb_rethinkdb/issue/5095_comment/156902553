      "I believe what happened is that RethinkDB is linking to icu52 as it should, but it is mistakenly using include files for icu55.\r\n\r\nDid you build from a clean checkout or tarball of 2.2.0? A stale `build` or `external` directory might perhaps cause this.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing you may have libicu-dev 5.5 installed. You might be able to work around this bug by uninstalling libicu-dev, running `make clean` and rebuilding rethinkdb.\r\n\r\nThis looks related to #4602."
