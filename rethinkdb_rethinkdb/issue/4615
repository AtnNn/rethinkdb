Maybe you want to use the non_atomic flag? in:\nr.db(\"local_ip\").table(\"todos\").update({done: r.db(\"local_ip\").table(\"todos\").filter({done: false}).count()})\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n```\n\nIt could be helpful to add to the error message: \"Maybe you want to use the non_atomic flag **in the update function**\" or something similar to point me to the source of the problem. Seeing this error and not knowing about non atomic I assumed it was a flag I needed to pass to run.\n\nIt could also be helpful to link to the rethinkdb docs for this error message for more explanation.\n"
