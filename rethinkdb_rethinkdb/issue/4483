        "See #4472. Includes updates to all polyglot tests, so testing the updates to Python and Ruby drivers should be easier now.\n\n@mlucy there were no existing tests that returned an `RqlOpIndeterminateError`. I'm not sure if that's an oversight on my part or if there simply aren't any existing cases that cover that.\n\nI was planning on running the Ruby tests to make sure all the changes to the polyglot tests line up, but I'm getting:\n\n```\n$ ./test/rql_test/test-runner -i rb\nUsage: test-runner [options] [patterns]\n\ntest-runner: error: Unable to find a valid interpreter for language: rb\n```\n\nAlso there are a few failing connections tests in the JS driver right now. Two of them are timeouts, and the others are \"could not connect to server\" errors for `r.http`. So there may be a couple tests in there that still need to be updated, but I was unsure of why they were failing to begin with.\n"
