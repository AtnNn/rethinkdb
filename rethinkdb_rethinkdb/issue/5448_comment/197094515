      "Yes we were seeing it on our servers, it was leaking connections until the cluster ran out of open file descriptors and became unresponsive.  We never applied you change so I don't know exactly if it is the same issue, but downgrading to beta-4 fixes it for us.\r\n\r\nOur use case for connections is to wrap them in a connection pool so we can distribute load to all servers in the cluster and handle node outages.  When the pool evicts a connection we shut it down with connection.close() and it's our guess this was never actually closing the connection."
