      "@sceutre \r\n> When the pool evicts a connection we shut it down with connection.close() and it's our guess this was never actually closing the connection.\r\n\r\nThat actually sounds like it might be a different issue. I think when using `close()` to close the connection, it should have closed the socket even before this patch.\r\n\r\nI can't find anything obviously wrong with the `close()` implementation.\r\n\r\n@sceutre Would you be able to share your connection pool code and maybe the relevant parts of your application with us (my email address is daniel@rethinkdb.com )? I'd like to see if we can reproduce this locally, which would make investigating the issue much easier.\r\nWe can sign an NDA if necessary."
