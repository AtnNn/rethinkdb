      "@AtnNn it would generally be helpful if you could write down the reasons for \"I don't believe that this it maintainable, portable and bug-free\" here in the issue.\r\nThe reason this is stalled appears to be one of missing and mis- communication. I remember you mentioned some specific technical concerns to me (something like this breaks if you do ..., I don't remember exactly what it was). It would be good to have them written out.\r\n\r\nOnce you've done that I'll make specific definite decisions in code review 1918 to get this settled."
