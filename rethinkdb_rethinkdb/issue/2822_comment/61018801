      "Also, this was originally for the sake of implementing #2821, but it turned out I didn't need that change to be made, because I could just use the newer driver version.  #2821 is dead right now because people are telling me to work on other stuff.  I also think this deep import voodoo is nuts and not worth the attempt.  Driver communication by a test such as the one done by #2821 should be done in a separate process."
