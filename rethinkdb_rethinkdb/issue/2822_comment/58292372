      "Apart from the general fact that it sucks to discard work, are there any objections to dropping the `sys.modules` change and closing this issue?\r\n\r\nSince it turned out that we don't actually have a need for multiple driver versions in a test at the moment, and since there are doubts regarding the maintainability of this work-around, it seems that it's not worth merging in.\r\n@larkost what do you think about this?"
