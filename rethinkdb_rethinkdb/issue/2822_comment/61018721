      "> Third, it can easily break code that imports the RethinkDB driver.\r\n\r\nIn any way specific? Is this about the `import rethinkdb` replacement or the deletion from `sys.module`? As far as I understand, we would do the latter one only in our test utils, wouldn't we?\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the more complex replacement for `import rethinkdb` in the driver: \r\nIndependent of the question of whether we have to support multiple driver versions, is this required for loading the full Python driver from a given location during testing (say the current repo, rather than a driver that might be installed system-wide)? Or are we already redirecting `import rethinkdb` to the local driver in a different way which works fine unless we want to load multiple different ones?"
