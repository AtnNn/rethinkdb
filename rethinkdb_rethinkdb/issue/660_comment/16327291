      "It seems to me that the stats are basically supposed to act as a \"heartbeat\" basically serving to give you an idea at a glance of how much load tables or the cluster as a whole are under. In that regard I think @coffeemug's proposal does a better job. It would be off putting for the graph to suddenly drop a lot when a filter came along. I think it might cause people to look for something external going wrong with the cluster (such as machines dying etc.) when really what's going on is that we've just started counting differently. That's just a gut feeling though.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm confused about something you guys said:\r\n\r\n> Now we just report the number of reads in the b-tree if I'm not mistaken.\r\n\r\n> I agree that it's a problem that we don't count range queries.\r\n\r\nThose seem at odds unless I'm misreading. Can someone clarify?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIt seems like the stat @neumino is talking about is queries per second. We could definitely have that too (in fact I suspect we already do.) I'm just not sure where we'd have present it in the webui."
