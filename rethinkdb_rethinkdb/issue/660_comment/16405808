      "Considering that most of the operations have different complexities providing a queries/second stat is pretty useless. What I'd be interested to see is: read/sec and writes/sec. Basically these are the 2 metrics that will help me tune the app/improve queries/remodel data access/etc. \r\n\r\nAs a side note, I think writes/sec should also count writes to the secondary indexes.\r\n"
