      "`N` should be the number of documents, *not* the number of disk accesses. Also, I don't think we should count the number of secondary indexes for writes. E.g. a point write query on a document should always be counted at one write, regardless of the number of secondary indexes. Anything else would be really confusing IMO (we might want to add that later, but that's a different stat all together). I think the dashboard should count number of rows written to and read from. This seems like the most intuitive and useful behavior."
