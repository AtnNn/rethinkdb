      "@al3xandru we talk about the graph in the web interface.\r\n\r\n@jdoliner we just report \"point reads\" on the web interface (queries using `.get()`).\r\n`.between()` is just ignored.\r\nOn the other side, r.table(\"foo\").update( {new_key: 1} ) is going to add N writes, N being the number of documents in my table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I would expect on the interface is more queries/sec and writes_queries/sec\r\nAny query executed on the server would report 1 for queries/sec\r\nAny query that write something would report 1 on writes_queries/sec\r\n\r\nSo we have writes_queries/sec <= queries/sec\r\n\r\n"
