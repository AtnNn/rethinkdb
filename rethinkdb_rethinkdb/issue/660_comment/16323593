      "I agree that it's a problem that we don't count range queries. Multiple people ran into this and were confused. However, I disagree with @neumino about what to do here (we just talked in person). He thinks it would be useful to count each range query as *one* query on the graph. I think the graph should count the number of b-tree accesses per second. So something like `filter` would register as one query in his model, and would register the number of rows filter is processing in my model.\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky, @jdoliner, @anybodyelse, what do you think?"
