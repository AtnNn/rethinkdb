This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.\n\nIt's a little weird that this is being loaded via PJSON (can't update.rethinkdb.com support CORS?), but if anything is getting requested from update.rethinkdb.com, it should be via HTTPS. (I just checked, and apparently update.rethinkdb.com doesn't support HTTPS.)\n"
