        "When a node loses its responsibility as a secondary or primary for a shard, it deletes the documents from its local storage (triggered by reactor_be_nothing).\nHowever the actual storage file (as in 'rethinkdb_data/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000') is never deleted.\n\nEven though https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/310 has been implemented, garbage collection is not aggressive enough to actually allow shrinking the file in many cases. As a consequence, huge files keep lying around on the nodes and never get cleaned up.\n\nWe could either explicitly delete the files if the table is empty (if we can do so safely), or look into what stops the file from being shrunk in practice, despite all documents having been deleted.\n"
