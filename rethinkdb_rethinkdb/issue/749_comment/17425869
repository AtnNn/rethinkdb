      "The distinction is sort of blurring.  As I understand it we use \"write\" to mean anything that modifies the contents of a table, and \"meta\" for any meta-operation on databases, tables, or (now) indexes.  We've also called them \"admin\" operations in some places.\r\n\r\nBasically \"write_or_meta\" means \"this term has a side-effect\"."
