        "Hi i just tried running a cluster of 3 instances and set 3 on both sharding settings.\r\n\r\nThen if I stop one of the instances i get and error about that which is understandable, but im not sure how this would be handled if i try to set the sharding settings back to 1 in the admin ui it just says loading and nothing happens.\r\n\r\nSo is the solution always to get that instance up and running again?"
