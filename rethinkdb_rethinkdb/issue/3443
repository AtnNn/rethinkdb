        "I was talking about this with Slava last week, and the current format seems sub-optimal.\r\n\r\nCurrently we use `{old_val: x, new_val: x}` to specify an initial value.  I think we should move to `{new_val: x}` (note that `{old_val: nil, new_val: x}` would still specify a delete).  This makes the logic to keep a running tally of the top n elements of something a lot simpler."
