      "I think the most important thing here is that in RethinkDB the web UI isn't an afterthought -- it's a very significant application in and of itself, and is critical to the project. So it's not something we can rewrite, we're married to the technologies we picked (and since we had a few false starts, I'd say the current stack is actually pretty good)."
