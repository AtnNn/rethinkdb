      "Thank you @Raynos for this feedback : )\r\n\r\nIt's definitively true that more people know how to use JavaScript than Coffee-Script, and there may be a time later when switching back to JavaScript will be good but I think now is not a good time for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- If people wants to hack in RethinkDB, if will be first to add a feature that they need like supporting a new type of object etc. I cannot think of a feature that the web ui miss that people absolutely need to use RethinkDB (but maybe I'm wrong, in which case I would be glad to hear it)\r\n- CoffeeScript has some advantages, the main one being less verbose, so it's faster to iterate with CoffeeScript.\r\n- Switching back to JavaScript would be more work than just replacing the CoffeeScript files with their compiled version since the code is not especially nice to read.\r\n"
