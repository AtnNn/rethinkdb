      "@danielmewes perhaps, but given that `filter` already does truthy checks I think `.filter(r.row('field')) === .filter('field')` is the only logically consistent interpretation.\r\n\r\nI think where we've gotten into trouble (i.e. what causes ambiguity) are the terms where this is not the case. Another example would be `.count('field')` differing from `.filter(r.row('field')).count()`. In all such cases it's difficult to figure out what's going on under the hood.\r\n\r\nSo whenever possible, I think you should be able to assume a string argument will be converted to bracket term."
