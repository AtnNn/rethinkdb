      "@danielmewes the current behavior is arguably more confusing than a truthy check would be. Since it converts to a constant function `.filter('field')` is effectively `.filter(true)` and this is very unintuitive.\r\n\r\nMy main point is that `.filter(r.row('field'))` and `.filter('field')` should produce the same results."
