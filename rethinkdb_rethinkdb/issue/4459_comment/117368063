      "@marshall007 \r\n> the current behavior is arguably more confusing than a truthy check would be. Since it converts to a constant function [...]\r\n\r\nAh, I forgot we were doing that. I absolutely agree that the current version is already bad.\r\nThis adds a third possible interpretation to the mix though, which doesn't make it better. I think we should remove the current implicit conversion to a constant function with `filter`, and don't do any implicit conversion for `filter` at all."
