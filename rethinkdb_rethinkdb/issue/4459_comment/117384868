      "It's not obvious to me that `filter` and `concatMap` should use the same shortcut rule (in general we use different shortcut rules for different commands, @AtnNn enumerates them above).  I think we should discuss which shortcut rule to use for `concatMap` in this issue and which shortcut rule to use for `filter` in #4480 (which @deontologician just opened).\r\n\r\nFor the narrowed scope of `concatMap` I think we should make `foo.concat_map(x)` identical to `foo.concat_map{|row| row[x]}`."
