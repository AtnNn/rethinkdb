      "Looking through the perfmons, a lot of the bad ones are actually in the cache. I will revisit this when the new cache is stable.\r\n\r\nUntil then, I would like to clean up the serializer perfmons a little bit and remove:\r\n\r\n*serializer_data_blocks_written*\r\n    Because: We already have serializer_block_writes. serializer_data_blocks_written is the same except that it also includes blocks rewritten by the garbage collector. For GC activity we have serializer_data_extents_gced.\r\n\r\n*serializer_data_extents_reclaimed*\r\n    Because: It is effectively the same as serializer_data_extents_gced.\r\n\r\nEdit: In code review 1142"
