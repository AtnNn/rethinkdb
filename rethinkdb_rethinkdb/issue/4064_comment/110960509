      "OK, that worked.\r\n\r\nI removed the whole tarfile directory, re-downloaded, and unpacked, and made the patch change suggested after which it made it to the final step of the make (after several hours).  Keep in mind also that I had run this prior to install and I'm not sure now if this will be needed or not:\r\n\r\n````\r\nsudo apt-get install libicu-dev\r\n````\r\n\r\nHere is the full output.\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/grempe/18450eed500025975811\r\n\r\nHowever, this brought me to the next issue.

It seems the install script makes assumptions about the existence of certain directories (which don't exist on a Raspbian system by default).  I'm assuming your installation script doesn't create missing directories on its own (or is this an artifact of running this make install through 'checkinstall' which wraps everything up in a deb package so I can more easily uninstall later?). I had to do:\r\n\r\n````\r\nsudo mkdir /usr/local/share/doc\r\nsudo mkdir /usr/local/var\r\nsudo mkdir /usr/local/var/lib\r\nsudo mkdir /usr/local/var/lib/rethinkdb\r\n````\r\n\r\nAfter this the install succeeded and I was at least able to start rethinkdb in the foreground.\r\n\r\nHopefully these changes will be baked into the project and the Raspbian install instructions so others don't have to discover this thread to make it all work.\r\n\r\nThanks"
