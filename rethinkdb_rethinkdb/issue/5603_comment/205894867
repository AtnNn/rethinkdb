      "Thanks for the bug report @iorlas1 .\r\n\r\nA pull request would be most welcome. We can run the tests on our end. (You might want to take a quick look at our CLA as well: http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/ .)\r\nIn general the Java drive tests require a running RethinkDB server on your local machine. Then you can run them through `gradle test` in the `drivers/java` directory.\r\n\r\nAlso pinging @deontologician ."
