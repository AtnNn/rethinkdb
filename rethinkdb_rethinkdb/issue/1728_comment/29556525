      "This is actually intended. If it didn't return a `table` you wouldn't be\r\nable to chain an indexed `ordery_by` to it which is an important use case.\r\nIt is a bit weird that you can chain an `insert` after it. But it's not\r\nreally dangerous and it would require a new sortable type to disallow it\r\nwhich isn't worth the complexity.\r\nOn Nov 30, 2013 5:42 AM, \"coffeemug\" <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> > r.table('foo').between('a', 'z').typeOf()\"TABLE\"\r\n>\r\n> I believe the type should be SELECTION<STREAM>.
