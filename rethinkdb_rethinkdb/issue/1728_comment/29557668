      "So, upon further reflection, the only thing I see that we can do by returning a table from `between` that we couldn't do otherwise is this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('foo').between('a', 'z').orderBy({index: 'id'}) // ok\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I really don't think we should special case it like this for `between`, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* We already tell people they can only use one index at a time for now everywhere else\r\n* If we want to allow using multiple indexes (or the same index multiple times), there are many, many equally important cases where we'd want to do the same. I don't think it's worth special casing it here in exchange for a sloppier return type."
