      "The fact that `between` returns a table has bugged me a bit ever since we implemented it.  I think long-term we're just going to have to add another type to the type system (`INDEXABLE_STREAM` or `TABLE_SLICE` or something).\r\n\r\nIn the short-term, another option here is to just add an optarg `order` to `between`, which when set to true causes the resulting stream to be ordered by the same index you're `between`ing on."
