The warning `-Wabsolute-value` could be disabled to silence these, or we could explicitly static_cast the parameters in a few places to double.\n\nIt is likely in some places that the S2 developers meant to use `fabsl` or had to use `fabs` for portability reasons (for Windows?  for 2005-era GNU?).\n"
