        "Example:\n\n``` py\nr.expr(None).order_by(r.args(['a','b'])).run()\n```\n\nOn `v2.0.x`, this closes the connection, and the server prints some errors.\n\n```\nlibprotobuf FATAL /usr/local/include/google/protobuf/repeated_field.h:659] CHECK failed: (index) < (size()):\nerror: Unexpected exception in client handler: CHECK failed: (index) < (size()):\n```\n\nOn `next`, the same error occurs, but the connection survives.\n\n``` py\nRqlRuntimeError: CHECK failed: (index) < (size()):  in:\nr.expr(None).order_by(r.args(['a', 'b']))\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n```\n\nThis is caused because `order_by_term_t` breaks some rules by inspecting the original term tree for `r.asc` and `r.desc` instead of those terms being communicated through the arguments themselves.  I think this would be best solved by extending `val_t` to include wrappers like `r.asc` and `r.desc`.\n"
