        "The init script is 200 lines of complicated shell script. It has a parser for config files and it tries to manage having multiple rethinkdb instances. It has a `start` command which is like `rethinkdb serve`, but with a different behaviour. It also has `status`, `restart` and `stop` commands that rethinkdb does not have.\r\n\r\nThe init script uses different defaults. Config files that work with the init script do not work with plain rethinkdb and vice-versa.\r\n\r\nBecause the init script does so much, it is hard to port to other platforms. A few users have written systemd, upstart and OS X startup scripts for rethinkdb, which all behave very differently.\r\n\r\nBecause of its complexity, it is a source of many bugs and confused users, such as #1078, #1069, #1126, #722, #1115, #1128, #791, #36, #916, #423, #250 and #199.\r\n\r\nIt might be desirable to to move a lot of the complexity of the init script into rethinkdb itself. The goal would be to make it easy to have a uniform behaviour of init scripts on all platforms and to not have different behaviour and default values between the init script and rethinkdb itself.\r\n\r\nHere are some ideas:\r\n\r\n* Add a `status` command to rethinkdb that checks if the server process is still alive.\r\n* Add a `stop` command that kills the rethinkdb process and waits for it to die.\r\n* Add a `restart` command that is equivalent to `stop` + `serve`.\r\n* Add an `--instance <name>` option, that would tell rethinkdb to look in `/etc/rethinkdb/instances.d/<name>.conf`\r\n* For rethinkdb serve and create, `--instance` would be similar to the `--config-file` option, but it would use the defaults that the init script uses (for example, the data directory would be in /var/share/rethinkdb/ and rethinkdb would try to setuid).\r\n* For rethinkdb admin, import and proxy, the `--instance` option would override the `--join` option with the cluster port defined in the config file."
