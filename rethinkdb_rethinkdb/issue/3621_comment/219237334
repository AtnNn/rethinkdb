      "This is sort of a chicken an egg problem. If there is some piece of code that tries to call some of the logging macros  like logERR or logWRN before the fallback writer is installed/initialized then it doesn't yet know what the name of the log file is going to be. I reproduced this exact problem by calling a logERR before https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/administration/main/command_line.cc#L397\r\never gets called.\r\n\r\nI think the following method: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/administration/logs/log_writer.cc#L495\r\n\r\nshould not be allowed to call fallback_log_writer_t::write if the fallback writer hasn't yet being installed and instead should display some sort of message like the following:\r\n\r\n```logging module not yet initialized```\r\n\r\nthat way we can get rid off of  the code that produces the error in \r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/administration/logs/log_writer.cc#L458\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. I can submit this as a pull request"
