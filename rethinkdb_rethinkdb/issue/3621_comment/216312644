      "It looks like there are two different places from where this error would be reported. The first one which you found @javierso (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/administration/logs/log_writer.cc#L340) does indeed contain the error reason.\r\n\r\nHowever there is a second place here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/administration/logs/log_writer.cc#L458 where we don't add any details about why the file couldn't be opened.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked, but it might be that we will always first hit the first error before we can hit the second one, in which case the current situation would be fine (since the reason would get printed with the first message)."
