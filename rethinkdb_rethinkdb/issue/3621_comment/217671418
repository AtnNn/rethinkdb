      "Your first reference , where the error does get displayed properly gets called from here:\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/administration/main/command_line.cc#L397\r\n\r\nLooking around in the code i do not think it is possible for the server initialization to go any further if the function highlighted  above throws. The only way I was able to reproduce a similar behavior as explained #3614 was to comment out the lines in:\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/administration/logs/log_writer.cc#L340.\r\n\r\nWhat version of rethinkdb was this error reported on?\r\n\r\n"
