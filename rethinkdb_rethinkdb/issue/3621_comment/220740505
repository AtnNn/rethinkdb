      "@javierso Nice investigation. Your proposed solution sounds reasonable. The only thing is that the write method should still write the error to standard error if the fallback log writer hasn't been installed yet. (and then follow up with a message such as `The previous message was not written to the log file because the logging module is not yet initialized.`)"
