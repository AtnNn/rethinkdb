      "Are the periods and/or filter conditions for which you need reporting shifting a lot?\r\n\r\nIt might be annoying to implement, but you could maybe maintain separate \"period count\" documents with the current counts for each relevant period. When inserting a new entry you would have to increment the corresponding count documents manually (and decrement them on deletion).\r\n\r\nSorry I don't have a more convenient solution for you right now.\r\n\r\nDo the counts have to be exact or could you work with counts that are somewhat approximate?"
