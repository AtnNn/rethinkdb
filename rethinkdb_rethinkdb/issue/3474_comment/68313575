      "Hello @danielmewes, I am not intending to count the whole lot of millions of rows all the time, there are going to be filters on what to count on. Basically the database is a repository of Call detail records (CDR) which will come in like 3000 to 5000 inserts per second. I need to perform some sort of reporting like how many calls were made during a certain period and that would involve some counts.\r\n\r\nWhat would you advise on how to handle with this situation? Even with the filter, I will have something around a million records to count on. Any hack/fix would remedy the situation?\r\n\r\nThanks."
