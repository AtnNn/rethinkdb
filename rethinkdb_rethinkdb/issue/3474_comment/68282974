      "Hi @nbhatti ,\r\nRethinkDB doesn't currently use indexes for `count`.\r\nThis is a consequence of how RethinkDB organizes its data. Specifically the fact that it uses an append-only storage format makes it more difficult to have document counts in the index.\r\n\r\nWe have been thinking about ways to implement constant-time `count()` on a whole table despite that difficulty (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/152 ), though some of the solutions to that problem won't work for optimizing count on an index range like in your case.\r\n\r\nThe especially slow performance the first time you run the query is likely because of disk access, as you said."
