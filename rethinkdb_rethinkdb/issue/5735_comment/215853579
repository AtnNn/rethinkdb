      "@bearxu83 Thanks for the report. To make it easier for us to reproduce and test this, would you mind providing a few additional details?\r\n* What is the hardware on the Windows and Linux servers?\r\n* What is the network connection between the Windows proxy and the Linux server?\r\n* How does your data look? Can you share a typical example document from each involved table?\r\n* What is the exact query you're running?"
