      "Yeah it's probably not the caching. Just wanted to make sure you ran the query more than once against each server. Thanks for the details on the setup and query.\r\nHow fast is the network connection between your local (?) Windows machine and the Linux servers in the university network?\r\n\r\nCan you check how much CPU the RethinkDB proxy on Windows is using while the query is running (e.g. using the task manager)?\r\n\r\nIt might either be an inefficiency in our Windows port, or the query could be slower because a lot of intermediate results need to be transferred over the network to the proxy.\r\n\r\nIf you have time to try it, it would also be interesting to see what performance you get when running the Linux version of RethinkDB as a proxy in a virtual machine on your local computer (e.g. with VirtualBox or through Vagrant). If the Linux version turns out to be faster, that would strongly indicate that the inefficiency is actually in our Windows port."
