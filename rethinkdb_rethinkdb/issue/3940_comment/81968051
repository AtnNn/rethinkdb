      "There are two separate things here: one is the original behavior where the initial values are split in half.  That should never happen unless the batchspec requires it to, so I'd consider that a bug.\r\n\r\nThe second thing is the fact that we don't send back initial values until the `squash` timer triggers.  That's less a bug than an arguably-bad decision, so I opened a separate issue for it."
