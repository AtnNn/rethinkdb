      "I agree this is a bug. I think your proposed solution would work. Another option would be to reset the metainfo in the same transaction as we delete the data; this is what we were doing before 8d9aaa939db1cf8a7e07e15e910ee8e4405a6e46. Your proposal is easier to implement for now, but the other option might be better because we want to get rid of version ranges in the long term."
