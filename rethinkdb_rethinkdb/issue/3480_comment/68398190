      "The problem with doing large writes in a single transaction is that our cache doesn't handle them well (it consumes loads of memory if the write gets large enough). This was the original reason for splitting the reset data transaction up.\r\nFor getting rid of version ranges, we could move the splitting logic up to have small but atomic erase_ranges over small sub-key-ranges, for which we would update the version individually (as in move the key boundaries)."
