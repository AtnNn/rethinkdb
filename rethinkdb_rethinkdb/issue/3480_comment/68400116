      "> For getting rid of version ranges, we could move the splitting logic up to have small but atomic erase_ranges over small sub-key-ranges, for which we would update the version individually (as in move the key boundaries).\r\n\r\nOh, that's the same as what I was proposing except that I would move the metainfo updating down into `reset_data()` instead of moving the splitting logic up out of `reset_data()`."
