      "Generally if you add terms after the `changes()` command, they will be applied to the change events themselves, and not the documents in the table. So if you add `changes().slice(5, 10)`, that means that the first five changes will be ignored, then the next 5 changes will go through, and then the feed is done.\r\nThis does not correspond to any specific documents. Those changes can come from any documents. For example you might see the insertion of document A and the deletion of document B, but not vice versa.\r\n\r\nIf you want the 5-10th place in the orderBy, your alternative with `skip` isn't going to work properly either. If after the initial results for example the top document changes, you will still get a change notification for that.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB doesn't currently have a way of getting changes on a certain subrange of the ordered documents as far as I know. I recommend getting all 10 top results and then filtering out the top 5 of those in your own code on the client."
