      "> RethinkDB doesn't currently have a way of getting changes on a certain subrange of the ordered documents as far as I know. I recommend getting all 10 top results and then filtering out the top 5 of those in your own code on the client.\r\n\r\nThis would be useful though. Use case: ordered paginated list which is navigated by pagination controls (next, previous, page X, etc). Top 1000 results and then chopping of the first 900 is not really performant ;) Would it be hard to implement skip on a ordered stream or is it already possible? "
