      "I have done some tests about removing replicas in the meantime.\r\nA significant problem leading to excessive memory usage on large tables in that scenario has been fixed for 1.13 as part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2329#issuecomment-42086988 .\r\n\r\nThis should work much better with 1.13.\r\nDropping a replica causes some CPU usage and i/o while the data is being deleted in the background. Memory usage is stable though."
