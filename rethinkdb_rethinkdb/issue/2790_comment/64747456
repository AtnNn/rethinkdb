      "Hi, \r\n\r\nI'm working on a npm package that creates a disposable database for use during testing, and I am currently running into this issue, except instead of just the message, it seems like rethink stops trying to print messages since it can't flush..  I haven't looked at the logging code, but does that sound right? \r\n\r\nIf so, is there any way that the functionality will change? Right now I'm getting around it by looking for an earlier message (instead of \"Server ready\") -- but it would be great if I didn't have to do that... \r\n\r\nThe package is based on this gist (which no longer works, unfortunately):\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/t3hmrman/5dcc25a1cf2c199c8d0d\r\n\r\nAgain, this is not super important (since I have work arounds), and I COULD just do a fire-and-forget kind of method instead of what I'm doing right now, but just wanted to say something in case this gets pushed again\r\n"
