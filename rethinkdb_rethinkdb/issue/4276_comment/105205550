      "It looks like they're adding `process.env.NODE_UNIQUE_ID` to their generated IDs, so as long as that's different on all your nodes you should be fine.  We offer our own UUID generator `r.uuid()` as well if you'd prefer to use that: http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/uuid/ .\r\n\r\nClosing this issue, but feel free to ask more questions here."
