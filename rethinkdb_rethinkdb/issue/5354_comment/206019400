      "The `connections/asyncio_connection_3_5.py3.5` setup was pretty broken:\r\n1. It assumed that `test/rql_test/connections/asyncio_connection_3_5.py3_5.test` would be run with Python 3.5. Rather it is just run as an executable and the shebang line made that the system default Python (for most systems: 2.7).\r\n2. That same file then checked if it was running Python 3.5 or greater, then used `sys.exit(0)`. This signals the test system that it passed.\r\n3. In the case of the wrong version of Python an `AssertionError` would have been thrown, and not caught by the `try` block that was set out for it since that latter was looking for an `ImportError`.\r\n4. The line that ran the actual test file then chose `python3` rather than `python3.5` as the default.\r\n\r\nWith 6651ae74 I have moved the version check into the actual test,and fixed it to run on Python 3.5. I also did some other generic cleanup on stuff that I noticed (e.g.: unneeded imports). The test is, of course, still failing."
