      "@Tryneus I'm (re)assigning this to you. \r\n\r\nReminder that the `./test-runner` says that the asyncio tests are passing just fine but running the test file directly them with your local `python3.5` install has most of the tests fail with recursion depth exceptions as well as other fails.\r\n\r\n* I added a couple instances of `async for ... in ....`, updating from the `cursor.fetch_next()` pattern.\r\n* I went and added an awaitable `_stop` in `net_asyncio.py` that I think is also necessary. \r\n* An assert for > Python 3.5 version in the `.test` file\r\n\r\nAlso CC: @larkost to check this out.
