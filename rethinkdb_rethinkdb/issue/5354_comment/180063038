      "I added a test file with the suffix `_3_5.py3.5` to differentiate from the original `asyncio_connection.py` since these are the tests using syntax found only in Python 3.5. \r\n\r\nAll `@asyncio.routine` decorators have been replaced with `async def ....` and removing some deprecated `asyncio` methods in 3.5. \r\n\r\nThere's a lot of places where the tests use `cursor.next` where we could now use `async for ... in ...` to iterate automagically over an awaitable iterable but I wasn't super acquainted with the tests so I left it at this.
