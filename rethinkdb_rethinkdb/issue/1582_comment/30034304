      "I'm ok with this, but I do have a few more thoughts:\r\n\r\n> @coffeemug -- `and_` and `or_` seems to be the choice that other people have made (e.g. http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/core/tutorial.html ).\r\n\r\nI'm usually in favor of at least checking what others do and taking inspiration from it if it's a good idea, but I wouldn't take style advice from SQL Alchemy (not because they're bad, but because I find myself very often disagreeing with their style decisions).\r\n\r\nAlso, note that while `r.all` and `r.any` are weird in infix mode, IMO they make a lot of sense and read well in prefix mode.\r\n"
