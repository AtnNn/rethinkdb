      "I am satisfied.  I think the only thing left to discuss is what to document.  I think we should document `r.and / &` for Ruby, `r.and_ / &` for Python, and `r.and` for JS.  (Note that `r.all` and `r.any` are currently undocumented, so this would only involve adding documentation to Ruby and Python to mention the non-infix version of the commands.)"
