      "Taking a look at this now, and I've noticed the following additional issues:\r\n\r\n* `r.any` and `r.all` are not documented anywhere in our API page for any language\r\n* `r.any` and `r.all` are not implemented in javascript (is there a reason for this?)\r\n* compose() is incorrect on `r.any` and `r.all` (and thus `&` and `|`) in python - it will only show the first two arguments\r\n* the error message in the original post should probably suggest using `r.any` or `r.all`\r\n* while python does not implement `r.and` or `r.or`, it does implement `r.not_`, so perhaps `r.and_` and `r.or_` should be added for consistency\r\n\r\nSince these are all tangentially related, I'll be fixing or tracking the progress of all of these in this issue."
