      "> `r.any` and `r.all` are not implemented in javascript (is there a reason for this?)\r\n\r\nIn Javascript we can use `and` and `or` since they aren't keywords (and there are no overloadable operators). So we just settled on those and never implemented `any` and `all`. I think we should implement them for consistency.\r\n\r\nI agree with all your other points, FYI.\r\n\r\n> Actually, we should arguably kill `any`/`all` entirely and only support `and`/`or` in all three drivers (or at least only document them).\r\n\r\nI'm opposed to that. I prefer `any`/`all` to `or_`/`and_`. I think the latter is ugly and I wouldn't want to use it in my code/demos."
