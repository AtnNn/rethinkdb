      "This is up in review 1075.  A few notes about what happened:\r\n\r\n* Nothing has been done regarding `r.any` or `r.all`.  As I understand it, we may want to deprecate these to have a more-consistent API, but there's no rush to do this.\r\n* Fixed `compose` on binary operators and such in the python driver, there were multiple issues.\r\n* Added the error message from the original issue for calling a comparison operator on the result of an infix binary boolean operator\r\n* Added `r.or_` and `r.and_` to the python driver\r\n\r\nThe docs still need updating for this, but does this satisfy everyone?"
