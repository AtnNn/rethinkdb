      "I have a suspicion that we're hitting a kernel limit on the number of non-contiguous virtual memory regions due to our use of `mprotect` in the coroutine stacks. This is still very speculative though and I haven't fully verified this yet.\r\n\r\nWe can probably reduce the number of coroutines we allocate for the workload the table_fuzzer is generating.\r\nHowever it's important for other workloads as well that we can handle large numbers of coroutines (e.g. users having a lot of changefeeds open at the same time). The limit can be increased on Linux by setting `/proc/sys/vm/max_map_count`, but it would be nice if we wouldn't require this."
