      "Actually it seems that the unexpected backtrace is just a side effect of backtraces not working.\r\n\r\n@atnnn commented out that assertion, which lead to the message \"Could not retrieve pthread stack field locations.\" being printed over and over.\r\n\r\nThat message is part of OS X specific backtrace code in rethinkdb_backtrace.cc\r\nMaybe @srh knows something about that code?"
