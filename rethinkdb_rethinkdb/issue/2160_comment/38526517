      "> @atnnn commented out that assertion, which lead to the message \"Could not retrieve pthread stack field locations.\" being printed over and over.\r\n\r\nThat means pthread_t is defined in such a way that the stackaddr and stacksize fields are not accessible in the pointee.  We scan through the struct pointed at by the pthread_t so that we can temporarily change the fields to the current coroutine stack bounds before calling backtrace().  There is nothing we can do (without getting even _more_ unreasonable) if the system doesn't have pthread_t point to such a struct."
