      "@coffeemug There's no need to release anything here. This issue didn't exist in 1.13.1. We just have to get the fix in before tagging 1.13.2.\r\n\r\n@MichaelValentine You can check out daniel_2640 for a variant of v1.13.x (as of this morning) with the fix applied. I expect that we can merge the fix into v1.13.x and next tomorrow.\r\n"
