        "I often find myself defining intermediate functions in my code so that I don't wind up building monolithic queries on a single line. I might for example do something like this:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ndef score(game):\r\n    return (game[\"points\"] - game[\"deductions\"]) * game[\"mulitplier\"]\r\n\r\ndef games(player):\r\n    return r.table(\"games\").get_all(player[\"id\"], index=\"player_id\")\r\n            .filter({\"game_state\" : \"valid\"})\r\n\r\ndef scores():\r\n    return r.table(\"players\")\r\n            .map(lambda p: games(p)\r\n                           .map(lambda x: score(x))\r\n                           .reduce(lambda x,y: x + y))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving to call the functions prefix is a little bit unreqly and I think it would be cool if there was a decorator that made functions in to methods. For example you might write:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n@doc_method\r\ndef score(game):\r\n    return (game[\"points\"] - game[\"deductions\"]) * game[\"mulitplier\"]\r\n\r\n@doc_method\r\ndef games(player):\r\n    return r.table(\"games\").get_all(player[\"id\"], index=\"player_id\")\r\n            .filter({\"game_state\" : \"valid\"})\r\n\r\ndef scores():\r\n    return r.table(\"players\")\r\n            .map(lambda p: p.games()\r\n                           .map(lambda x: x.score())\r\n                           .reduce(lambda x,y: x + y))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems like this could be nice."
