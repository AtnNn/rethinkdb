      "yeah on a fresh checkout for me (like absolutely fresh, new folder, new fork from github etc), I get this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmbroadst@retinoid:rethinkdb-mbroadst (next=)$ git status\r\nOn branch next\r\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/next'.\r\nChanges not staged for commit:\r\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\r\n  (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\r\n\r\n\tmodified:   admin/static/js/date-en-US.js\r\n\tmodified:   test/performance/comparisons/jquery.tablesorter.js\r\n\tmodified:   test/rql_test/connections/http_support/jinja2/LICENSE.txt\r\n\tmodified:   test/rql_test/connections/http_support/werkzeug/LICENSE.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty annoying. I was fetching changes from upstream on my local fork to submit a patch, and now I have to run through a number of other hoops"
