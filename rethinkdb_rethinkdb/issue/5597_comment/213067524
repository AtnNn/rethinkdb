      "@mbroadst Those are the files I committed. Can you try clearing out `.gitattributes` and then pulling again (and then checking out `.gitattributes` again)?\r\n\r\nAlternatively I was able to resolve this in one case by deleting those files locally through `rm` (not `git rm`), and then checking them out again."
