        "Had a point where i had 2 machines master pinned to one dc but the master dc did not have the data yet. Network failure in the end machines disconted and sincei did not need the new node anyway i did not have them reconnect. Ended up in a state were both nodes did not wanna relize they had the table data. I have the table file from 1  node if anyone wants it. 1 server i was able to get it to say it sees the 90docs in the table but no querying the other one did not wanna allow anything. had to reconnect them and remove master pinning for it to fix it self.\n"
