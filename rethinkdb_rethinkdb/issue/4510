I don't use the WebUI very much, but every time I do I find myself trying to click on these before remembering I have to click on the less-visible navigation bar above.\r\n\r\nEither we should make all of these clickable (no idea where \"Connected to\" would go) or even better somehow combine the two bars into one."
