      "@danielmewes Thanks for the thoughts put into this. \r\n\r\nUsing a table might work with timestamps as key, might give that a go. \r\n\r\nYeah, squashing changes would indeed make the replay unusable to function as an eventstore: I'd need every event to be replayed, not just the endresult; that's the premise of using an eventstore in the first place. \r\n\r\nThanks for clarifying!"
