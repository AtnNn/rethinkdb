      "hmm I just found out that change feeds do not guarantee delivery : \"Since changefeeds are unidirectional with no acknowledgement returned from clients, they cannot guarantee delivery. If you need real-time updating with delivery guarantees, consider using a model that distributes to the clients through a message broker such as RabbitMQ.\"\r\n\r\nSo the event sourcing use case is not a good fit for rethinkdb :cry:.
