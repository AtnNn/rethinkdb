      "@gebrits Yes that's true. Once we have the full version of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3471, \"at least once\" delivery is going to be possible (with the limitation that multiple changes on the same document might get merged into a single event).\r\n\r\nNote that the solution that we currently settled on in #3471 is not sufficient for this though, since it doesn't work if a server goes down or a table is reconfigured. We're planning a more sophisticated solution for later, but there's no ETA on that yet."
