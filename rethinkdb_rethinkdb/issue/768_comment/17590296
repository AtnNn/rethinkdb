      "I'm not so sure this is a good idea.  I can't think of anything else off the top of my head that supports multiple protocols (one of which is HTTP!) on the same port.  Hell, even web servers use different ports for HTTP and HTTPS.\r\n\r\nI'm generally of the opinion that you should try to do the least surprising thing unless it's a major pain-point, and I don't think I've heard anyone complain about having to use different ports for HTTP connections and driver connections."
