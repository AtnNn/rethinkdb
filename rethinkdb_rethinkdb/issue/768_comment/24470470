      "@mlucy\r\n> I'm not so sure this is a good idea. I can't think of anything else off the top of my head that supports multiple protocols (one of which is HTTP!) on the same port\r\n\r\nZNC is a good example of a single port system. It uses the same port for connecting your IRC client, and it's also the same port for connecting to the web interface. Although, that's one of the very few things that I know uses a single port for multiple functions."
