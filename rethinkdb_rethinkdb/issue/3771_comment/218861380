      "If this was done, I think it'd also be important to start having rethinkdbdash start following semantic versioning. Currently npm defaults to `^` for versions, which leaves almost everyone using rethinkdbdash vulnerable to random breakage.\r\n\r\nMost people who use rethinkdbdash have gotten used to this, but if the official driver suddenly moved to being non-semver during the transition that would likely cause a lot of confusion."
