      "It's super silly and confusing to end users (like me :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) to have two competing mostly official node.js rethinkdb drivers. (since @neumino ~~is~~ was a RethinkDB employee, I consider rethinkdbdash \"mostly official\"-- it's very different than someone random publishing another node driver.)\r\n\r\nIt's not like rethinkdbdash is just some sugar on top of the official driver, either -- it's a complete rewrite as far as I can tell, in a different language no less, which is kind of frightening."
