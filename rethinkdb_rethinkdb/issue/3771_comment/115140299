      "Oh, I guess the `r(connection_opts)` syntax would conflict with the current handling of `r` as a synonym for `r.expr`, huh? That's a bummer. Maybe it could be deprecated, the context-instantiating version of `r` given a name like `r.connection` or `r.context`, and `r` itself changed to a synonym of `r.context` in the next major release (which could maybe *be* the jump to `rethinkdbdash`, since trying to keep driver versions in lock with the server version is kind of futile)?"
