      "It would probably be better if we could avoid porting `rethinkdbdash` to the browser. I'd imagine it would be much simpler if the browser sent the plain-text query to a separate (Node?) process which would evaluate the query and send the results back as JSON.\r\n\r\nSomething like that would allow all the HTTP stuff to be dropped from `rethinkdb` core and open up the possibility of supporting other languages in the Data Explorer in the future.\r\n\r\nI'll probably take a stab at this and see how it goes if that seems reasonable to you guys."
