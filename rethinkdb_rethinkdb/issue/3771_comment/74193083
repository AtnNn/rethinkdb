      "I think forking rethinkdb-dash seems like a bad idea. One of the reasons it is good is because @neumino maintains it and knows the ecosystem well and doesn't hesitate to break compatibility with the other drivers.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is that it would need to be adapted to run in the data explorer."
