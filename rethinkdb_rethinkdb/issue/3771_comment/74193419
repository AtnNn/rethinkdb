      "@marshall007 as far as I understand implementing the `Stream` interface on the cursor directly would be risky because of the special meaning of `null` in Streams (as discussed in #3600).\r\n\r\n@AtnNn It would definitely be nice if we could avoid forking, but since we want to do some things differently there might be no way around it.\r\nWe could consider just maintaining a patch file and applying it to upstream rethinkdbdash. That way we would be less likely to diverge too far.\r\nAlso good point about the Data Explorer, I forgot that in my list."
