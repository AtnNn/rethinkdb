      "> I thought that the error about array could be triggered with group/ungroup only if\r\n- a group has more than 100k elements\r\n- there are more than 100k groups\r\n\r\nNo, we changed that. If we did it this way, in a pathological case you could have 100k*100k elements, which would blow the memory. Right now G*E has to be < 100k, which makes memory consumption guarantees more robust."
