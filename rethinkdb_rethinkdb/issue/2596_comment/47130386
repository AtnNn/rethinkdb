      "Hey Mike,\r\n\r\nYes, you have it correct...I was under the impression that the number of\r\ndistinct groups was bounded by 100K and the resulting grouped data was\r\nbounded by 100k as well, but that the total docs to be grouped was not\r\nbounded by 100K...after reading your response, I realize that my assumption\r\nwas incorrect.\r\n\r\nI think having the 100K bound be configurable is a good move -- that way,\r\nthose who have the memory to spare can use it.\r\n\r\nBrandon\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Jun 24, 2014 at 9:28 PM, Michael Lucy <notifications@github.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Hi,\r\n>\r\n> Thanks for the bug report. I'm having some trouble understanding the false\r\n> error here. Just to be clear:\r\n>\r\n>    - r.table(myTable).group(field).ungroup().run() produces an error.\r\n>    - r.table(myTable).group(field).map(lambda x: [x]).reduce(lambda x,y:\r\n>    x + y).ungroup().run() does not.\r\n>    - There are about 25k groups with 31 docs each.\r\n>\r\n> Is that right?\r\n>\r\n> If so, that seems like expected behavior. 25k * 31 > 100k, which is the\r\n> size limit, and adding a reduce on the end like the error message\r\n> suggests seems not to produce the error.\r\n>\r\n> In a future version (hopefully 1.14), the size limit of 100k will be\r\n> configurable.\r\n>\r\n> \8212\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\r\n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2596#issuecomment-47050952>\r\n> .\r\n>"
