      "I did some digging in the Python driver after creating this issue and the actual culprit is the `ISO8601()` function. Python datetime is converted by passing the output of `.isoformat()` into `ISO8601()` and that's where the truncation happens.\r\nHere's an example show the issue without the Python driver:\r\n`r.expr(r.ISO8601('2016-01-01T00:00:00.000999+00'))`\r\n`ISO8601()` should be fixed, but it would likely be more efficient to have the Python driver call `r.time()` so that the conversion to/from a string representation doesn't need to happen."
