      "Interesting.\r\n\r\nI think the core issue is not so much that RethinkDB rounds times, and Python doesn't, but that RethinkDB doesn't *always* round the times when they are inserted\r\n\r\nAs you demonstrate, our conversion routine from Python datetime appears to just cut off anything below milliseconds, rather than rounding it properly.\r\n\r\nI think we should consider this as a bug in the Python driver."
