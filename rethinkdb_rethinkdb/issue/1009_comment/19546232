      "Ah, basically we're using mongo + elasticsearch right now, which I think is a pretty common configuration for many. (Basically majority of reads, i.e. searches goes through elasticsearch. Mongo is great as the persistent layer.) We can't move off of it or even consider trying rethinkdb until it supports elasticsearch also. "
