      "All right, I did a bit of research, and here's what I found out.\r\n\r\n1. To be able to implement \8221pull\8221 approach for indexing content with ElasticSearch source must provide some sort of monitoring. Like CouchDB _changes or operation log in MongoDB.\r\n2. RethinkDB does not have monitoring yet. I think there are some big plans about embedding Node.js and adding triggers (#997), but it'll happen who-knows-when.\r\n\r\nWhat that means is for now it's better to stick with \8220push\8221 approach where you directly tell ElasticSearch what to index. I know it requires your software to do that instead of having river plugin that will transparently pull and index things. But that's better than having river plugin that will fetch data periodically which removes all purpose of having river plugin at all."
