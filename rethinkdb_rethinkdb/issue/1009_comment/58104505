I've created rethinkdb/elasticsearch-river-rethinkdb#2 so we don't forget about this feature.\r\n\r\nClosing out this issue as the river is implemented and has documentation (https://github.com/rethinkdb/elasticsearch-river-rethinkdb). There's an upcoming article that will discuss it a bit more in depth."
