        "We currently have a really sophisticated infrastructure for throttling queries composed of a multi_throttling_server_t on each primary and a set of multi_throttling_client_ts on each node that runs queries.\r\n\r\nThis system causes intra-cluster messaging overhead. It's also complex and difficult to understand and tune.\r\n\r\nWe might not need it at all. Alternatively we could throttle the number of outstanding master requests on the parsing node's side to a fixed number."
