      "That would solve this particular problem, but it's really hard to look at user input and figure out whether it will cause a stack overflow.  I think we should instead detect stack overflows and recover cleanly with an error for the user.  (Also, are coroutine stack sizes configurable?  We might want to add a ReQL optarg to increase them in case people really need to work with deeply nested data, the same way we want to let people increase the array size limit.)"
