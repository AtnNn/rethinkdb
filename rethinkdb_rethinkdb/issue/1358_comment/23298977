      "Most things are okay because it is IO wait. The cpu jitters and load average both go up the cpu time being used in non idle is +95% the entire time. I do have other processes that do take much longer to run now they are usable i can login i can still htop and so on but the load average also does get a lot worse if i do anything else . What will the extra io-threads do.\r\n\r\nThe reason i was recommending using nice would mean otherrethinkdb tasks can run in non nice and be able to run the database almost normally."
