      "This is very likely fixed in next due to #752 being fixed. RethinkDB doesn't use a separate process for indexing and doing so would be basically impossible architecturally at this point. If it's feasible I'd recommend running the version out of next I suspect that this will completely eliminate the problem. If not we could look in to doing a release for it."
