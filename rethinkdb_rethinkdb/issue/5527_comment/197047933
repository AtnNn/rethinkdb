      "In indexes, a more compact representation is already used (though it could be made even smaller).\r\n\r\nI think it's a good idea to reduce the sizes of the internal field names as you suggest, so dates use less space in a table. We should also check if we can save space for geometry data, though I think those are already fairly compact."
