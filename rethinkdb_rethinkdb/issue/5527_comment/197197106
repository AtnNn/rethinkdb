      "We shouldn't change the name to `$r_t$` without thinking about it.  We explicitly reserve the namespace `$reql_*$` for ourselves, which is important because if users have data with keys that match our magic internal names RethinkDB won't safely store and retrieve that data.\r\n\r\nI think we should instead just serialize pseudotypes to disk in a way that ignores their actual object representation."
