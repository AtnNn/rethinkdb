      "I'd be fine with `emergency_repair=None|'unsafe_rollback'|'unsafe_rollback_or_erase'`.\r\n\r\nThe problem with `allow_unsafe` is that it doesn't say what's actually happening. `reconfigure(emergency_repair=\"unsafe_rollback\")` is fundamentally different from `reconfigure(shards=X, replicas=Y)`. That's why I like having the words `emergency_repair` in there; it's effectively the name of a subcommand you're invoking. But `allow_unsafe=\"rollback\"` makes it sound like you're modifying the normal command, which you're not."
