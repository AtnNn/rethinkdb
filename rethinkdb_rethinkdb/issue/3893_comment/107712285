      "I agree in general, but I think `override` isn't a good name because it implies that the user specifies a config that will override what's in the cluster. But we don't let users specify anything, so they're not really \"overriding\", they're \"repairing\", which is why I think `repair` or `emergency_repair` is a slightly better name."
