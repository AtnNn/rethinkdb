      "We should have a way of passing the optarg's default value for consistency with the rest of the query language.  Every other optarg has a default value you can pass.  I'm not too concerned about mixing types here, ReQL is a dynamic language.\r\n\r\n(Also, it seems people are happy with the current solution, but what about `allow_unsafe=False` `allow_unsafe='rollback'` and `allow_unsafe='data_loss'`?  That reads pretty clearly to me.)"
