      "I'd like to support both modes even in the first implementation. There's a huge difference in how dangerous they are.\r\n\r\nI agree with @coffeemug that `override` is not a good name.\r\n\r\nI think it's important to have the word \"unsafe\" or a similar word somewhere in every invocation of the command. A user who has not read the documentation should be able to look at the command and immediately see that it's unsafe. I'm not sure that `table.reconfigure(emergency_repair=\"allow_rollback\")` makes that clear enough."
