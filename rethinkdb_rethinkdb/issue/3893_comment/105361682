      "If we wanted to give the user more control, we could add a `dead_servers=[...]` parameter to `table.reconfigure(emergency_recovery=True)`, to allow the user to specify exactly which servers should be demoted. This would make it easier to explain the behavior to people, perhaps.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is that we might want to introduce a new command like `table.repair()` instead of overloading `table.reconfigure()`."
