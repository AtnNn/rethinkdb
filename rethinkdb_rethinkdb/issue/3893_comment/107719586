      "When I said \"Currently I'm not planning to allow `db.reconfigure(hard_override=True)`\" I meant that the user would have to run the command on each table one at a time, rather than on the entire database at once. The important part is the `db.` versus `table.`.\r\n\r\nI dislike `unsafe_erase` because it will sometimes rollback. `unsafe_rollback_or_erase` is a much more accurate description of what it does.\r\n\r\nI agree that `allow_data_loss` is a bad name because it incorrectly implies that `allow_data_loss=False` will never lose data."
