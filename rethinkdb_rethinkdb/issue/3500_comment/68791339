      "That sounds like a regression. There's a bit of a complex mechanism at work here (it could probably be simpler):\r\n\r\n  - There's a helper for returning the status of a table (`humanize_table_readiness`): https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/admin/static/coffee/util.coffee#L109\r\n  - That helper is used in the Handlebars template, which is re-rendered on a regular basis: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/admin/static/handlebars/tables/table-template.handlebars#L10\r\n  - The LESS file has specific classes for the red and green lights: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/admin/static/less/styles.less#L1370\r\n  - Here's the view generating the template and passing the current status: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/admin/static/coffee/tables/index.coffee#L307"
