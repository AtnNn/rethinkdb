        "Splitting #2663 into multiple issues. This issue covers the low-level cluster config API.\n\nServer status:\n\n``` py\n# Documents in this table are readable but not writeable by the user;\n# table gets updated by the system as servers enter and leave\n# the cluster\n> r.db('rethinkdb').table('server_status').run()\n[{\n  # Field `server` stores the user-defined name of the server, which\n  # is the primary key you can use to .get() the document\n  \"server\": \"server_1\",\n\n  # TODO: once Tim gives me additional information that might go here,\n  # I'll prettify the document and improve its usability\n}]\n```\n\nCluster configuration:\n\n``` py\n# Documents in this table are readable and writeable by the user;\n# documents don't change unless the user writes to them or issues\n# a higher level command explicitly\n> r.db('rethinkdb').table('cluster_config').run()\n[{\n  # primary key, a db_name/table_name pair; named \"table\"\n  \"table\": \"db_name.table_name_1\",\n\n  # list of shards for the table\n  \"shards\": [{\n      # list of replicas; must be the same length across all shards;\n      # servers are specified by name\n      \"replicas\": [\"m1\", \"m2\"],\n\n      # priority list of directors; must be a non-empty subset of replicas;\n      # this field may be omitted, in which case the system just uses the\n      # replica list above\n      \"director_candidates\": [\"m2\"]\n  }]\n}]\n\n# Note, for the initial implementation, if there is a conflict, the server will\n# throw an error if the user tries to read the offending document. In range reads,\n# we'll send an `errors` field like we normally do in range writes.\n```\n\nCluster status:\n\n``` py\n# Documents in this table are readable but not writeable by the user;\n# table gets updated by the system as the cluster status changes\n> r.db('rethinkdb').table('cluster_status').run()\n[{\n  # primary key, a db_name/table_name pair; named \"table\"\n  \"table\": \"db_name.table_name_1\",\n\n  # TODO: once Tim gives me information we might want to include,\n  # I'll prettify the document and improve its usability\n}]\n```\n\nCommands:\n\n``` py\n# Elect a new set of directors for the shards. The command will\n# pick available directors from the `possible_directors` list,\n# and will try to get one as close to the beginning of each list as possible\nr.table('foo').elect_directors()\n```\n\nNote, I've only specified commands that are necessary for the system to operate. We'll specify porcelain commands in a separate proposal for a higher level API.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- ReQL commands, including `changes` and the new `t.get(x).changes()` API should work on the system tables.\n\nOpen questions:\n- Is there a better phrase than `possible_directors`?\n- Is `elect_directors` too high level?  Do we want to allow director election on a per-shard basis?\n- Should `elect_directors` be in a different namespace because it's an admin command? E.g. `r.elect_directors('db.table')` or some such?\n- We don't have a good spec for tables. We can use a tuple (e.g. `['db', 'table']`), a string (e.g. `'db.table'), or an object (e.g.`{db: 'db', table: 'table'}`), but the latter would only work if we had support for primary keys on multiple fields.\n\nAlso:\n- I checked with @mglukhovsky, and he finds everything to be very nice and clear, which is a very good sign.\n\n/cc @timmaxw\n"
