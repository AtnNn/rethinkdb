      "I think we should do what I wrote above for `avg`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, and `count`.\r\n\r\nThere's a small wrinkle, which is that you can pass functions to aggregators as well as field names.  I think in that case we should use an ordinal (the offset of the function) as the name in the resulting object.  So `tbl.group('id').avg(lambda{|row| row['dem']}, lambda {|row| row['gop']})` would return `{1: DEM_AVG, 2: GOP_AVG}`."
