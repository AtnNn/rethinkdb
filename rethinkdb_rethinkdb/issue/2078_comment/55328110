      "I'm not opposed to adding a way to do arbitrary combinations of reductions, but it's a lot more work (and a much more contentious API discussion).  I think that should be a separate issue (e.g. #1725).\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be opposed to ignoring this issue and jus waiting until we have enough time to discuss/implement the more complicated thing."
