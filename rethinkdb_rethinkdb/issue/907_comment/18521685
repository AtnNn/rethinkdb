      "I think we have a very real problem of the admin UI requesting far too much traffic from the server. People are already bumping up against this, and we'll need to fix this really soon. This definitely won't make it into 1.6, but as we're starting to work on performance this is very likely to be fixed in 1.7 (within about a month from now).\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting!"
