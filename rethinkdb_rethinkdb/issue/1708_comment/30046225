      "This is implemented. I also had to add a yield in a critical place during directory updates.\r\nIn code review 1081\r\n\r\nWe might still want to consider introducing the delay before sending out a directory update (speculating that we are going to send out an even newer version very soon anyway). That made things a lot more efficient in general, but is not really part of this issue."
