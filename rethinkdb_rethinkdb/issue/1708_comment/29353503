      "One of the problems appears to be that we are sending out a lot of unnecessary directory updates.\r\nIf I add a short delay (e.g. 100ms) before actually sending an updated version of the directory to the other nodes and then send only the most recent version, that reduces the number of directory messages by a factor of roughly 20.\r\n\r\nThis does solve the timeout issue, but I would like to investiage a bit further to figure out\r\na) why the high amount of directory updates would lead to heartbeat timeouts and\r\nb) where the unnecessary (or rather partial) updates originate from exactly"
