      "The *real* problem here is that the message queue takes too long to be processed. Among others, timers don't get executed, which includes the heartbeat timer.\r\n\r\nI think I can fix this once and forever. Our message_hub already has a notion of processing granularity. However it does not process OS events before the whole queue has been processed. That can be changed though.\r\n\r\nIn a second step, I'm going to adjust coroutine priorities a little, so heartbeat-related things receive preferred treatment."
