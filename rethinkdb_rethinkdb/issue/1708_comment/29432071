      "Also heartbeats are sent out only half as often as they probably should be. This might be by design, I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that sending the heartbeat itself notifies the writes tracker. So on the next call to `heartbeat_manager_t::on_timer()`, the heartbeat manager sees that some write (in this case the heartbeat message) has happened since the last time it checked, and does not initiate another write. Effectively this means that a heartbeat is only sent during every second call to `on_timer()`.\r\nAs a consequence, heartbeats are sent out every 4 seconds instead of every 2 seconds."
