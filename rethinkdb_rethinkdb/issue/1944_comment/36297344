      "Just talked to @danielmewes about an additional issue I wanted to point out here.\r\n\r\nSuppose we have N secondaries total.\r\n\r\nWe should also consider backfilling K secondaries at a time (where K < N). I can imagine the primary getting overloaded if we try to backfill a large number of secondaries at once. Alternatively secondaries can backfill from other secondaries and then switch to backfilling from the primary at the end.\r\n\r\nWe should benchmark backfilling to large number of secondaries to see how it affects the primary and whether this is a real problem."
