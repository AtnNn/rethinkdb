        "Make the ruby driver support per-command durability properly.  It needs a durability flag (as described in #890) to be supported on insert, update, replace, delete, and run.\n\nSomehow you can't simply pass such a flag.  For some reason also, the Ruby driver does optional arguments differently from the other drivers. I have no idea how to fix this.\n"
