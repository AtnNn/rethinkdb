        "When running queries in the Data Explorer the processing time returned is the round trip time. I would argue that it's more useful to present the server processing time as the primary metric, the RTT includes HTTP which isn't something that any of the drivers do.\n\nI can think of a few options here, but I'm sure there are others too:\n1. Show Server time/RTT next to each other\n2. Show Server time or RTT as part of the hover text\n\nI know you can see the Server time in the Query profile, but this isn't the default view and could easily be overlooked. As a nice side effect, this would prevent new users from accidentally thinking RethinkDB has high/fluctuating latencies when they are exploring from the Data Explorer.\n"
