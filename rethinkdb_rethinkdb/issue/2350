        "The following two queries are doing more or less the same thing (`get` vs `get_all`).\n`get` returns `skipped=1` when the target document is non existent, but not `get_all`, which I find a bit surprising (I would expect the same result).\n\n![screenshot84](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/297060/2872213/897902e4-d34e-11e3-9d89-2f7b27630aa6.png)\n\nThe documentation says _skipped: the number of documents that were skipped because the document didn't exist_ so I would think this is a bug.\n\nHowever, I prefer the current behavior since NoBrainer throws an exception when skipped != 0. If there is a fix to be done, I'd rather have the documentation say \"except with get_all\", but for the sake of semantics, I'd be preferable to fix get_all to return the number of skipped updates on docs.\n"
