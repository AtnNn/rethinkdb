      "I hate to necropost, but I was told to suggest my statistics feature here. :smile: \r\nA convenient statistics feature to have would be something like an arithmetic mode.\r\n\r\n`r.expr([1,2,2,2,3,3]).mode()`\r\n\r\n`mode()` would be invoked similar to how `avg()` is currently invoked, and have additional options for dealing with funky, bi-modal datasets. At the moment, If I want to take an arithmetic mode of a dataset, the following query gets the job done:\r\n`r.expr([1,2,2,2,3,3]).group(r.row).count().ungroup().orderBy('reduction').nth(-1)('group')`\r\n\r\nThis is fine at the moment, but as an aggregation call I think `mode()` would be a lot terser.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
