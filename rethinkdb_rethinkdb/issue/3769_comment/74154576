      "Hi @elifarley , thank you for your suggestion.\r\nGenerally I think this would be a useful feature, but probably not at the top of our priority list at the moment.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if there's a single-pass algorithm for computing the variance without knowing the mean ahead of time, and which doesn't require O(n) space?\r\n\r\nThat would make it much easier to fit into our existing query language.\r\nA two-pass algorithm would be more difficult to apply, since data might change underneath."
