      "Hi @ntquyen , it's expected that you don't see these messages because the leader election notifications are printed at the \"info\" logging priority.\r\nWe don't print those messages to the terminal. However they should still show up in the `r.db('rethinkdb').table('logs')` table and should be written to the log file. Is that the case?"
