        "First  of all I have no idea why a virtual method that is generally accessed via a pointer in our codebase would be named `operator()` instead of some sensible name.  It certainly isn't for the sake of working nicely with any generic code.\r\n\r\nThe function itself also does this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   virtual done_traversing_t operator()(env_t *env,\r\n                                         groups_t *groups,\r\n                                         store_key_t &&key,\r\n                                         counted_t<const datum_t> &&sindex_val) {\r\n        for (auto it = groups->begin(); it != groups->end(); ++it) {\r\n            // ...\r\n            for (auto el = it->second.begin(); el != it->second.end(); ++el) {\r\n                keep |= accumulate(env,\r\n                                   *el,\r\n                                   &t_it->second,\r\n                                   std::move(key),\r\n                                   std::move(sindex_val));\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's right, it tries using std::move on the same objects over and over again in a for loop.  With a `counted_t<const datum_t>`, that makes a big difference.  I have no idea what the std::move is supposed to accomplish for a `store_key_t`."
