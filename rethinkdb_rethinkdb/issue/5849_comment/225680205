      "RethinkDB doesn't have any websocket interface. I assume your question applies to Horizon (which has its own issue tracker https://github.com/rethinkdb/horizon/issues ).\r\n\r\nCurrently Horizon uses engine.io , which might have a setting to tweak the heartbeats. Horizon doesn't explicitly expose the option, so you'd need to modify the Horizon client and/or Horizon server code.\r\n\r\nBe advised though that Horizon is going to switch away from engine.io . At that point there will be an option to control the frequency of hearbeats. See https://github.com/rethinkdb/horizon/issues/527"
