      "Ah, OK. This is what sparked the question (scaling)\r\n\r\nhttps://www.built.io/blog/2014/11/websockets-on-aws-elb/\r\n\r\nIn the comments from link:\r\n\r\n> This issues seems to be happening because of the Idle timeout for requests in Amazon\8217s ELB, which is by default, 60 seconds.\r\n> \r\n> You can find \8216Connection Settings\8217 attribute under \8216Description\8217 tab for ELB in AWS console. It can be modified as needed.\r\n> \r\n> You have also mentioned heartbeat mechanism is in place, in such case, you\8217d need to ensure heartbeat frequency is less than 60 seconds to avoid losing the WebSocket connection.\r\n> \r\n"
