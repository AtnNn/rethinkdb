      "This is also true for regular connections, FYI. I think this may be a combination of the following two issues:\r\n\r\n* Some coroutines don't yield for too long and monopolize a core\r\n* The coroutine queues get long on high load, and some things time out before the scheduler gets to them\r\n\r\nWe definitely need to get to the bottom of this because people care about this a lot. \r\n\r\n"
