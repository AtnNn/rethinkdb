      "Unfortunately this problem is not gone completely.\r\nI tried to reproduce #1387 on a machine with 4 cores (actually magneto with all but 4 turned off). I was inserting large documents of about 1 MB each from two concurrent clients.\r\nI didn't get the \"disconnected from cluster\" message, but the stats frequently timed out.\r\nThe CPU was not maxed out by the way. Definitely some latency issue."
