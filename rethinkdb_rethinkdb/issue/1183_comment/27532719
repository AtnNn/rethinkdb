      "This was possibly due to messages queuing up on the inter-cluster connections.\r\nThe stats had to go through the same message queue and become incredibly slow. I'm going to put a fix for this into code review soon as part of #1516.\r\n\r\nThere might be more to this issue though, I will have to test that later."
