From: Joe DolinerSent: Tuesday, September 17, 2013 7:05 PMTo: rethinkdb/rethinkdbReply To: rethinkdb/rethinkdbCc: Daniel MewesSubject: Re: [rethinkdb] delete_at does not accept right_bound optional argument (#1456)The optional argument part of that issue wasn't ever meant to apply to delete_at. There's really no reason you'd ever want that since delete_at(1,3,right_bound_closed=True) is much more concisely written as delete_at(1,4) I really don't think there's much reason to add this.\r\n\r\n\8212Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub."
