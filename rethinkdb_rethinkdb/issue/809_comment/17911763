      "So my understanding is that geolocation normally doesn't let you find nearest neighbor it lets you find all of the values inside of an `n` dimensional rectangle (for an `n` dimensional index). To do nearest neighbor you'd need some fuzzy matching. It's easy to think of your example query as a query for all the values within a 3 dimensional rectangle."
