      "@danielmewes I believe it does yes. When you feed a document into Elasticsearch, all the fields are indexed and can be used in a single query. Full-text search is something we may leverage down the road but all we need presently is fast retrieval when the filter fields are not always the same. Right now the only option in RethinkDb is to create a compound index for every combination, but when there's twenty fields it's not really viable."
