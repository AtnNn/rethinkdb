      "I'm no database expert, but I think this is an important issue for performance and for easier creation of performant queries without having to create a new index for every non-straightforward query that needs to be optimized.\r\n\r\nCurrently due to RethinkDB being able to use only one index in a query, the workaround most commonly given for creating performant queries is to create a new index spefically for that query. While it does result in a workable solution for many cases, I think it is somewhat offputting for people new to RethinkDB (at least for myself it was) and it requires a somewhat deep level of understanding of RethinkDB to know how to create the right index for different cases.... as can be seen from the amount of issues/questions related to 'how to make this query fast/create an index for it'.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the amount of different indexes required for all the different queries on some tables take up more space and affect write performance.\r\n\r\nSo I believe this issue should be given a higher priority."
