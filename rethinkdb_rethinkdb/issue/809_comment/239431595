      "@danielmewes thanks! yes euclidian multi-dimensional index would be the thing (any chance that will be supported in the future?)\r\n\r\nThanks for advise on how to reduce the effects on these issues.\r\n\r\nBy the way. What is the nature of these aberrations you refer to - lowered efficiency only, or could one even expect wrong results (false includes or excludes)? For context, I basically only need very simple queries of this type\r\n- every point (X,Y) where X > limit_X and Y < limit_Y"
