      "To add to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/809#issuecomment-63722165, I'm working on an app that needs to query *multiple multis* for combinations of tags (specifically, the multi index of tags and the multi index of recipients). Right now, it's doing that with a filter predicate with two `contains` (and ideally this would be enough for the server to understand it should use the indexes without having to `getAll`, but that might be a job for #4150)."
