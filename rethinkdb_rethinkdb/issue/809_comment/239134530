      "Hi folks\r\n\r\nI need efficient intersect of two indexes and I'm currently abusing the geo-index for this purpose. My problem though has nothing to do with geography; so I just need a carthesian coordinate system and an ability to specify a rectangular intersect. I'm able to do this just fine with the geo-index, but I just wanted to know if there could be any hidden costs with respect to the projections and spherical coordinates?\r\n\r\n- is getIntersect(rectangle) independent of complexity with projections/spherical stuff?\r\n- can I safely use the entire coordinate system (-90,90,-180,180) or should I stay away from the pole areas because of projections/spherical distances?\r\n\r\nThanks"
