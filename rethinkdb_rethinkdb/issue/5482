        "Hello,\r\n\r\nI recently changed my ReThinkDB setup to use a Proxy for the apps to connect too. We followed the docs to the point and it all seems to be working; but the web UI seems to be broken. (I'm assuming we connect to the web app via the proxy IP (as stated in the docs)) but this bug also affects the other cluster instances running on the server.\r\n\r\nThis is the error being thrown in the console.\r\n![xp4l-ed06f-1457086481](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1885466/13524243/f83e2aca-e1f1-11e5-8898-3ee5b6c04596.png)\r\n\r\nI believe all the configs are correct as the database is running fine, just the panel pretty much useless for some reason.\r\n\r\nWe are running version: `2.2.5` and Ubuntu `14.04` on the connected servers. (All running the same RethinkDB version) The data explorer works fine however just the rest of the pages / stats not working due to some odd error. (Not sure if the console error is related but it started when we moved to the proxy setup)\r\n\r\nIf you need more information about the setup please do ask. Really looking to find out if this is something I'm doing wrong or a bug with the panel.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKieron"
