IMO we should use `and` and `or` in every language that allows it, and use something similar (like `and_` or something) in languages that don't.  We should also support the shortcuts `&` and `|` in languages that allow it.\r\n\r\nScheduling for backlog; let's try to avoid discussing this until we schedule it for a sprint."
