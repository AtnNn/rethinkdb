      "@coffeemug A developer id is a way to sign the package without putting it in the Mac App Store. So the package is only 'trusted'. Since the default setting in OS X is 'Trust only apps from the Mac App Store or with a Developer ID' this would be more user-friendly.\r\n\r\nI'm OS X developer with a paid membership, but I've neither signed an app using a Developer nor built a `.pkg`."
