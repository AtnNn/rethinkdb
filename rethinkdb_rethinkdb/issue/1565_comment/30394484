      "I don't think putting Rethink in the mac app store is a good idea. That violates my expectations as a user, I wouldn't, for example, go there to get nginx or something. I do, of course, think it's a good idea to sign the package.\r\n\r\nIt's really up to @atnnn -- if it's easy to do in our dmg build process, we should do it when we can."
