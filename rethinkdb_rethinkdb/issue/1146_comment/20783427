      "Could we move this out of 1.8-optional?  Having it in 1.8 optional means we're going to start debating it right away.\r\n\r\nI feel like we've drifted away from the original motivation for time-boxing, which was allowing us to have one period where we argue about RQL things and another where we can actually get work done on the things we've agreed on.  (I think big, contentious issues like dates might be worth cheating on, but not things like this.)\r\n\r\n(Also, note that I'm frequently guilty of this proposal creep myself, so please call me on it if you see me doing that.)"
