      "I just tried to reproduce that, and could not.\r\n\r\nI have a docker container running with RethinkDB (official dockerfile) . Sending queries from my localhost (outside the container), or another server (outside my local machine), I don't see any performance issue.\r\n\r\nI tried both scenario: sequential inserts and parallel inserts. Maybe there is a bug in older versions of Docker? Or something that doesn't work well with old-ish kernels?\r\n\r\nI'm running Arch\r\n```\r\nLinux t520 3.16.3-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Sep 17 21:54:13 CEST 2014 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n```\r\nAnd docker 1.2"
