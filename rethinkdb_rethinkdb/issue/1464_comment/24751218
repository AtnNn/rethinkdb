      "Hello @VanCoding, thanks for the feedback (and taking some time to write this proposal).\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not sure to get the whole scope of your suggestion. Is it just about passing functions in `indexCreate`?\r\nIf that's your suggestion, you can already do it\r\n\r\nThe examples on the docs ( http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/secondary-indexes/ ) use `r.row` but they can be replaced with an anonymous function.\r\n\r\n"
