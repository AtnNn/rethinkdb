      "The proposal is pretty much about combining multiindices and compound indices to one feature. I know that it's currently possible to pass a function to indexCreate, but I think it's a bit confusing how it works.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind my idea is to give the developer the as much flexibility as possible. With a function that generates an array of values to index the document to, the developer has such flexibility. The count of values is flexible, the value itself is completely flexible etc."
