      "Huge +1 for this. It would potentially allow us to extend ReQL with things like #3353, #4187, and others which can be implemented as rewrites to existing terms.\r\n\r\n@neumino already has something similar to this in `thinky`, but currently you can only define extension methods per-model not on the driver itself."
