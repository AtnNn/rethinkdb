      "The current \"r.js has the same semantics as eval\" does inherit any confusion already associated with `eval` but it also inherits all of the institutional memory associated with JS `eval` that even people who have never used JS (indeed, especially them) can benefit from. There is no `evalExpression` in the V8 API and any attempt we make to hack it together will be subject to problems that don't already have solutions plastered all over the web."
