      "@mlucy I'm not an expert in JavaScript, but skimming through the specification it seems to me that there is a chance one could even proof that no such expression exists. New lines seem to get \"separated\" from other characters very early in the parsing, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find out exactly where in the grammar a newline character can have an influence.\r\nSo maybe it wouldn't be as difficult as I first thought. \r\nBut then again there's always the chance of missing something.\r\n\r\nAs @atnnn just pointed out there should be plenty of ways to use *invalid* expressions to trigger misleading error messages in this context. Not sure how much of a problem this would be for users."
