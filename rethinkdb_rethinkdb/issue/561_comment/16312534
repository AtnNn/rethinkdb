      "Because in the current implementation we can document the feature as providing JavaScript eval and need not say anything more. Otherwise we are providing something entirely different, a JavaScript expression evaluator, which we now have to figure out how to implement properly and document properly.\r\n\r\nNow the onus is on us to provide support to confused users rather than being able to rely on an internet's worth of documentation for regular JavaScript evaluation. Even worse, our confused users will only get themselves more confused when they try to google their problem and come across the 99.999% of documentation out there for regular JavaScript and miss the 0.001% of documentation out there for RethinkDB's JavaScript expression evaluator.\r\n\r\nUsers will inevitably be more creative with using this functionality than we have been in our limited testing. They *will* write much larger programs and try to pass them to `r.js`. They *will* try to plug in JavaScript snippets from other sources that don't follow our rules and *will* resort to costly and fragile workarounds after struggling for hours trying to figure out why otherwise valid JS (the internet told them so) doesn't seem to work in RethinkDB."
