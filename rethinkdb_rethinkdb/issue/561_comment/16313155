      "So this might be an inelegant suggestion but what if we did the following:\r\n\r\n- leave the code as it is now, things will fail when users forget parens.\r\n- everytime a piece of javascript fails we try running it with parens added.\r\n- if it still fails with parens added we just return a normal error message.\r\n- if it succeeds with parens added we give them the error but add a note that they probably just need to add parens.\r\n\r\nThis way we avoid magic, which has the chance to make things very confusing (albeit for a small number of people probably). But we make it unlikely that someone will be stuck and confused about this for a long time. It seems like it has a lesser version of the upside but with a lot less downside."
