      "This entire thread arguing about the technical possibility of doing this is pointless because @wmrowan's first reply is the right answer.\r\n\r\nEven if the conversation didn't end with gotchyas about how wrapping things in parentheses would cause worse confusion, it would still be a bad idea because such a finish to the conversation doesn't mean such gotchyas don't exist.  The rest of the thread is people entertaining each other's inability to reason with incomplete information.\r\n\r\nTrying to make a friendlier error message is a better solution."
