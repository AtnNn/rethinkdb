      "That's a very reasonable argument, but the other side of it is that right now `r.js` is the only way to do a lot of things in RQL, which means that a lot of non-javascript people are going to be using it.  Making them deal with random javascript \"quirks\" (read: swearword of your choice) seems like a poor user experience.\r\n\r\nWhat's an example of something somebody would want to put in `r.js` that wouldn't work correctly if we wrapped all strings starting with the substring `function` in parentheses?  (Or some other reasonable heuristic.)"
