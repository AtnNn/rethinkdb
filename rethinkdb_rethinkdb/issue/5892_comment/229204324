      "It would be great if RethinkDB was faster to build and package by default.\r\n\r\nHowever forcing ``-j`nproc``` may break for older versions of make (see #475). Make might also warn that\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake[1]: warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn alternative might be to pass `-jauto` to `dpkg-buildpackage` in [`mk/packaging.mk`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/mk/packaging.mk#L100). It would be easier for users who don't or can't build with `-j` to work around the forced parallelism."
