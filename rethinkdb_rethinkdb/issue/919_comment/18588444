      "Well, you're still going to have to lower both of them. And if you let people lower the replicas first then you've let them introduce a different unsatisfiable goal issue which they're going to need to solve before they can do anything.  I think it's better to just prevent people from making acks lower replicas at all times since it always creates an issue that they're going to need to solve before they can proceed."
