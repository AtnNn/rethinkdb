      "I did not know about new convention, I'll do that right away.\r\nFor suggestion 2, I can add a helper function as per your recommendation but I am not really sure where exactly to that in `error.hpp`. There are some classes and I am not sure where exactly this function will fit in. \r\n\r\nThanks @danielmewes ."
