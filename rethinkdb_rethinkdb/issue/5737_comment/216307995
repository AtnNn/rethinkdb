      "Thanks @dineyw23 . The new error message looks good to me.\r\n\r\nTwo suggestions:\r\n1. We try to use two spaces after each period in ReQL error messages. This isn't done completely consistently right now, but new messages should follow the convention. So \"Array over size limit `%zu`. To [...]\" Should be \"Array over size limit `%zu`.  To [...]\".\r\n2. The error message is currently copied four times. Maybe you could add a helper function `std::string format_array_size_error(size_t limit)` to `rdb_protocol/error.hpp` to contain the error message?"
