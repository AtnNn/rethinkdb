        "Been looking at one of my servers thats dual core and running the web ui and i pretty much all day keep it the cluster overview page open just so i can take a peak at stuff. I was noticing that my node had about 20% cpu usage all the time and also was using about 1MB/s all the time. I closed the tab accdently and noticed when i checked my monitoring that there was a huge drop in network and cpu pretty much nothing. I am guessing since i have a 12 or 13 node rethinkdb cluster there is a lot of meta data for the ajax api that has to keep being moved around and other things But wanted to make everyone aware.\n"
