      "I agree we should fix this.  I also agree that it isn't critical.  In this case, fixing it might be as easy as adding the `LITERAL_OK` flag to some function calls in the body of `object_term_t::eval_impl`.  I think we should put this in backlog, and if someone has some time free to work on random ReQL issues they can pick it up."
