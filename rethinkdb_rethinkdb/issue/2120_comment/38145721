      "Yes I would. The more general issue here is that `{a: foo}` and `r.object(\"a\", foo)` should be indistinguishable for every value of `foo`.\r\n\r\nAn even more general principle is consistency. Two things that appear to be the same should have the same semantics. This is the reason for other issues like #2035 and #1032. It leads to a cleaner, less surprising and less error-prone query language. It also often leads to a better implementation. The current implementation of `r.literal` is not very elegant and difficult to maintain (#1291, #1957).\r\n\r\nSorry if I seem to be ranting. These inconsistencies in ReQL literally keep me up at night. I think you dismiss them too easily."
