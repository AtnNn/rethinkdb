      "> These inconsistencies in ReQL literally keep me up at night. I think you dismiss them too easily.\r\n\r\nI wish I could convey the extent to which ReQL inconsistencies bother me, on so many levels. I hate them because they're inelegant, they confuse users, and they're a slippery slope (if there is one inconsistency, what's another one?; if there are two, what's two more?). It brings me great joy to fix them, and it pains me every time one slips between the cracks. It pains me even more when I know of one, but am forced not to schedule a fix. \r\n\r\nI go through a great deal of internal struggle when I ask to close an issue, or choose not to schedule one. When I dismiss consistency issues, I do it because before we get to enjoy the privilege to the level of polish we want to see, we have to earn the right to survive. If we do the latter, we'll get to do the former. If we don't manage to do the latter, doing the former won't matter -- nobody will be around to notice.\r\n\r\nOur right to survive is bestowed by the users, and it's my job to interpret their wishes. Given our limited resources, and the great importance of haste, I'm often forced to choose between our survival and our sensibilities; given the choice, no matter how much it pains me personally, I'll always choose survival. I didn't always know to do that, and it was my biggest error; if I knew to do it all along, we'd be far, far ahead of where we are now. May be even far enough ahead to start optimizing for sensibilities because survival is out of danger. I can't give the 2011 @coffeemug a call and tell him that, but I can remind the 2014 @coffeemug of this.\r\n\r\nSo please don't misunderstand me, I care about language inconsistencies a great deal and I try to fight like hell for consistency during scheduling (often with my own self). But I have to sift through hundreds of important and urgent problems every day, technical and non-technical, knowing that we can only solve five or ten, and I have to struggle with figuring out which are on the critical path to survival, and which ones are distracting us from that path, if only for a moment, which we can't afford. As much as it makes me unhappy to admit this to myself, many of the ReQL inconsistencies are little temptations along the path that for the time being we have to have the discipline to ignore.\r\n\r\n(I'm also ranting since this problem also keeps me up at night, so apologies for venting)"
