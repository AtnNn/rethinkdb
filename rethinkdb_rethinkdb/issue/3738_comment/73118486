      "I've built heroku buildpacks in the past, but usually they aren't a good fit for something like a database because Heroku's drives are mounted read-only when they're deployed. I assume cloudfoundry has other buildpacks for databases?\r\n\r\nIf you want to get started now, compose.io has instructions for using them with Heroku: https://docs.compose.io/partners/heroku.html"
