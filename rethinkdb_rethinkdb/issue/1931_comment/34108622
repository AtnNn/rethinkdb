      "@atnnn are we currently doing any testing on each platform before a release (e.g. running the unit tests)?\r\n\r\nThere is always a chance that a certain version of GCC generates wrong code of course.\r\nI don't think that `-flto` is significantly more risky than other optimizations. I guess what I'm actually saying is that I'm not aware of any piece of code that relies on functions not being inlined (except for some multi-threading related parts, which are already tagged as NOINLINE). That doesn't necessarily mean that there is no such piece of code. Still I think we should compile with `-flto` as soon as possible. If any problems show up, we can still fix those before the LTS release."
