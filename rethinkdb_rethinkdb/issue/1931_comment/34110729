      "No. The tests are run before every release on OS X 10.9 and on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit. Perhaps I should add the other platforms we distribute packages for, such as OS X 10.7, 10.8, Ubuntu 10.04+, Centos 6 and at least one 32-bit platform.\r\n\r\nHowever, most of those platforms are not affected by this issue because they use gcc < 4.5 or clang."
