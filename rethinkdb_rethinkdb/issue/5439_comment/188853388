      "@pires, there's a subtle bug in the code when processing exceptions this way.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/java/src/main/java/com/rethinkdb/net/Connection.java#L139\r\n\r\nAfter the pump is finished processing a response cleanly, suppose the connection drops outside of the `try{}catch{}` statement. The pump isn't around to catch it. `!isOpen` is `true`. The `while(true)` loop breaks in **Line 145**. `.close` is never called. Hence, leaving all awaiting queries hanging. The .NET driver does clean up outside of the `while(true)` loop."
