      "@bchavez yes it does, but in a different manner.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/java/src/main/java/com/rethinkdb/net/SocketWrapper.java#L129\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/java/src/main/java/com/rethinkdb/net/Connection.java#L155\r\n\r\nI believe having the _awaiter_ facility in `SocketWrapper` is misleading. `SocketWrapper` in Java is responsible for socket management and (de)serialization stuff only. `Connection` is the one handling all the hurdle around multi-threading, etc. Hence, this is where I put the logic about handling network exceptions there."
