      "@cd34 are you using any non-standard package sources and/or backports?\r\nIndeed it seems like https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libprotobuf9 is still in jessie, while `libprotobuf9v5` doesn't yield any results in the package search:\r\nhttps://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libprotobuf9v5&searchon=names&suite=jessie&section=all\r\n\r\nClosing this for now, since it doesn't look like a bug on our end. But we can re-open it in case that turns out to be false."
