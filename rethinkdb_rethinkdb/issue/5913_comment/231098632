      "**Status Update:**\r\n\r\nRan the query above that counted the rows.  All tables were fine - but they were sharded between db-1 and db-2\r\n\r\nAt this point, we reset db-3 -- and re-added it to the cluster. Things seemed fine until we sharded the tables on to db-3.  Which produced: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5923"
