      "@bsharpe We would probably need the full data to debug this. 600 GB is quite a lot though. Is the data distributed over multiple tables or is it essentially one big table?\r\n\r\nIf you can find out which table is affected, the data file of that table would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB data files also usually compress pretty well, so the final file size is hopefully going to be significantly less than 600 GB (though it could still be significant)."
