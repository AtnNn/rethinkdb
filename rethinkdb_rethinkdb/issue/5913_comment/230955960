      "On first sight, after looking at the code surrounding this, it seems as if this particular crash `Guarantee failed: [node_weight < sibling_weight]` is impossible. Obviously that can't be right, so I must be missing something subtle. We'll investigate further.\r\n\r\n@bsharpe Even though it seems highly unlikely that all three (or at least two) of your servers would have such an issue, I'd recommend running a RAM checker on the servers if possible. That way we can definitely rule out bad RAM as a cause of this.\r\n\r\nYou said that you installed RethinkDB as described in our docs. So you're using the packages from our APT repository? (we also have a page in our docs on how to compile from source on Ubuntu)"
