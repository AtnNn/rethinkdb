Installed fresh.\r\nServers run on raw hardware (at Packet.net -- Type 2)\r\n*File System:* XFS\r\n\r\nWhich part of the db would you need sent?   the metadata? or the whole thing? (~600G)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso -- FWIW -- db-2 has been running now for 24 hrs with db-1 -- there have been 2 exits in that time.\r\n\r\nSounds like we need to:\r\n- do a full backup \r\n- remove datastorage directories from all 3 machines\r\n- restart all 3\r\n- restore data to the new cluster of 3\r\n\r\nWhich involves considerable downtime for a production app.\r\n"
