      "I agree with @danielmewes that we shouldn't special case `0` and have `limit(0)` return zero documents, that's what you've asked for after all. Adding support for `limit(null)` on the other hand sounds reasonable.\r\n\r\nNot sure what `nth(null)` would do though, and I'm not sure there's much use for a `skip(null)` that skips all documents either."
