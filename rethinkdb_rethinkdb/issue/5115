        "`eqJoin` could be by an order of magnitude faster if we batched multiple lookups into a single multi-key `getAll`.\n\nAs an example: Consider the query described in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5109 . By rewriting the first `eqJoin` in that query into a `table2.getAll(r.args(table1.....coerceTo('array')))`, I could get the execution time of that part down from 35 ms to 4 ms.\n"
