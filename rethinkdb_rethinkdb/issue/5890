        "Users of MongoDB can get continuous backup using [Ops Manager](https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager) (self-hosted) or [Cloud Manager](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud) (fully managed). Both use the same underlying software.\n\n> Ops Manager continuously maintains backups, so if your MongoDB deployment experiences a failure, the most recent backup is only moments behind, minimizing exposure to data loss. Ops Manager is the only MongoDB solution that offers point-in-time backups of replica sets and cluster-wide snapshots of sharded clusters. You can restore to precisely the moment you need, quickly and safely.\n\nSource: https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager\n\nThe MongoDB documentation has more [details about how Ops Manager Backup works](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/application/#backup).\n\nAre there any plans to create similar functionality for RethinkDB?\n"
