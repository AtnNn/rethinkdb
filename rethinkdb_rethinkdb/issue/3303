        "We initiated a rebalance after re-pinning a shard to a new host, the replication was very speedy in the beginning, but now it's a magnitude slower. It seems to be due to a ton of very small writes on a single host. The two other hosts are relatively idle. This has made the host under high load and unresponsive to other requests, which does not seem right. We have upgraded our servers and SSDs to be dedicated to the databases. Here's the hardware and software configuration below:\r\n\r\nServer Info:\r\nIntel Xeon E5-2660 4 cores\r\n60GB of RAM (50GB configured as cache for RethinkDB) 256G DD3-1600\r\n200GB SSD drive partition - Raid 1 - Samsung\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69432/4942627/881a15aa-65ed-11e4-8586-10ba72c7a699.png)\r\n\r\nHere is what iostat is saying about the one host.\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69432/4942628/8dfbd328-65ed-11e4-9c94-2464528e5c9c.png)"
