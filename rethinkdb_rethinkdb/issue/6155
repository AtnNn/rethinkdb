        "Hi - we were vetting rethinkdb. We loaded some data to a table, built 3 secondary indexes on the table, ran a few queries against it. \n\nWe ran`count()` query which took a long time to run and seemed to \"lock up\" the table from further querying.\n\nWhile we were investigating this issue we suddenly noticed that all the indexes dissapeared. Also, on the table page, we now saw that it says \"Uknown documents\"\n\n<img width=\"336\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-10-24 at 9 26 33 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/763803/19669844/970b7ef4-9a30-11e6-8ebc-b36b3d15c3cc.png\">\n\nObviously, this is really strange and disturbing. \n\nWhat are some ways to debug this and try to figure out what might have happened? I saw nothing in the logs on the web UI. I logged into the nodes and checked the logs there but also nothing interesting. I checked out the `jobs` and `stats` system tables but also nothing to elucidating.\n"
