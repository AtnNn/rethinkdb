      "@mbroadst, I believe this is expected behavior.  The field you told the query to order by is identical for those two rows, so their order does not matter.  If you want another field to be a tie-breaker, you can specify multiple fields to `orderBy`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.db('test').table('user').orderBy('username', 'email').run(connection, cb);\r\n```"
