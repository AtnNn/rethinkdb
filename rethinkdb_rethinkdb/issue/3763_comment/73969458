      "@danielmewes I ran into a problem with `new_mutex_acq_t` resulting in two coroutines having the lock - the problem went away using `new_mutex_in_line_t` directly.  Since what I was working with was the only code in `next` using `new_mutex_acq_t`, I thought it would be fine to remove it.  @timmaxw apparently is using it in his branch, so I'll unremove it and try to debug it."
