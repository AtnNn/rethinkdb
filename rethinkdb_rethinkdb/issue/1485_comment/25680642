      "I think we're going to have to address the performance impact of this eventually. Sooner or later (in reality, this will be later), we're going to start bubbling up into bigger and bigger use cases (possibly hundreds or thousands of tables, lots of machines), and we'll have to fix the bottleneck.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes -- if you'd like, you could create another issue restating the problem (but not necessarily the solution -- it does seem like jumping to conclusions a bit, although you could mention it as a hint). We'll run into this eventually though. This issue will be pretty much impossible to miss, so you don't have to open a new one."
