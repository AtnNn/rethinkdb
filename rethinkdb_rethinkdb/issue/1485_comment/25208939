      "Holding on to the deletes indefinitely is a very core part of our metadata system that's not going to change.\r\n\r\nI think there's some other problem going on if this is having a noticeable effect on performance it only takes 16 bytes to record the delete. And I think it's very unlikely that a user is ever going to have on the order of 100s of deleted databases/tables so we're talking about less than a kilobyte of data to be saved here.\r\n\r\nThere are other issues about speed improvements in metadata operations so I'm closing this because garbage collecting is something that's not possible to do."
