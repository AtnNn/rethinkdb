      "I don't see why that would not be possible in a fully connected cluster. I don't know enough about the implementation details to say if it is difficult or trivial, but I don't see any theoretical argument against it. The only information which we might not be able to ever purge is information about dead nodes I suppose.\r\n\r\nAs I said, this is definitely very low priority.\r\n\r\nIn my benchmark this is very noticeable. But the benchmark is clearly artificial (I create and drop a database 1000 times)."
