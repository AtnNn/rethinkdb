      "Since commit 4ee5a779234c89eb4423b44f727f70942e1b6c13 what we are doing now is\r\n- Check if the browser is Internet Explorer, in which case we say that we don't support Internet explorer.\r\n- Check if DataView and Uint8Array are defined, if not we tell the user to upgrade his browser.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo from what I have tested, the data explorer (and the javascript driver) works for\r\nFirefox >= 15\r\nOpera >=1.62\r\nChrome >= 9\r\nSafari >= 6.02 (I couldn't try the old version because os x doesn't let me try it)\r\n\r\nSo it doesn't work at all for Internet Explorer even IE 10 (even though DataView and Uint8Array are defined) It looks like IE doesn't transfer some methods in prototype but I haven't tried to dig more.\r\nI haven't try browsers like Flock, Shiira etc... I think it's enough for now.\r\n\r\nI'll open an issue for rethinkdb-www to give a little more information about what we support and what we don't.\r\n\r\nClosing."
