      "You're using a older version of firefox that likely doesn't support the DataView object. If you try to construct this object in your firefox console do you get an error? I've tested the driver on the latest versions of both chrome and firefox and can confirm that it works in both. Upgrading firefox to the latest should probably solve this error.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we can't really commit to supporting older browser versions, certainly not anything that doesn't support DataView. I have no idea what IE support looks like for DataView but I'm guessing that that would be the least of our problems.\r\n\r\nWe should probably feature test DataView and throw a nice error if your browser doesn't support it."
