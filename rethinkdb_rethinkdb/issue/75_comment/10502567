      "@chrisdotcode -- thanks for reporting the bug, sorry you're encountering issues. Did you get any warnings or errors during the build process? Could you describe a little more precisely how you built the server and how you ran it?\r\n\r\nThis error typically means that the javascript drivers didn't build properly (the data explorer uses the javascript drivers to execute queries). Specifically, it looks like something went wrong with the protocol buffer compilation step. If you could build again from source and paste the output of the make process here, it would be very helpful (you might also want to pass VERBOSE=1 to make)."
