      "One way to implement this from a UI point of view is to have a flag called `automation` or something in `table_config`. It would have values `\"off\"` and `\"backfill\"`. When we introduce auto-failover, it could be a third value of the flag.\r\n\r\nEdit: So setting the flag to `\"off\"` would interrupt running backfills. Setting the flag back to `\"backfill\"` would resume them."
