      "Hmm, I feel like the designated follow up #186 doesn't address the filter issue, does it?\r\nFiltering is briefly mentioned in the initial description, but then there only seems to be discussion about modifications of embedded documents.\r\nThe issues mentioned in #186 as the follow-up issues are also about modifying data as far as I can see.\r\n\r\nThis just came up in a private discussion with a user again. The thing which is confusing here is that you can use the {field: 'value'} shortcut for non-embedded documents, but then you have to use a pretty different style for writing your filter for embedded documents."
