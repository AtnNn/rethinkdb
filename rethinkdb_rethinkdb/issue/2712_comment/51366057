      "Welp, see #2789.  Anyway, I've had lots of look at how datums are serialized.  One concern is allowing strings to have null characters (right now they can't) but we can add that in the future with an alternate type prefix and by using a non-lexicographic store_key_t comparison function.  Generally speaking, type prefixes make the format future-compatible if you're willing to use something other than sized_strcmp to compare keys."
