        "Currently `rget_read_t`s use snapshots, even when `include_initial` is set. This is incorrect, and @mlucy has a fix for that in review 3386 that will ship with the next point release.\n\nHowever it looks like we can easily re-enable snapshots, while still being correct. All we need to do is delay calling `snapshot_subdag()` on the superblock until after we've acquired the changefeed stamps.\n\nI think this is fairly important, since non-snapshotted range reads suck for concurrency (especially on out-of-memory data sets).\n"
