      "Do you mean that the error also happens in release, just that we caught it in debug because we use `rassert` there? If so, that's what I thought, which means we have more work to do than what I anticipated. I just originally thought that ReQL tests in debug mode only expose silly errors that are problems with the test framework, not with the product itself, which isn't the case."
