      "@anatol -- thanks for reporting this. I believe the V8 API changed across versions. We're either going to have to fetch our own version of v8, or support both APIs in the codebase (for all the distros that didn't upgrade).\r\n\r\nPinging @wmrowan and @atnnn. What do you guys think we should do about this?"
