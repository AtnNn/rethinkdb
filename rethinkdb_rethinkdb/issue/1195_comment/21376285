      "@anatol I'm not exactly sure what interface changes were made with the update. Is this just the final removal of deprecated API's? If that's the case then we should be able to move to the more recent API introduced in an earlier version of V8 without breaking anything. I would be surprised if they added a new interface and removed the old one in a single release."
