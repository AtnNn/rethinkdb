      "Most of our users will not have the most recent v8. For example, here are the versions of libv8-dev avaiable on Ubuntu:\r\n\r\n* lucid: 2.0.3-2: amd64 i386\r\n* precise: 3.7.12.22-3: amd64 i386\r\n* quantal: 3.8.9.20-2: amd64 i386\r\n* raring: 3.8.9.20-2: amd64 i386\r\n\r\n3.8 is a lot older than 3.19\r\n\r\nI would prefer doing some ifdefing to stay compatible with the old version of v8."
