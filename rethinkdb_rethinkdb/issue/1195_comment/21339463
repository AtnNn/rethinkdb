      "In general Arch does not recommend to fetch or link to third-party version of the system package. Everyone should use HEAD and 'v8' is currently at version  '3.19.18.4' https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/i686/v8/\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution for me is if you provide a patch that adopts rethinkdb to this v8 version. You don't need to submit it to github - I can temporary add the patch to my package. Later, when you upgrade v8, you'll submit the patch to repo and I remove it from my package."
