      "The current status of this is that the branch hierarchy is now `next -> sam_1328_i -> sam_1328_ii -> sam_1328_iii -> sam_1328`.  The commit 22b8d77 mentioned above is the difference between sam_1328_ii and sam_1328_iii.  It's the main commit, the hard part of this issue.  What's left in this issue is some cleanup work, a bunch of low-risk scud work and such."
