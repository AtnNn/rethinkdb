      "I think `group_format: 'native'` in JS should produce the same output we had before:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[{\r\n  group: 1,\r\n  reduction: 'foo'\r\n},\r\n{\r\n  group: 2,\r\n  reduction: 'bar'\r\n}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not ideal, but much better than the raw format returned from the server IMO.\r\n\r\nWe could also add a `'json_key'` format, but I feel like that's a separate feature and we shouldn't worry about it until there is some evidence that there would be a demand for such a thing."
