      "@mjhea0 Generally the driver should have the same major version (up to the first number after the period) as the server.\r\n\r\nIf you are talking specifically about the conversion from a protocol buffer to a JSON based protocol, then the rule is \r\n* IF driver >= 1.13 THEN use server >= 1.13\r\n\r\nAll servers up to the current one still support the old protocol buffer protocol.\r\nHowever whenever we add new terms to ReQL or modify how existing ones work (e.g. they take an additional argument), the drivers need updating. If there's a mismatch, queries sometimes fail in non-obvious ways. This is what we would like to warn about as part of this issue."
