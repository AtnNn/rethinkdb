      "Rather than changing the magic number for each release, we should probably send the server version separately as part of the handshake. We would increase the magic once to signal that a client can handle the new version field.\r\n\r\nAs @neumino says, the driver could print an info or warning message to the log if it detects a mismatch between its own and the server's version. I'm a little bit concerned that this could generate too many log messages and have an impact on a server's performance and in extreme cases disk space usage. Also we wouldn't want to print these messages to stdout or stderr, since that could break users' applications.\r\n\r\nOnce we get https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2106 sorted out, there is also an alternative option:\r\nIf the driver detects that it is outdated, it doesn't do anything at first. However whenever it generates an error, it appends a message such as \" Note: You are using an outdated driver. If you think that this error might be the result of using a recently added ReQL feature, we recommend updating to the latest driver.\".\r\nDoing this before #2106 would be bad, because the changed error message would break users' error handling procedures (which have to perform string matching of the error message right now, due to a lack of alternatives). However I think it could be nice at a later point."
