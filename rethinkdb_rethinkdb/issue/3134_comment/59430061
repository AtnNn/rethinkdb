      "@mjhea0 made another suggestion in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3195#issue-45992903, which I quite like: The server could print a warning if a driver that is too new or too old connects to it. That has the advantage that we could very easily throttle the rate at which these warnings get printed (e.g. just once per day or something), since servers are typically not restarted all the time (in contrast to drivers)."
