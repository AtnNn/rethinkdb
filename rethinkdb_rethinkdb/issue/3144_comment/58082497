      "It would allow using non-static keys in objects.\r\n\r\nI ran into this in Haskell, which does not have native object literals. I tried exposing only the `OBJECT` constructor because it was more general, but because of `LITERAL` that did not work.\r\n\r\nThis change might also benefit other drivers such as the Python driver:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> r.expr({r.expr(\"a\"): 1}).run()\r\nRqlDriverError: Object keys must be strings.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhether this is a good idea in Python depends on how `dict` hashes and compares `RqlQuery` instances."
