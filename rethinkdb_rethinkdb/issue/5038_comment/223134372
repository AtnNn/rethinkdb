      "@danielmewes I can see that \"at least once\" would be more complex to implement. Figuring out how long to wait is definitely something to think about, but without this type of validation, change feed groups feel a bit like playing Russian roulette. And that would be especially dangerous if one wanted to build an application which require change feeds at their core, for example the real time market place: if we wanted to push out updates for an item's price to our users and we're using a 3rd party pubsub provider, then we definitely don't want to send out the message twice, because that might cost us quite a bit if there are a lot of connected users. Another problematic thing would be if we need to send out emails when a certain prop for a document changed - those emails shouldn't be sent out twice."
