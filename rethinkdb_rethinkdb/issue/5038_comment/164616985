      "We haven't made progress on the issue. The good news is that this isn't very hard to do; the bad news is that we have a really deep pipeline of features that's quite challenging to prioritize. We'll try to get this scheduled ASAP. I'll talk to @danielmewes about our release plans, we'll possibly reshuffle a few things, and I'll report back."
