      "@johanneslumpe Well in general there are the two options of \"at most once\" and \"at least once\" delivery. Without an ACK, this would provide \"at most once\" delivery, and indeed messages could get lost if a client fails in the wrong moment as you say.\r\nWe could add some form of client ack to allow for \"at least once\" delivery, though it's significantly more complicated. For example there's the question of how long the server should wait for a client to acknowledge a message before it assumes that the message got lost etc,"
