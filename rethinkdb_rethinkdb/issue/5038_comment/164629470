      "TBH, I don't think so (although a sufficiently driven, smart person could *probably* get it done). There is an enormous amount of knowhow locked up in the codebase and the minds of experienced RethinkDB developers. If you have the knowhow, implementing this is pretty easy; if you don't, it's impossibly hard.\r\n\r\nOne of our goals for 2016 is to make the db server codebase more accessible (via documenting internals, writing contributor tutorials, etc.) but unfortunately for now it feels a little bit like voodoo magic to new contributors."
