      "I had a dirty tree and preferred to simply disable the test so we would stop getting useless build failure emails.\r\n\r\nAdding a timeout seems to me like the right solution.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the long term, we should use the test driver in test/common/. It is easy to use (but possibly undocumented) and has lots of nice features (such as waiting for the server to be up, spawning clusters and generating netsplits). Parts of this test driver have been reimplemented at various other places in the test suite."
