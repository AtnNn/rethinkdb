      "A `RuntimeError` is anything that happens at runtime (so the driver sent the query correctly and the query compiled correctly, and now we're running it).\r\n\r\nLogic errors are runtime errors that are produced by incorrect query logic -- e.g. trying to add a number to a string.  This makes them distinct from errors caused by e.g. a netsplit.  If you get a logic error, it 100% means you need to rewrite your query (or possibly change your data).  This makes them distinct from the other errors -- resource errors can be fixed by bumping up your limits, availability errors can be fixed by resolving netsplits, and internal / timeout errors aren't really your fault.  (Arguably `UserError` should be a subset of `LogicError`, but it isn't because user errors are usually produced by the query working as intended and aborting in a certain circumstance rather than the query being incorrect.)"
