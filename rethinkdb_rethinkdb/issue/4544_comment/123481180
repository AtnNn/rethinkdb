      "Side note on `ReqlTimeoutError`: As of Python3.3 the `TimeoutError` has been added and I have added code (0b84b94) to make our current `RqlTimeoutError` use it as a base class where possible.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of new [`OSError` subclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#os-exceptions), a couple of them might be worth doing the same thing for in the new model. Most notably we would probably want `ReqlDriverError` and `ReqlAuthError` to be (additionally) subclassed from `ConnectionError`."
