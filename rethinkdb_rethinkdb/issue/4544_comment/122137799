      "Logic errors might be better called ReQL logic errors.  Adding a number to a string for example.  Accessing a field that doesn't exist seems like a ReQL logic error to me (the same way trying to add a number to a field that's a string is a ReQL logic error).  Non-existence errors are basically the subset of logic errors that we decided we wanted `default` to handle."
