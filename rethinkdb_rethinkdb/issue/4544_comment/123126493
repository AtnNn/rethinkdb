      "`QueryLogicError` works for me.  (It's interesting that worked for both this case and `ResourceLimitError`.\r\n\r\nAlso, as long as we're renaming things, we should take this opportunity to change `Rql -> Reql`.  We've been meaning to do that for ~2 years (the exception names were chosen before we standardized on ReQL as the abbreviation)."
