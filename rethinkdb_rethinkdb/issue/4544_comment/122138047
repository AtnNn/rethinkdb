      "Thanks @mlucy.\r\nThese seem generally reasonable to me, with the exception that I'd like to find a better name for logic errors. I'll try to come up with some suggestions.\r\nI also wonder if there's a better word to use instead of `op`/`operation`, since those terms can mean different things (like you can think of a ReQL term as an operation, or `op` could even be short for `operator`)."
