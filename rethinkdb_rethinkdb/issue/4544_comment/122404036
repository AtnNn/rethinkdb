      "We had an off-line conversation amongst a few of us in the office. Here are the points I got from that:\r\n\r\n- The best argument for `RqlNonExistenceError` is so that programs can distinguish when a particular record is missing a value whit having to list the keys and check that. So I am in agreement to separate those.\r\n\r\n- More thinking is probably needed about subclasses of `RqlAvailabilityError`. All three of the proposals are logically equivalent, and so the lead argument might be the difficulty of getting good names for the subclasses.\r\n\r\n- The argument to combine `RqlCompileError` and `RqlLogicError` now rather than later is that it would be easier for developers to have one big change to adapt to rather than two smaller ones.\r\n\r\n- A possible strategy around `RqlQueryError` and `RqlCompileError` would be to alias them together. @danielmewes though that there might be cases where people were deliberately using these distinctions. That would have to be examined in detail."
