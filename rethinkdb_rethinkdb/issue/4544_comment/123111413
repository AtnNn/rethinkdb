      "Ok that makes sense. In that case I like @larkost 's proposal to call them `RqlQueryError`. That seems to capture the idea best so far (unless I'm still missing something about that error class).\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, I think we should reconsider the CompileError vs. RuntimeError distinction at some point. From a user's perspective I think the distinction between compilation and runtime phase isn't clear, and both CompileErrors and logic errors require rewriting the query. But let's keep that for a separate discussion later."
