A feature that may make a nice addition to the driver would be if the `com.rethinkdb.net.Cursor` instance could implement the `Closeable` interface. This would make it easier to use through Java's [try-with-resources](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html) idiom.\n"
