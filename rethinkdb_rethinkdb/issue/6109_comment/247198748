      "<strike>My understanding so far is that it's well documented that change-feeds only store a certain number of changes. Therefor, it's not an error that some were omitted, is it? Honestly, it's generous that the database even includes the number omitted. However, I'd suggest logging it to the debug log (if it doesn't already) and letting people know that's a thing (if it is).</strike>\r\n\r\nAfter talking about it in Slack, I can agree with the  proposition."
