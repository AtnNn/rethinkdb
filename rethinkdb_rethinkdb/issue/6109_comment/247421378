      "This was the behavior that I expected while starting to write tests, so I am generically in favor of it. @danielmewes, would this be a complete change, or would there be an opt-arg allowing users to specifically opt-in to getting the error as a document?\r\n\r\nAnd the second question is: are we planning to just change the clients (relatively easy)? Or is this a sever-side change as well?"
