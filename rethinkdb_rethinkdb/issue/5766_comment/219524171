      "Maybe the admin pod was supposed to run a `rethinkdb proxy` instance. That would have made more sense, but apparently it's not fully configured for actually doing that.\r\n\r\nA RethinkDB proxy doesn't hold any data, so it's ok for it to use ephemeral storage. Running it as a regular server node on such storage is a recipe for disaster though."
