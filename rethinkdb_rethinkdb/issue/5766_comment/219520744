      "That's an odd setup. Where did you get this the Kubernetes setup from?\r\n\r\nI suspect that the admin pod without persistent storage is responsible for your issues. I suspect that when you first created some of the tables, the replicas were placed on the admin pod (RethinkDB tries to evenly distribute replicas across all servers). Unfortunately it looks like that data might now be lost. :-("
