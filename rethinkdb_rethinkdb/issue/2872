        "The preliminary implementation of the ReQL admin API uses a default-constructed `configured_limits_t` everywhere. Maybe we should instead thread through user-specified limits, or use `configured_limits_t::unlimited`. I think the latter is probably better, because (I think) it's more consistent with the behavior of real tables; it's way easier to implement; and we don't want to limit peoples' ability to administer their cluster. But this probably deserves more thought than the ten seconds that I spent thinking about it.\n"
