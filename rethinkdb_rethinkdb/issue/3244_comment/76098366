      "Using `python2` would break in some environments where RethinkDB gets built that have `python` but not `python2`. It would also force users to use Python 2.\r\n\r\nAll our Python scripts that run during the build are compatible with Python 3. This is however not the case for the bundled version of v8. After upgrading v8 (see the `atnnn/v8` branch, currently in review), I'll revisit #3731.\r\n\r\nSee also https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/ and the linked threads "
