      "Ok we need to figure out why something started using so much memory.\r\n\r\nWe've had some reports recently of increased memory usage by RethinkDB under disk I/o contention. Taking a backup might have pushed it into that scenario. We're still investigating this problem though, so it's too early to tell if it's a plausible explanation of this or not.\r\n\r\nAnother thing we're looking into is whether the backup script itself could be using too much memory.\r\n\r\n@bsharpe \r\n* Were you using `rethinkdb dump` (or `rethinkdb export`) for the backup?\r\n* Did you run it on the same server where the OOM error occurred? \r\n* Could a scheduled backup process also have played a role in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5935 ?\r\n* Does your normal query workload include a lot of write operations?"
