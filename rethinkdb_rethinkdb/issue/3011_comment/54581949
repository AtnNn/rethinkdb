      "The (tentative) plan is to deal with #3009 by using a deterministic arithmetic library like MPFR instead of the hardware arithmetic to implement `r.add`, `r.sub`, etc. This way, ReQL arithmetic will remain deterministic. But we don't want to use MPFR for geo operations because it might be slow (and possibly for other reasons as well; I'm not sure what Daniel's full rationale is). So instead, we're marking geo operations non-deterministic."
