      "Right, I think for some geometry operations MPFR might very well work.\r\nOthers (such as `distance()` or `r.circle()`) perform some pretty complex math and I expect that their performance would suffer considerably from using an exact math library. It would also be a lot of work to convert them, I think.\r\n\r\nI slightly prefer `polygon_sub` over `geo_sub` as well by the way."
