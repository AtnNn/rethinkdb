        "@danielmewes, @encryptio -- based on our conversation yesterday I was under the impression that `r.table('test').update{|row| {a: r.geojson(row['a'])}}` (and other similar queries) should work because they're marked \"deterministic on one server\".\r\n\r\nThis is the behavior I'm actually seeing:\r\n```\r\nirb(main):1234:0> r.table('test').update{|row| {a: r.geojson(row['a'])}}.run\r\nRethinkDB::RqlQueryLogicError: Could not prove argument deterministic.  Maybe you want to use the non_atomic flag?\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs that expected?  If so, what's the purpose of the \"deterministic on one server\" distinction?"
