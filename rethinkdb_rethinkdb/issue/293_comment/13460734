      "I agree that completion of table/db names is important. Tab and click completion should work, and if the user types `\"foo` and clicks on `bar`, `\"foo` should be replaced with `\"bar`.\r\n\r\nI also agree that table names should be on top. It won't confuse first time users if formatted right, and is infinitely more useful for regular users.\r\n\r\nEDIT: we can open a separate issue for completion. I'm moving this to 1.4 since the original issue is about bolding the names, and that's making it."
