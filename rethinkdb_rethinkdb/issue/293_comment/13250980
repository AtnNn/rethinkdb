      "Most of the time IDEs offer different mechanisms for code-autocompletion and quick doc reference. Our suggester serves both purposes, so we should think which one is more common: looking up the documentation or just code-autocompletion. Inside an IDE, I'd say code autocompletion. So without any additional data I'd say the same applies to DataExplorer.\r\n\r\nI think having the completion terms up and documentation underneath makes a bit more sense to me."
