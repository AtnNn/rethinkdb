      "Agreed with @al3xandru in that completion is the top priority, so putting them up on top makes sense. Also, I don't think it's that confusing to see a list prefaced with \"List of tables:\" for a first-time user, it's pretty logical to see that.\r\n\r\nI think that clicking + tab completion should both work as per @neumino's suggestion. @coffeemug, what are your thoughts?"
