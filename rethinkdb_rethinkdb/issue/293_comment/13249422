      "The names are already in bold in my branch.\r\nIt should make in next soon.\r\n\r\nMoving the names on the top is not a good idea I think because\r\n- People who are used to the data explorer will knows where the tables'names are, and when it's bol/darker, it's really easy to spot, so it won't provide a really better user experience.\r\n- First time users will read in the description a list of tables then the description of table() which is a little confusing.\r\n\r\nAllowing the user to auto complete the table name by clicking on a name requires a little of work. \r\nWe'll also have to figure out some cases\r\n- Should we filter tables according to what the user wrote? I think it shouldn't, but then what if the user writes `r.db(\"bar` and click on the table \"foo\"?\r\n- Can the user hit tab to auto complete the name?"
