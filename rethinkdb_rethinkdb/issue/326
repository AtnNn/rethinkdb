        "Currently `groupBy` has a number of problems. The first one is that it only supports one reduction. To make things pleasant, it should support multiple:\n\n```\nseq.groupBy(`username`, [r.avg('salary'), r.avg('productivity')])\n```\n\nThe second problem is that it returns things named 'group' and 'reduction'. We should allow people to optionally specify names for attributes.\n\nThe third problem is that our static value sugar (I guess @jdoliner's term stuck) is very limiting in terms of nested objects, and arbitrary expressions (e.g. if I want to say `r.avg(r('salary').add(1)))` or `r.groupBy(r('username').append('a'))` I currently can't). Once we work out a general approach to it, we should incorporate it here.\n"
