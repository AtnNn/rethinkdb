      "I'm in favor for adding such method, not that because it's hard (or ugly) to use an inner query but because people will naturally look for eqJoin/innerJoin/outerJoin to do it, and they will end up doing non efficient queries.\r\n\r\nOne of the problem of using an inner query is that people have to manually coerce to an array, which is not an obvious thing to do."
