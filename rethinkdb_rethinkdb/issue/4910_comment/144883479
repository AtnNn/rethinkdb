      "I can't find a way in which this could happen, unless maybe the `real_table_persistance_interface_t` gets destructed while a mailbox callback is still active (I can't see an obvious mechanism to stop that from happening). That's not super likely though, since it will only get destructed on shutting down the server.\r\n\r\nI'll run the tests a few more times, but I don't think we need to block the release for this (even if this function is run on the wrong thread, it's actually very unlikely to lead to any crashes or incorrect behavior)."
