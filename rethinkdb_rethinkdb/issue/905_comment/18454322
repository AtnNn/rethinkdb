      "Hello @AVVS \r\n\r\nThanks for contributing : )\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been working on a cookbook for RethinkDB too. It should be published sometimes next week I think.\r\n\r\nWe haven't really though if it would become a sub module of our website so people can do pul lrequests, but we'll think about it soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue, since it's not really an issue : )"
