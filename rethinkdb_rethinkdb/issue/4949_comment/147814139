      "Nothing pops out at me as the cause of this bug.\r\n\r\nIf the bug is in the core Raft implementation, then the clock skew is probably unrelated. The core Raft algorithm doesn't ever pass system clock timestamps back and forth across the network. But I wonder if what we're seeing is cross-talk between different Raft instances--perhaps different epochs of the same table. The system clock is used to assign epoch timestamps, so it's possible that the clock skew could affect that somehow. But that theory is a stretch.\r\n\r\nThe output of `r.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"_debug_table_status\")` might point to the cause. @VeXocide, are you working on reproducing it locally?"
