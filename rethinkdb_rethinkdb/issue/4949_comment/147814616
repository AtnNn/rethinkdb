      "@timmaxw I've just uploaded the tarball of the data dir to you guys. Can't run `r.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"_debug_table_status\")` since the bug crashes the server on all subsequent runs unfortunately. \r\n\r\nIt did occur to me (looking at the code indicated in the backtrace) that the time skew related to the other reported crash [here](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4931) is likely only related to that issue and not this one. This seems to be a duplicate index somehow which wouldn't include time. "
