      "Yes. This very well could be an issue with the specific build of Chrome\r\nthat I'm using (64-bit linux) with my combination of extensions and\r\nsettings. I recently turned on the new chrome feature that sends text area\r\ninput to Google for spell checking. That actually could be the source of\r\nthe issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Fri, Mar 29, 2013 at 12:32 PM, Michel <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hum, I really can't reproduce this issue.
