      "@danielmewes Thanks! I have two follow-up questions: \r\n\r\n1. If I increase the data replication factor from 1 to 2 (i.e. the primary plus one copy), will that double the RAM needed for metadata?\r\n2. If there's not enough RAM for a RethinkDB process, what happens? Does the operating system start swapping RAM out to disk (slowing everything down)?"
