      "@ttmc \r\n1. Yes\r\n2. Yes. Going into swap is usually pretty bad for RethinkDB, and RethinkDB servers that have gone into swap often become so slow that other nodes in the cluster consider them unavailable and terminate the connection to them. I recommend adjusting RethinkDB's cache size conservatively to avoid this scenario. RethinkDB will still make use of additional RAM through the operating system's block cache (though less efficiently than when it can keep data in its own cache)."
