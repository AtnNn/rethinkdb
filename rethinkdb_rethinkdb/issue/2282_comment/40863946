      "Nevermind, the driver wasn't passing the arguments when overriding `to_json`, which makes ActiveSupport thinks that `to_json` wasn't called from `JSON.dump()` (otherwise it would have a JSON::State argument), and so it routes the routine to its own dump engine, which uses `as_json`, hence the problem. PR https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/2284 fixes that."
