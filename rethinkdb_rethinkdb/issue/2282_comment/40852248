      "@nviennot -- I was under the impression that Ruby only ran one thread at a time, and that they ran cooperatively (i.e. a new thread will run when the current thread blocks, but the current thread won't be randomly swapped out in the middle of a chunk of code).  Is that accurate?\r\n\r\nIf that is accurate, then that code looks fine because the `JSON.load` shouldn't block (we only call it on strings), which means we'll reset the `create_id` before another thread runs.\r\n\r\nIf that isn't accurate, I think there are other parts of our code which are probably broken too, and we should look into that.  (Actually, how are you supposed to use `create_id` in this case?)"
