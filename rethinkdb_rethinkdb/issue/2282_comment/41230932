      "Thanks @nviennot .  I opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2296 to track the JRuby issue.\r\n\r\nOn the topic of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/ruby/lib/shim.rb#L67-L83 , do you know the \"right\" way to temporarily specify a different JSON serialization for a class?  (It might just be that we'll have to have an initial step where we go through the query object and replace `Time` objects with other objects, but that would be unfortunate.)"
