        "I can reproduce this reliably on 1.4.2 on OS X.\r\n\r\n1. Start `rethinkdb` (make sure you've deleted the `rethinkdb_data` directory)\r\n2. Run the following import command: `rethinkdb import -j localhost:29015 --input-file test.csv  --table test.bar`\r\n\r\nThe file `test.csv` is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nid,a,b\r\n1,2,3\r\n4,5,6\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is still a bug in next or on linux. I can't reproduce this by inserting things -- this bug seems to be caused purely by running the import command. (I know we'll rewrite the command, but it shouldn't put the server in this state anyway -- we need to investigate this)"
