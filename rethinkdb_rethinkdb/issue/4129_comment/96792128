      "Hi @digi604,\r\n\r\nYou're correct; `.filter.update` isn't atomic, but `.update` by itself is.  We're planning to change that since other people have found it confusing as well (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3992).  Closing as a duplicate of the proposal in #3992.  Sorry you ran into this!"
