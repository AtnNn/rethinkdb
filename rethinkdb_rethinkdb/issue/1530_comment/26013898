      "Just to be clear even though I opened this issue I'm fairly opposed to it. I think we have a unified method of accessing indexes right now that works quite well and I'd need to be convinced that we could change this in a way that kept all of the commands unified so any proposal would need to work for all of the following commands:\r\n\r\n- `get_all`\r\n- `between`\r\n- `order_by`\r\n- `eq_join`\r\n\r\n"
