      "The most helpful thing would be to distill the failing test to the smallest reproducible case, and the include that here, or if that is not practical [email it to me](mailto://kalr@rethinkdb.com). Unless you know you are using a StringIO object (my guess is that `nose` is doing that for you), then tell us how you are using that.\r\n\r\nI can't promise that this will be high-priority, but with a straightforward test case in front of one of us it might well be an easy fix."
