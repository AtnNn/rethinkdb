      "It was about what I guessed: `nose` is being clever and using `StringIO` as a replacement for `sys.stdout` (I would have gone with a `NamedTemporaryFile`) and this does not have an `encoding` property. So the driver is tripping over that when trying to output. A fix for this is in db00729f.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes: should I cherry-pick this to `v2.1.x`?"
