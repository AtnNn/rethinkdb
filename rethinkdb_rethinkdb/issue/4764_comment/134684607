      "From the look of this it is because you are trying to use [`nose`](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) as a replacement to the built-in `unittest` and that is trying to be clever at one point and use a StringIO object where we don't support that.\r\n\r\nProbably the fundamental problem here is that we don't use `unitest` as our basic testing harness. It is used in some Python tests, but that is more for my convenience than anything else (remember, we have a number of languages to test). Rather you should be using our two testing harnesses to run our tests:\r\n- `./test/run` this currently runs our server unitests, and a number of \"scenario\" tests that do different things with the server\r\n- `./test/rql_test/test-runner` runs our client driver tests (we call them \"polyglot\" and \"connection\" tests)\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that I have mid-term plans to merge these two systems in #3442, at which time there will only be one test harness.\r\n\r\nOn the assumption that this is the actual problem, I am going to close this. Please comment if this is a bad assumption."
