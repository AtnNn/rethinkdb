      "@RubenKelevra I was actually asking for the log file so we can try to reproduce the issue. The \"logs\" page in the web UI actually works by internally parsing the lines from the log file. So I'm hoping that we could reproduce and debug the problem with your log files (that is assuming there is something particular about the log that's triggering this error)."
