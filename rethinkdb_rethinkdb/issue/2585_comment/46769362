      "Thanks for opening an issue.\r\n\r\nYou said in the email thread that you profiled the driver and saw that almost all of the time was spent waiting on the server, right?  Just to double-check, are you sure that you aren't counting serialization time as server time rather than client time?  We've had problems before with third-party drivers taking a long time to serialize large protobufs.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes, do you know what might be causing this?"
