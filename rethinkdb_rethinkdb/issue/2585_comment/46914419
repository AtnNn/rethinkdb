      "@jjonescs As a work-around, you can try using `r.json()` until the issue is fixed.\r\nI'm not sure about the Go syntax, but basically you would have to convert the document to a JSON string first, then give it as an argument to `r.json()` like this:\r\n```go\r\nresp, err := r.Table(\"games\").Insert(r.Json(gameJsonString)).RunWrite(conn)\r\n```"
