      "I feel like this issue is too large.  `.orderby(index:'id').between(index:'id')` and `.between(index:'id').orderby(index:'id')` both working is already happening with min/max changefeeds because I had to correct the type system problems that were causing it in the first place, so we should drop that from the scope.  I'm going to open new issues for improving the error message and thinking about what we can do with multiple different indexes."
