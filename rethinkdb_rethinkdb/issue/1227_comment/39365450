      "@mlucy unfortunately that won't work for us. The index used in the `get_all()` will never be the same as the index(es) used in the `order_by()`. Seeing as the key used for the `get_all()` is always the same, it wouldn't make sense to also sort by that key.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what we're trying to do:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nr.table('contacts').get_all('bd8ba1bc-102c-4ba3-a1b8-1af65efc9aba', { index: 'organization_id' })\r\n .order_by({ index: 'created_at' })\r\n .limit(25)\r\n .run(conn)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the `order_by()` key could be many options: `created_at`, `first_name`, `last_name`, etc."
