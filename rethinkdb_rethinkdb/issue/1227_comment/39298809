      "Sorry you ran into this! There hasn't been a timeline defined thus far, but let's see if we can get this on the roadmap. @mlucy -- how difficult would this be to do? Is this a few days of work or a few weeks?\r\n\r\nAs far as the workaround, how many documents does `get_all` typically return for you? (basically, what's the output of chaining `.count()` after `get_all`?) Is the performance bearable if you do an unindexed `order_by` for now, while we get this scheduled?"
