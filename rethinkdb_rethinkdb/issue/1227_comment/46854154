      "So, the following query returns an error but shouldn't:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('foo').orderBy({ index: 'id' }).between(1, 5, { index: 'id' })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following query does not return an error and works as expected:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('foo').between(1, 5, {index: 'id'}).orderBy({index: 'id'})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following query returns an error with an error message that could be improved:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('foo').orderBy('id').between(1, 5, { index: 'id' })\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the first step would be fixing these inconsistencies. The second step would be to figure out how we can help users when the fields are different. Is there *anything* we can do? It might be as simple as writing a cookbook entry, or as complex as a 2d index feature, or something in between."
