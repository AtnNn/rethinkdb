      "> As far as the workaround, how many documents does get_all typically return for you?\r\n\r\nIt varies. Can be as little as a couple hundred, or as many as several hundred thousands. It simply depends on the criteria. (The issue in question is the retrieval of 'contact' documents that are scoped by organization, and each organization has varying amounts of contacts).\r\n\r\n> Is the performance bearable if you do an unindexed order_by for now, while we get this scheduled?\r\n\r\nPerformance isn't an issue if I use `limit()` (which would always be the case, as we will need to use pagination or cursor loading)."
