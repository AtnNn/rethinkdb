      "This fix includes two changes: `.d` files built from a different directory are now ignored, and a new `make deps` target rebuilds the `.d` files.\r\n\r\n@larkost suggested using absolute paths everywhere as another solution. If this issue or a related issue becomes serious enough, we should consider it.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nDependencies are not correctly tracked when building from a different directory. To avoid this issue, always build from the same directory. If you run into this issue, use `make deps` to quickly rebuild all the `.d` files."
