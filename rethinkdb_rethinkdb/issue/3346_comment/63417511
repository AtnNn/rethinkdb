      "How do I retrieve the server version?\r\nI need to know the server version so that I can apply a `coerce_to('array')` as a workaround on the buggy `between()` to allow `distinct()` to work.\r\nCan we have something similar to http://redis.io/commands/info ? but maybe with some sort of fake table or something, whatever makes sense for you?"
