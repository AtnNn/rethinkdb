      "You'll be able to get the server version from a \"pseudo table\" starting with RethinkDB 1.16 (it will be in `r.db('rethinkdb').table('server_status')`).\r\nRight now it's not available through ReQL unfortunately.\r\n\r\nAs long as the `between`/`get_all` are run on a multi-index, always adding the `coerce_to('array')` is probably fine. `distinct()` is going to do the same thing internally anyway in those cases."
