      "Hmm we might have to determine that on the server and then return some special value in `ajax/me`.\r\nThe current state is that `<Unknown>` is shown under \"Connected to\", but the rest of the status bar (at least Servers */* connected and Tables */* ready) are broken (= remain empty) when opening the web UI on a proxy.\r\nI think this is going to be a relatively rare use case, so I wouldn't worry about this for 1.16.0."
