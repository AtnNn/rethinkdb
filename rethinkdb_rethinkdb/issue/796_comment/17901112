      "Trying to reproduce this under simpler conditions, and it appears this can happen with only one server in the cluster.  At the moment, it looks like a query that was sharded for the old sharding scheme is being passed to the newly sharded master_access_t.  Probably just a race condition concerning interruptors, will keep investigating."
