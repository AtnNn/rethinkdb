      "Ok, this appears to be a poorly implemented `rdb_w_get_region_visitor` for `rdb_protocol_t::batched_replaces_t`, along with an rassert checking it.  Really, this shouldn't cause any issues in release mode, though we should have a correct visitor for get_region for debugging and runtime-checks.  This would indicate that batched writes will not work on a sharded table in debug mode."
