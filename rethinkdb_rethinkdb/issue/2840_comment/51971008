      "It also worked for me on magneto with a release build. However I can see the server permanently using more than 15 GB of memory during the test, even though the cache size is just 1 GB.\r\nThis is the case with both v1.13.3 and next.\r\n\r\nWill try to profile it, since that's way too much memory."
