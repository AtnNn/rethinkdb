        "I thought we had changed this a long time ago, but currently the Python driver has the following behavior:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [3]: r.table('configs').run()\r\nOut[3]: <rethinkdb.net.DefaultCursor at 0x7ff4d535ec50>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's not very helpful behavior for interactive use.  I think we want to make the Python driver behave more like the Ruby driver here, which does this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nirb(main):017:0> r.table('configs').run\r\n#<RethinkDB::Cursor:11519140 (enumerable): r.table(\"configs\")\r\n[{\"InstanceType\"=>\"t2.micro\",\r\n  \"NumServers\"=>1,\r\n  \"Version\"=>\"7a0af72a-6720-4695-a08b-4cf1eaa18a45\",\r\n  \"id\"=>\"mlucy\"}]>\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Basically, when it prints a cursor it prints the first 10 elements of the cursor or however many elements the server has sent us, whichever is fewer.  If the cursor isn't exhausted, it prints a `...` to indicate that there's more in it.)\r\n\r\nThis is *drastically* nicer for interactive use than having to put `list(...)` around the cursor, especially if there's a lot of rows in the table and you just want to quickly see what it looks like rather than actually loading the whole thing into an array.\r\n\r\nPutting this into 2.3 because @encryptio and I have actually been finding it really annoying when playing around in Python, but I wouldn't object too strongly if we bumped this to subsequent."
