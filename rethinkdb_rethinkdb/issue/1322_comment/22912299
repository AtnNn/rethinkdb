      "The cause is pretty clear:  we aren't wrapping our syscalls in the driver with code that handles EINTR and retries the call.\r\n\r\nThis *must* be done!  We can't fix this by seeing which specific system call is producing EINTR in some specific case.  We need to fix every syscall in the driver that might return EINTR.  It is unlikely that it is just the one."
