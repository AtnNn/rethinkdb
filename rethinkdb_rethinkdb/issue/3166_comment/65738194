      "One annoying thing about `auto` is that then we need another interface to show the user what cache size was actually picked. So probably we would have an immutable `cache_size_mb` in `server_status` that's always a real number, and a mutable `cache_size_mb` in `server_config` that's sometimes a real number and sometimes `\"auto\"`."
