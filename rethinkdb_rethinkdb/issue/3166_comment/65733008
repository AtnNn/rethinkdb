      "Something that came up during review, this could slightly break existing behavior.  Currently, if a user never specifies `--cache-size`, every time they start their server, the current cache size will be re-evaluated based on available memory.  This means that if a user frees up RAM or upgrades their machine, the server should continue working as expected.\r\n\r\nNow, with storing `--cache-size` in the configuration, whatever default cache size is used when the server is created will now stay constant across restarts.  This could even result in some strange cases in virtualized environments (i.e. a user uses `rethinkdb create` on a low-memory instance and later runs the server on a high-memory instance).\r\n\r\nThat said, I think this behavior is acceptable as long as we make it exceedingly easy to notice this and update the cache size of any server.  This means web UI support and very helpful notification messages."
