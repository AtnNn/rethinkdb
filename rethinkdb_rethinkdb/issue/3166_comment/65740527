      "@Tryneus I'm not sure about making the \"cache size bigger than available memory\" an error. In the past our function to get the available memory has been unreliable, so I would be opposed to failing based on it.\r\n\r\n@timmaxw Yeah, we would have to bring the size field back to `server_status`. Sorry for not thinking of this whole problem earlier.\r\n\r\nHaving a message like the one you mention @Tryneus on startup would be ok, but I think having an `\"auto\"` setting would be much nicer.\r\n\r\nIf we do \"auto\", we should probably still print a `notice` message on startup similar to the one you suggested whenever the cache size is actually automatically determined . Otherwise we can keep it at the `info` \"Using cache size of ... MB\" one."
