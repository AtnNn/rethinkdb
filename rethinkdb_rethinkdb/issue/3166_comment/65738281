      "@danielmewes, I think if we log a notice at startup, when we log the initial cache size, that may be enough.  We already log a warning if the initial cache size is greater than available memory, though I think we should upgrade that to an error.\r\n\r\nI think it should look something like `info: Using cache size of 128 MB, this can be changed through the HTTP interface or by writing to the 'rethinkdb.server_config' table.`\r\n\r\nAnd live updates to the cache size should result in `info: Using cache size of 128 MB`"
