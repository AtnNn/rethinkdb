      "Another option might be to have an `\"auto\"` setting for the cache size, which restores the old behavior of dynamically determining it at every restart.\r\nIt would be the default until you set an explicit cache size at least once.\r\nAfter that, you could return to `\"auto\"` by either writing that string to the `server_config` table or by passing `--cache-size auto` on the command line."
