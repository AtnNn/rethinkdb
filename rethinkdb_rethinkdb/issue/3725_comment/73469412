      "Presumably the same is true for `vt.changes(squash=1)` (where the value of `squash` is a number, not a bool).\r\n\r\nFWIW, I remember discussing this and we decided to to ignore values of `squash` that don't apply instead of erroring, but now I'm not sure if that was a good decision. We should probably discuss what we want to happen a bit; I could see both points of view and am not sure what's best."
