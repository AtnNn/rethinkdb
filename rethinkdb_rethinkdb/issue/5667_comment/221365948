      "@thomasmodeneis The driver doesn't handle reconnects at all. You'll need to catch the exception and call `reconnect` in your application code.\r\nAlternatively you can check out rethinkdbdash https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash which is mostly compatible to the official JavaScript driver, but comes with a connection pool and automatic reconnects."
