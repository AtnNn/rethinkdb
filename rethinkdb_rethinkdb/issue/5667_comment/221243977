      "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have rethinkdb 2.3.1 and I just ran into something similar to this that the ticket is reporting, \r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: uncaughtException: read ECONNRESET date=Tue May 24 2016 01:48:48 GMT+0200 (CEST), pid=76930, uid=501, gid=20, cwd=/opt/test123, execPath=/usr/local/bin/node, version=v5.6.0, argv=[/usr/local/bin/node, /opt/test123/app/server], rss=90857472, heapTotal=66259744, heapUsed=49247000, loadavg=[1.591796875, 1.76025390625, 1.99755859375], uptime=3162541, trace=[column=11, file=util.js, function=exports._errnoException, line=856, method=_errnoException, native=false, column=26, file=net.js, function=TCP.onread, line=546, method=onread, native=false], stack=[Error: read ECONNRESET,     at exports._errnoException (util.js:856:11),     at TCP.onread (net.js:546:26)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could not find anything in the documentation referring to retries when the connection with the database fails with such error, this is causing my entire app to be taken down and so I would really appreciate if someone could give me a hint for the retry strategy with this driver. \r\nThank you."
