      "Alright, after looking at this today, as far as I can tell the @_closeAsap stuff isn't hurting anything. If we just launch a `STOP` immediately upon `cursor.close()`, we should be ok. Any outstanding `CONTINUE` queries will get their callbacks run, and everything should be ok. From what I can tell, the `@_cbQueue` is specifically for this issue where multiple queries are out at once for the same token.\r\n\r\n@neumino thoughts?"
