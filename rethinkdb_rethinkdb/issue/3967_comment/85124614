      "Good catch.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify: This used to work well enough since every request to a feed would time out after 0.5s (though it was still not great). With 2.0 changefeeds don't time out quickly anymore, so this script can lock for a long time.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus I think you had changed the server such that STOP queries are always processed hadn't you? Do you know if the Python and Ruby drivers handle this correctly?\r\n\r\nAssigning @deontologician for the JS driver fix."
