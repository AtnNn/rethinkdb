      "@deontologician -- It's slightly a bit more tricky.\r\n\r\nYou can have the cursor with a pending `CONTINUE` query meaning that the object `outstandingCallbacks[token]` will have a `cb` field mapping to a function.\r\n\r\nIf you directly send `STOP`, you need to save the callback somewhere (you can't just overwrite `cb`, so you probably want to add a new field like `endCb`).\r\nThen you will get twice `SUCCESS_SEQUENCE` (for the same token) with an empty response, so you have to make sure that it doesn't break the driver."
