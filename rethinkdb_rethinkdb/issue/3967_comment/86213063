      "The `cb` field for queries that return `SUCCESS_PARTIAL` is only called when the cursor is first created. After that, the connection only calls _addResponse when a new response comes in for the token.\r\n\r\nInternally, the cursor keeps track of how many queries are outstanding for that token and increments or decrements `_outstandingRequests` as necessary. The connection only deletes the cursor if `_endFlag` is set and `cursor._outstandingRequests` is 0.\r\n\r\nI need to make sure that tokens that come in after the cursor is removed won't disrupt anything, but in my ad-hoc tests this seems to be working"
