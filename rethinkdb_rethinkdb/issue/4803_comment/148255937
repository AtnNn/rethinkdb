      "> Err actually it's because the server return a ReqlCompileError now instead of a ReqlRuntimeError and that the driver doesn't build a backtrace for ReqlCompileError.\r\n\r\nAh that explains why it changed in 2.1.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason for why we don't attach backtraces to ReqlCompileErrors or is that just an oversight?
