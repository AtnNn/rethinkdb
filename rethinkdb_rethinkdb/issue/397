        "We already implement static value sugar for `filter`. We also need it for `update` and `replace`.\n\n```\nt.update(datum) <=> t.update(lambda row: row.merge(datum))\nt.replace(datum) <=> t.replace(lambda row: datum.merge({ 'id': row['id']}))\n```\n\nNote that in the case above for `replace` if `datum` contains an id that's different from the id of the row, we should error (I didn't want to write that in the expression because it's a pain).\n\nAlso, please don't close the issue, just write here when it's done and I'll add everything to the test suite.\n\nAssigned to @mlucy.\n"
