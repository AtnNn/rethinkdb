        "ack_expectations[uuid] needs an object instead of a number.\n\nack_expectations[uuid] used to need a number before commit \n7b52a05(\"Fix log, refactorget_durability, fix switch primary\"), \nwhich changed it to accept a object. However that commit forgot\nto change it on http_admin.py side, thus introduced following error\nwhile running regress-852 test:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"$RETHINKDBtest/regression/issue_852.py\", line 41, in <module>\n    affinities = {dc: 1}, ack_expectations = {dc: 2})\n  File \"$RETHINKDB/test/common/http_admin.py\", line 562, in add_namespace\n    info = self.do_query(\"POST\", \"/ajax/semilattice/%s_namespaces/new\" % protocol, data_to_post)\n  File \"$RETHINKDB/test/common/http_admin.py\", line 349, in do_query\n    return self.do_query_specific(host, http_port, method, route, payload)\n  File \"$RETHINKDB/test/common/http_admin.py\", line 361, in do_query_specific\n    return json.loads(self.do_query_specific_plaintext(host, http_port, method, route, payload, headers))\n  File \"$RETHINKDB/test/common/http_admin.py\", line 374, in do_query_specific_plaintext\n    raise BadServerResponse(response.status, response.reason)\nhttp_admin.BadServerResponse: Server returned error code: 400 Bad Request\n```\n\nAnd you can see following error from rethinkdb log:\n\n```\ninfo: HTTP request throw a schema_mismatch_exc_t with what = Expected object instead got: 2\n```\n\nThis patch does make the \"400 Bad Request\" error dispear, but the\ntestcase still failed due to rethinkdb crash.\n\nSigned-off-by: Liu Aleaxander Aleaxander@gmail.com\n"
