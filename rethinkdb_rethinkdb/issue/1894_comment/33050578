      "Hum, that's something I noticed when comparing backtraces between drivers.\r\n\r\nEvery time we get a function, we should look for an implicit_var and then print or not `function(...)`.\r\n\r\nI did a quick hack in rethinkdbdash -- https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash/blob/master/lib/error.js#L434\r\nWe can probably do the same or properly recurse in the tree."
