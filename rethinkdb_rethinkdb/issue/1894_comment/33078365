      "That's definitely possible but the way I currently make things out is that I have a base query from the user or an entire table. After that I also apply various filters on each field, a pluck for the fields the user wants and an order by according to a request by the user. I could just as well concatenate their string representation to one big query and save that. It's definitely possible.\r\n\r\nIt is however rather more convenient to be able to just use the toString on the query object and use that. I can wait for the next version with this feature for now."
