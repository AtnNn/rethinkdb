        "I'm seeing the following test failures on next, consistently, even from 9702489; since it was broken on next before I merged gchpaco_2654, I felt okay about pushing those.  Oddly, @mlucy does not experience these same failures on 9702489.\n\n```\nnewton :: rethinkdb/test/rql_test \8249next\8250 \187 ./test-runner --clean connections/connection.js
