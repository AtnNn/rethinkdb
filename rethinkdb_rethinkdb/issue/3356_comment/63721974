      "Hi @chanon , thank you for opening an issue about your use case.\r\n\r\nThe feature you're requesting is mostly equivalent to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/809 , with the one addition that in your case you would be using the same index twice rather than two (or more) different ones.\r\n\r\nIt is technically difficult to really optimize this sort of operation with a regular index, though there are a few things that we can do to make such an operation more efficient.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind, I would like to close this issue in favor of #809 so we don't have two issues about the same underlying feature."
