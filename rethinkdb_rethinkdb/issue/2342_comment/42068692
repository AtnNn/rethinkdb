      "One more thing to limit confusion instead of sending just 1 document down the pipeline at a time there should be concurrent batches moving though the pipeline. I am pretty sure a batch should block another batch from over taking it or at least over taking it before being sent to the user. what i mean by this is.\r\n\r\nr.table().orderBy().filter().filter().filter()\r\n\r\n3 batches or more can be run at once if for some reason the 1st batch is super slow going though the filters other batches can go to the last one and wait till the first batch gets sent to the user. then the other ones can get set."
