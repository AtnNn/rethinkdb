      ">I was talking about intra-cluster streaming. As far as the client protocol goes, streaming there would be nice too, but it would require the client driver to spawn its own threads in languages that aren't Javascript, or could require a more advanced interface for the client driver. (Or we could not do that, and stuff could sit in the network buffer.)\r\n\r\nthat is true but many lanauges have sort of instant timeout these days so they can do a level of non blocking that would allow for some sort of streaming as long as its not processing something it got from before. when i said client i sould have said nodes and client streaming in the way of control messages would be killer but i feel like that is var away."
