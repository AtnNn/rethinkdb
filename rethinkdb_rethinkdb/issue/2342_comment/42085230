      "> Prefetching improves how long it takes for a single client to retrieve the full result, which one could call \"latency\" (in contrast to having multiple clients). It does not improve how long it takes until the first result is received.\r\n\r\nPrefetching reduces the problem of latency slowing things down thanks to communication delays within the cluster, because there's less time wasted waiting for responses.  If the slow end is on the parser- or client-side, it could eliminate the problem, but if it's on the store side, it could have a little to negligible improvement.\r\n\r\n(@wojons: The parser means the machine talking to the client, which also tends to do a lot of ReQL query evaluation, and it could be slow when evaluating a large query.)"
