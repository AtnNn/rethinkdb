      "Hi @wojons, thanks for the nice issue report.\r\n\r\nI think the crux of this is that the cluster-internal batching should also request the next batch while it is still processing the current one.\r\n@mlucy We are not already doing that, are we?\r\n\r\nFor making the batch configurable by the user, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/248 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2185"
