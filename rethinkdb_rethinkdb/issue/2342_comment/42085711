      "@srh: It's not just about communication delays. Let's say you run `r.table().delete()`. \r\nI believe what happens now is that the parser will load a batch of documents from the shards, and then issues a series of deletions back to the shards (@mlucy: please correct me if I'm wrong).\r\nSo for some period, the shards will only be reading, followed by a period where they are only writing. Reading and writing data utilizes non-identical subsets of resources (it might be more extreme in other examples). If both were happening in parallel, the overall speed of the query might improve. And that's what prefetching would do."
