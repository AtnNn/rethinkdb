      "@wojons: if we implemented pipelining within the cluster like that, it wouldn't be a flag, it would be the default.\r\n\r\n> anyway; someone just has to sit down and change all the places where we get batches to make them prefetch.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to not suck we would just stream things instead of requesting batches back and forth like that.  The parser end would only send traffic-control messages back.  (Prefetching batches is just a dumb form of traffic control messages, you can obviously do that better.)  (Also, the problem with prefetching is that you still have to wait for the previous batch before fetching the next batch.)"
