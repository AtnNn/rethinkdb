      "What do you guys mean when you talk of streaming? Obviously we wouldn't want to send one message per document. The overhead would be horrible.\r\n\r\nI think there's also some confusion about what latency means.\r\nPrefetching improves how long it takes for a single client to retrieve the full result, which one could call \"latency\" (in contrast to having multiple clients). It does not improve how long it takes until the first result is received."
