      "so in my current example the reason this is a problem is because of how long my pipeline is. if there were lots of batches ready and waiting at the end this would not really be a problem. Now control messages is all cool and advance but i have a feeling that if the style moved to that it will be a while before its done and this issue wll start be coming an issue as more and more people start using it. at least with pre fetching pre batching what ever we want to call it it gives something workable until serval versions from now its fixed full. I feel like pre fetching will be able to make it into 1.14 if it wanted to but streaming would not make it til 2.x"
