      "> streaming. server starts getting batches and sending them to the client as fast as i can, the client then sends messages to tell the server to speed up or slow down.\r\n\r\nI was talking about intra-cluster streaming.  As far as the client protocol goes, streaming there would be _nice_ too, but it would require the client driver to spawn its own threads in languages that aren't Javascript, or could require a more advanced interface for the client driver.  (Or we could not do that, and stuff could sit in the network buffer.)"
