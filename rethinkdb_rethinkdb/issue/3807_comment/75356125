      "~~Uh, on debugging, it looks like the error is https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/net.coffee#L929 - the `once` listener gets called for the first error, *and then the `on` listener never gets called*. Maybe this was a change in how `once` event listeners work between 0.10 and 0.11?~~\r\n\r\nDisregard that, both listeners appear to fire."
