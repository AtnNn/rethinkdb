      "It turns out that #3516 is primarily due to our use of `mprotect` on coroutine stacks.\r\n\r\nA patch that avoids hitting a limit on the number of mapped virtual memory areas is now in code review 3614. Once that is in, early tests indicate that we can bump the jemalloc versions without hitting #3516 again.\r\n"
