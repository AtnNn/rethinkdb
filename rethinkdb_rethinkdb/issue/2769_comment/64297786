      "@wojons Thank you for the clarification.\r\n\r\nYou wrote above that the path was commented out. If we displayed an issue whenever RethinkDB uses the default path, I think that would be very confusing to all the users who use a default path intentionally.\r\n\r\nThe weird thing here is that it used `/tmp/rethinkdb_data` as its data directory. The init script should use a directory in `/var/lib/rethinkdb` as the default.\r\nSo I guess you were starting `rethinkdb` in a different way (not through the init system)?\r\n\r\nI'm not exactly sure how we can catch such mistakes. Hard-coding a check for `/tmp` and displaying an issue then is an option. It by no means guarantees that the data actually ends up where the user intends it to, but it will catch some cases at least.\r\n\r\nRather low priority though..."
