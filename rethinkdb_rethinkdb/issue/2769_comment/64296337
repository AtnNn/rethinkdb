      "@wojons\r\n>  i think if someone data will be deleted on server restasrt but not rethinkdb process restart there should be a little alert message on the web admin just like when its time to upgrade version of rethinkdb but that the data will vanish\r\n\r\nCan you explain this a bit more? Why would the data be deleted on server restart in the first place?"
