      "@danielmewes If you look in the dump i provided you will see that the data was mounted to /tmp/rethinkdb/data so when the server gets retarted and a few other condations that data gets deleted. That occured because when rethinkdb started there was an issue with the path i provided in the config file so it defaulted else where. But there was no message in the dashboard that it switched to a default due to an error in the path. "
