        "Now that #2563 is done (except the part now described by this issue), we're supposed to be able to support cluster version upgrades in the data file format: you can migrate to a new version of RethinkDB by shutting down the whole cluster and starting up a new cluster with a new version of RethinkDB.\r\n\r\nThat eliminates 99% of developer pain in the upgrade process.  This issue is for supporting live upgrades *without* bringing down all the nodes.  Instead, to upgrade node-by-node and then, when it's ready, snap the cluster into \"new version\" state.\r\n\r\nWe would no longer have the `cluster_version_t::CLUSTER` value (which is a synonym for `cluster_version_t::LATEST`).\r\n\r\nThis is hard to do, it probably requires fresh thinking every time there's a new interesting feature that changes channels of communication, and we should not do this now or in the near future."
