      "I don't think we need to have anything specific here we just need to change the way we report type errors in general. I think the correct message here would be:\r\n\r\n\"`insert` expects an OBJECT or SEQUENCE but found `1` (NUMBER) instead\"\r\n\r\nThis references all of the acceptable types. Mentions which function has received an argument of incorrect type and tells you what the errant value was along with its type rather than just telling you the incorrect type."
