      "Alright, so this is more complicated than I thought.  Our type hierarchy is really sort of absurd.\r\n\r\nI think that rather than trying to do this the right way we should just write a custom error message every time we run across an example where the common error-checking code produces a confusing one.  There probably won't be too many, and they shouldn't take more than a few minutes each."
