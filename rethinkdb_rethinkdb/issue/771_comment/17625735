      "I really dislike the idea of special casing `insert` type errors because that happens to be one that someone hit and having the long term plan be to special case type errors as people hit them. I feel like the majority of the time when people get a bad error message they don't go and file bug about making it better they normally just carry on having a bad experience assuming that they're doing something stupid. I'd really like to see this done correctly so people get consistent error messages for things like this.\r\n\r\nCan you explain what makes our type hierarchy so absurd that this hard?"
