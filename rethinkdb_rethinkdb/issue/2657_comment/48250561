      "> displaying something in the web UI is difficult (since nodes with incompatible versions don't even get to the stage where they are connected to the cluster)\r\n\r\nThe web UI already does show when an instance is disconnected, it shows a \"Server Down\" error and offers to \"Permanently remove\" it.\r\n\r\nIf the disconnected instance is now running a different RethinkDB version, a relevant message could be displayed instead of \"Server Down\", and instead of (or next to) \"Permanently remove\" there could be a recommendation about upgrading either the current instance, or the disconnected one."
