      "Improved error messages are in CR 1748,\r\nminus the `Received invalid clustering header` issue that I couldn't reproduce anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso I didn't do anything about presenting it in the web UI. @neumino: Is it possible to show something in the UI when we encounter an unresolvable protocol version? Right now it just does a `logWRN()` to write a message to the log."
