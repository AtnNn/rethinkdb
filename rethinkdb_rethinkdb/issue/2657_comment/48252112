      "> the other nodes in the cluster have no way of knowing that a given machine is running a wrong version\r\n\r\nI don't mind dropping this discussion, but I think we misunderstand each other. When trying to reconnect to a disconnected machine, version numbers will be exchanged and both machines will know if there is a version mismatch. Are you saying that the server cannot hold on to this information and display it to the user?"
