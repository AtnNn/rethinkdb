      "Improved error messages have been merged into v1.13.x and next.\r\nSee https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/commit/906d9caa286d069210057ccb6ee97316ee75cfa7 for details.\r\n\r\nI also talked to @neumino and we think that displaying something in the web UI is difficult (since nodes with incompatible versions don't even get to the stage where they are connected to the cluster). \r\n\r\nHowever we should add a way for the node that's trying to connect to find out *why* its connection was rejected, e.g. by sending back an error message. That requires a change to the cluster protocol."
