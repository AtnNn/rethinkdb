      "> However we should add a way for the node that's trying to connect to find out why its connection was rejected, e.g. by sending back an error message. That requires a change to the cluster protocol.\r\n\r\nWe should probably do that before we close this issue. It's hard to debug this kind of a problem in practice because the user would have to look at the logs for various machines in the cluster instead of the logs of the offending node (which is hard).\r\n\r\n> If the disconnected instance is now running a different RethinkDB version, a relevant message could be displayed instead of \"Server Down\", and instead of (or next to) \"Permanently remove\" there could be a recommendation about upgrading either the current instance, or the disconnected one.\r\n\r\nI think we shouldn't do this for now because some of the fundamental assumptions might change with the new cluster management API."
