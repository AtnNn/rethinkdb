      "We had a proposal for extending json with additional types which will eventually be implemented. The question then, is which python types would pickle, which ones would be coerced to native rethinkdb types, etc.\r\n\r\nI'm moving to post-protobuf-improvements, let's discuss this when 1.4 is out. (I think doing something about this after 1.4 is a bit premature, but it'll become more clear then)."
