        "With the risk of coming across as an arrogant ass, I've been peeking at the commit history of RethinkDB and find it to be somewhat messy in places. I think some basic guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and some occasional tough love by the maintainers before merging PRs would be beneficial for all parties. I don't think asking contributors to rebase their branches and clean up their commit messages before a PR is accepted is too much to ask.\n\nFor people contributing to the project, guidelines helps reduce confusion about the expectations on building a successful PR. For maintainers, nice commit messages and branches helps with code review. Lastly, for an outsider like me, a pretty commit history helps me build confidence in the maturity and stability of the project as a whole.\n\nSome examples from the last few months:\n\n1) Commit messages without any real content: _\"merged\"_, _\"bugfixes\"_, etc.\n2) Redundant merges (many instances of _\"Merge branch 'next' of github.com:rethinkdb/rethinkdb into next\"_)\n3) Very long messages (difficult to read in a terminal): _\"Changing Tornado python driver Cursor.fetch_next to return True if there is an error on the cursor, so users don't accidentally miss errors - OTS review by @mlucy\"_\n4) _\"WIP: Split ReQL-specific stuff out of B-tree logic.\"_ Why is a work-in-progress in the main branch?\n5) _\"Ahm the previous commit made all reads stall because I used fifo_enforcer_queue incorrectly.\"_ If the parent commit did something wrong, why not simply remove it?\n6) Same with: _\"One more abstraction in varint.cc\"_ right before _\"Reverting last changes as it is not directly related to Rethinkdb\"_\n\nI haven't contributed to RethinkDB at all and I'm not in position to argue strongly about this. It's only an observation which I felt could have some value if shared. I hope I haven't stepped on any toes, as that was not the intention.\n"
