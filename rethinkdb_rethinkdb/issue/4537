        "With the risk of coming across as an arrogant ass, I've been peeking at the commit history of RethinkDB and find it to be somewhat messy in places. I think some basic guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and some occasional tough love by the maintainers before merging PRs would be beneficial for all parties. I don't think asking contributors to rebase their branches and clean up their commit messages before a PR is accepted is too much to ask.\r\n\r\nFor people contributing to the project, guidelines helps reduce confusion about the expectations on building a successful PR. For maintainers, nice commit messages and branches helps with code review. Lastly, for an outsider like me, a pretty commit history helps me build confidence in the maturity and stability of the project as a whole.\r\n\r\nSome examples from the last few months:\r\n\r\n1) Commit messages without any real content: *\"merged\"*, *\"bugfixes\"*, etc.\r\n2) Redundant merges (many instances of *\"Merge branch 'next' of github.com:rethinkdb/rethinkdb into next\"*)\r\n3) Very long messages (difficult to read in a terminal): *\"Changing Tornado python driver Cursor.fetch_next to return True if there is an error on the cursor, so users don't accidentally miss errors - OTS review by @mlucy\"*\r\n4) *\"WIP: Split ReQL-specific stuff out of B-tree logic.\"* Why is a work-in-progress in the main branch?\r\n5) *\"Ahm the previous commit made all reads stall because I used fifo_enforcer_queue incorrectly.\"* If the parent commit did something wrong, why not simply remove it?\r\n6) Same with: *\"One more abstraction in varint.cc\"* right before *\"Reverting last changes as it is not directly related to Rethinkdb\"*\r\n\r\nI haven't contributed to RethinkDB at all and I'm not in position to argue strongly about this. It's only an observation which I felt could have some value if shared. I hope I haven't stepped on any toes, as that was not the intention."
