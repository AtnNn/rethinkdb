      "I'm always a bit wary of things that increase the surface area for driver maintenance whenever a ReQL term changes. Right now there's nothing in either ql2.proto nor even in the (already more detailed) term specification that the Java driver uses ( https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/java/term_info.json ).\r\n\r\nI think we should wait with this until we have moved the Python driver to auto-generate its code from something like the Java driver's term_info.json, which we could then extend accordingly to include names for the positional arguments."
