        "`rethinkdb` itself sets the soft file descriptor limit (`nofile`) equal to the hard limit on startup.\r\nHowever the hard limit might still be rather low on some systems, often just 4096.\r\n\r\nWhen starting `rethinkdb` manually, the limit can be changed easily by configuring `/etc/security/limits.conf` But these limits are not always applies to init scripts (see e.g. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4447).\r\n\r\nWe should consider calling `ulimit -n X` in our `init` script, and set the value sufficiently high (alternatively: make it configurable). Upstart seems to have a ulimit option that you can specify in the service description. I'm not sure about systemd."
