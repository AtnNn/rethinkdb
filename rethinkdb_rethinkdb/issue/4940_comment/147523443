      "Piping data to `logger(1)` will send messages to the local syslog. You could send your messages to e.g. `local1` with `logger`'s command line flags and then could configure `/etc/rsyslog.conf` to forward those to a remote syslog server (and log them to local files too, if you want.) I don't know the precise details of all this, but it's what was used at multiple of my previous jobs."
