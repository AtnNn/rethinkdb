      "@danielmewes like @neumino said we were working on exactly this over in neumino/rethinkdbdash#95. The only real issue I ran into was after wrapping `Term` in a `Proxy` object I could no longer get those objects to pass `instanceof Term` checks.\r\n\r\nIt's really awesome to use, though. If someone can figure that part out I think we should definitely do it in the official driver."
