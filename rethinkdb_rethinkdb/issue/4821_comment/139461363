      "Yea I had this issue with `instanceof`. I patched by adding a new method like `_isTerm`. But then I ran into other issues like `Object.keys(<proxy>)`, `<proxy>.hasOwnProperty`, `JSON.stringify` etc. Every time I was patching something, another issue was coming up.\r\n\r\nIt's probably doable, but it's just a bit tedious I think."
