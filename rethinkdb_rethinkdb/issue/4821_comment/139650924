      "Since lambdas work and operator overloading isn't possible [yet](http://www.slideshare.net/BrendanEich/value-objects). I think we should close this issue. The bracket syntax vs. attribute syntax seems nice, but that wasn't in the original request. I have some qualms about the attribute syntax, but I think we should open a new issue for that if it's something people want."
