        "Seems there is a infinite page reloading issue with at least version 8.x of safari and the web admin console. (I could not get this to happen with firefox or opera.) It seems to happen randomly while navigating through the admin console. One way to trigger it is to open the main page, stop the rethinkdb server and wait untill the disconnected message appears in the browser. Once you see that, start rethink back up and it should trigger the issue. If necessary, I can provide a screen capture.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nJavascript Console repeats the following output:\r\n[Error] Failed to load resource: The network connection was lost.
