      "@danielmewes, I think you're missing the use case for `table_wait`.  It should be used after a `reconfigure` or `rebalance` to wait until a table comes back up, and we already know from the directory that everything is in place.  The timeout is to verify that other nodes in the cluster have realized this and can successfully perform the query.  Even if this verification fails, we can still return because the wait was successful.\r\n\r\nIf it didn't involve intra-cluster messages to verify table readiness, I would be inclined to agree with you, but we cannot even be sure that the table is capable of handling queries **the same instant the dummy query succeeds**."
