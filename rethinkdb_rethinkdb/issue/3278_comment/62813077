      "@danielmewes, the directory indicated that the cluster was in an acceptable state to run queries.  The point of polling is to wait for that state to propagate to both the client thread and whichever reactor is running the master for each shard.\r\n\r\nThe timeout duration is long enough such that a timeout should indicate there was some other disruption in table availability.  In this case, we return success - we give the user no guarantee that the table will *stay* available once the wait is complete.  Such a guarantee would be impossible, since a server could go down the instant we reply to a `table_wait` query."
