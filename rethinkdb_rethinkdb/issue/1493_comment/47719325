      "Oh and by \"Jepsen 503\" I meant \"Jepsen 501(c)(3)\", the hypothetical Jepsen non-profit @aphyr mentioned. I think I must have had the HTTP status code on my mind.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as @coffeemug said earlier:\r\n\r\n> Moving to backlog for now. FYI @novabyte -- we do this via internal tools, but we'll definitely get a publicly reproducible version of this (hopefully with widely available tools) at some point.\r\n\r\nThe Jepsen series has obviously revealed that internal testing can sometimes be limited, but for what it's worth the internal testing does exist."
