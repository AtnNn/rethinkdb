      "Yes, unfortunately Jepsen is very much a work in progress but Kyle (Aphyr) has been producing a lot database testing for different databases:\r\n\r\n* Cassandra (http://aphyr.com/posts/294-call-me-maybe-cassandra)\r\n* Kafka (http://aphyr.com/posts/293-call-me-maybe-kafka)\r\n* NuoDB (http://aphyr.com/posts/292-call-me-maybe-nuodb)\r\n* Riak (http://aphyr.com/posts/285-call-me-maybe-riak)\r\n* MongoDB (http://aphyr.com/posts/284-call-me-maybe-mongodb)\r\n* Redis (http://aphyr.com/posts/283-call-me-maybe-redis)\r\n* Postgres (http://aphyr.com/posts/282-call-me-maybe-postgres)\r\n\r\nand: http://aphyr.com/posts/281-call-me-maybe-carly-rae-jepsen-and-the-perils-of-network-partitions\r\n\r\nJepsen's tests are written in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), an example is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aphyr/jepsen/blob/master/src/jepsen/mongo.clj\r\n\r\nI agree it's probably worth marking this as low priority for the moment, it also depends on whether enough consistency controls available in RethinkDB are exposed in the Java client library.\r\n\r\nI mentioned the project because it's **really** worth making it part of the internal benchmarking/test suite used to verify the performance and safety of new RethinkDB releases.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. `:)`"
