      "Hi @aphyr , great news about the modularization. Assuming we can find the time, we'll try to bring the RethinkDB tests over to the new structure.\r\nThe explanation for the commit messages is that we weren't completely sure how things were working and which tests were possible when we started out, so we went to your blog and started by implementing tests from specific articles of yours. So the \"etcd tests\" are similar to the tests that you describe in https://aphyr.com/posts/316-call-me-maybe-etcd-and-consul , but ported to RethinkDB. Those were the first we tried, and I'm not sure if their currently committed configuration is actually very useful for testing RethinkDB at this point. The `rdb_mongo` branch has the `mongo` in it for the same reason. They try to mirror your tests from https://aphyr.com/posts/322-call-me-maybe-mongodb-stale-reads ."
