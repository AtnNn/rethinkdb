      "@dminkovsky Having him do it would serve as a one-time independent verification of RethinkDB's ability to handle partitioning events.  They probably want to either incorporate a Jepsen suite that he writes, or write their own, to use as part of their regression testing suite though.  It's easy to make changes to a complex system that can have disastrous implications for subtle semantics and if those semantics aren't continuously under test, one stands a good chance of having such breakage go unnoticed."
