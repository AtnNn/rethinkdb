      "@aphyr -- I opened a pull request with what I have at https://github.com/aphyr/jepsen/pull/70 .  It pulls the current 2.1 beta release (which is known to have bugs) from the Internet, and requires a slightly-patched version of `clj-rethinkdb` to run (I link to it in the description of the merge).  If you want to wait until the actual release to merge it I can update it to pull the right version and use the mainline `clj-rethinkdb` (which will probably support error types by then).\r\n\r\n@danielcompton -- my changes to the clojure driver are at https://github.com/mlucy/clj-rethinkdb/tree/mlucy_error_types .  Basically we added fine-grained error types in 2.1.  The error hierarchy is changing a little before the final release (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4559), but once that's in I'll update the branch and open a pull request."
