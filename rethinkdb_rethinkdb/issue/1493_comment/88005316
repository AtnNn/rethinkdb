      "I'll pitch in with a non-technical comment. I'm looking for a DB for a new project. RethinkDB looks tempting, but there is the trust issue: databases are hard, distributed databases way more so. Jepsen has become the reference: a reality check for various claims being made. After reading a Jepsen article carefully, I know whether I can trust a distributed DB to get things relatively right.\r\n\r\nI'm writing this to suggest that once you do get auto-failover working, you should ensure that Jepsen results are published.\r\n"
