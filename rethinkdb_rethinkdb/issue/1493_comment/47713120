      "@dminkovsky Not sure what you mean by this:\r\n\r\n> But I hope they'd only shell out if Jepsen 503 would ensure all truly confirmed writes and CAP-defying availability.\r\n\r\nNot sure what you mean by \"ensure\".  If you mean \"thoroughly validates\", then well, Jepsen is quite brutal and capable of simulating virtually any network partition event -- and even if it isn't *comprehensive*, coverage of some aspect of the problem domain is better than no coverage.  If you mean \"corrects the behavior of\", that isn't Jepsen's role.  I ask here what you mean because brining up the potential cost makes me think you mean the second interpretation, but the first is really the only one that makes sense to me."
