      "To be completely clear: RethinkDB 1.16 does not have automatic failover. RethinkDB 2.0 will not have automatic failover. We're actively working on automatic failover, but it requires some big changes under the hood, and we're expecting to ship sometime around April or May. We're planning to test RethinkDB against Jepsen once we've implemented automatic failover."
