      "@mlucy has implemented a few test scenarios with Jepsen and they're passing on the development branch.\r\n\r\nThe remaining item in this issue I think is to prepare a pull request for the Clojure driver, and if possible one for our Jepsen adaptation as well.\r\n\r\nThe code is currently in https://github.com/rethinkdb/jepsen in the branches rdb and rdb_mongo."
