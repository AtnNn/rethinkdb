      "@lamielle -- they were definitely helpful to run.  I'd have to go back and look at the issue history to remember what they actually found, but I remember them being useful.  They also spurred progress on a new feature (typed errors) since the Jepsen tests distinguish between failed and indeterminate operations, and previously the only way to tell those apart was to look at the error messages.  Writing up a blog post on the process and what we found would probably be a good project."
