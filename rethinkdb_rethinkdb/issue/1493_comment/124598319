      "In an attempt to make Jepsen tests more modular and less prone to breaking as core changes, I've made Jepsen into a library and split out the tests into their own projects. Take a look at, say, https://github.com/aphyr/jepsen/tree/master/disque for an example of how to structure your tests. :)"
