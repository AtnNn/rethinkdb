      "> Don't assume that O(1) count would use the stats block.\r\n\r\nIn fact I'll assume that right now (but will try not to assume that in general, fair enough).\r\n\r\nAssuming that we implement O(1) count using the stats block or a similar structure, the general problem is that we must not count documents twice if we have replicas in a cluster by the way. We would probably have to keep counts on a per-shard level, and that would require recomputing/adjusting the per-shard counts when resharding. It needs some thought."
