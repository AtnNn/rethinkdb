      "> This is why you shouldn't assume we'd have counts in the stats block. It's probably better to maintain them for subtrees in the LBA.\r\n\r\nYeah I assumed that mostly because the count is already there (it's actually the only thing in there as far as I know). If we do it for subtrees, it probably shouldn't be in the LBA either. But we could certainly have a block_id -> subtree count map somewhere (it could just be a second btree)."
