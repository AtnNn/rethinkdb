      "`r.table().count({approx: true})` is nice too. A problem with it is that it would only work on plain tables. For example if you have an array or a selection (something like `r.table(t).between(a, b).count({approx: true})`), count({approx: true}) would fail.\r\nGiven that it is really an exclusive property of tables, I think I would prefer having it in `info()`.\r\n\r\n@neumino: #1118 would do it, but it seems like it's pretty far away."
