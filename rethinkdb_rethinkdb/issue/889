        "I think that in addition to attribute names, we should let people pass patterns to pluck specified as objects, with the following semantics:\n- If an attribute maps to `true`, include that attribute.\n- If an attribute maps to an object, recurse into that object.\n- If an attribute maps to an array, recurse into that array.\n- If an attribute maps to `NULL` or `false`, exclude it.  (This is useful because it allows people to construct plucks that behave differently based on a piece of code they execute.)\n- Any other value for an attribute is an error.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` ruby\n> obj = {:a => {:b => 1, :c => 2}, \n         :d => [{:e => 1, :f => 2}, \n                {:e => 3, :f => 4}]}\n\n> obj.pluck({:a => {:b => true}})\n{:a => {:b => 1}}\n\n> obj.pluck({:a => true, :d => [{:e => true}]})\n{:a => {:b => 1, :c => 2}, :d => [{:e => 1}, {:e => 3}]}\n\n> obj.pluck({:a => true, :d => [{:e => true, :f => false}]})\n{:a => {:b => 1, :c => 2}, :d => [{:e => 1}, {:e => 3}]}\n\n> obj.pluck({:a => obj[:a].do{|a| a[:b].eq(1)}, :d => false})\n{:a => {:b => 1, :c => 2}}\n\n> obj.pluck({:a => obj[:a].do{|a| a[:b].eq(2)}, :d => false})\n{}\n```\n"
