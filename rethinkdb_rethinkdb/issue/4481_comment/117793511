      "To solve this problem properly, we will need to change how the driver handshake works, and exchange versions explicitly. Currently the magic we send at the beginning of a connection is used both for detecting things connecting to the wrong port, as well as to detect the protocol version being used. This will probably happen as part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3134.\r\n\r\nAs an immediate improvement, just changing the error message sounds ok.\r\nMaybe something like \"ERROR: Bad magic number. Are you connecting to the wrong port (this is the RethinkDB client protocol port)? Are you using a driver that is too new for the server?\""
