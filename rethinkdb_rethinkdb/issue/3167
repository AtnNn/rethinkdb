        "When spinning up a server in our testing infrastructure using `test/common/driver.py` we have two variables that can be assigned: `log_path` and `logfile_path`. It is non-obvious that the first refers to where stderr/stdout from the server process goes (default: stdout), and the second is the location that the server log goes.\r\n\r\nI am proposing changing `log_path` to `console_output`, which is much more descriptive. This is not a difficult task, but it is going to be a bit involved since there are at least 111 instances in 38 files and I want to separate this from other work."
