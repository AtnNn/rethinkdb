      "I was planning to suggest the 2nd solution to which I arrived after starting with the 1st. I was also thinking that this might be complicated implementation wise, but while I think I could get used to the 1st, I find it a bit more less legible. \r\n\r\nHow about:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nobj.set({'attr1': {'attr2': {'attr3': value}}})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's longer, but the structure/depth is more obvious. \r\n\r\n_update_: isn't the above already possible with `obj.merge`?"
