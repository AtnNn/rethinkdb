      "So here's a proposal for a simple syntax we can add that isn't terribly hard and I think covers a lot of the issues people were running in to.\r\n```Python\r\nobj.set('attr1', 'attr2', 'attr3', value)\r\n```\r\nThe imperative version of this would be:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nobj['attr1']['attr2']['attr3'] = value\r\nreturn obj\r\n```\r\n\r\nPeople would probably prefer the version with the imperative look but I think we're going to have trouble fitting that nicely in to our query language. There's a lot of questions that come up there."
