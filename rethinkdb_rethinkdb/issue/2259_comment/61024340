      "@danielmewes, the current implementation is equivalent to `wait_for='all_replicas_up'`.  We decided to go with the most-conservative readiness as the default.\r\n\r\nIf the optarg is decided on, it's actually trivial to implement - the different levels of readiness are hooked up all the way through the stack except for the top-level `table_wait_term_t`."
