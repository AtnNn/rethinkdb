      "I'm OK with this. I would suggest making `ready_completely` the default, since it's more conservative. Also, this latest proposal seems a bit verbose. What about\r\n```\r\nr.table_wait('foo', ready_for='outdated_reads')\r\nr.table_wait('foo', ready_for='reads')\r\nr.table_wait('foo', ready_for='writes')\r\nr.table_wait('foo', ready_for='completely')\r\n```\r\nAlso, keep in mind that renaming the fields on `table_status` is an option."
