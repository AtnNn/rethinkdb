      "I think an opt arg to specify the expected degree of \"readyness\" would be good.\r\n\r\nHere's the same proposal with slightly different names, which might or might not be better:\r\n```\r\nr.table_wait('foo', wait_for='outdated_readable')\r\nr.table_wait('foo', wait_for='readable')\r\nr.table_wait('foo', wait_for='writable') <- default\r\nr.table_wait('foo', wait_for='all_shards')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also think that returning an array on multiple tables and a single object on a single table is fine."
