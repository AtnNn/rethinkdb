      "imho I think adding table_wait/tableWait is an overkill because this issue can happen in different situations / operations (createTable pr neumino's example, insert/delete or other operations when cluster is not ready due to sharding or connecting to a machine that just went up etc) all of which would need to be handled manually by the developer; from a usability point of view I think as a user I shouldn't have to worry about this and the driver should somehow take care of this internally\r\n"
