      ":+1: for the same semantics between related commands\r\n\r\nI also think we should drop the optarg and do the most conservative thing. I think the optarg is seriously over-engineering the thing. I'd also drop the different readiness states from the status table and consolidate them into a single boolean `ready` field. Four fields is really an overkill -- people won't understand what they're all for and how they differ, and the utility of giving users all this information is very questionable. If people want more control we can always add it later, but I think it's both unnecessary for 1.16/reql-admin-v1, and has a good change of hurting usability of the API."
