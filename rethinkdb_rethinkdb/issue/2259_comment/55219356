      ":+1: for this proposal -- I think it's awesome. WRT what `table_wait` should return, I think returning an array of `table_status` documents is a great idea. (I also think `table_create` should return those too). It's heavyweight, but it's ok. It gives me the amazing feeling of integratedness with the rest of the system. Clustering, reql, and everything else has come full circle and is one beautiful whole."
