      "@1N50MN14 from #2906\r\n\r\n> That's a good point. I think that r.table_create() should keep its current behavior, but writing to the pseudo-table should not wait for the table to be ready. We should implement the proposed r.table_wait(). Then we can implement r.table_create() as a porcelain on rethinkdb.table_config, table.reconfigure(), and r.table_wait().\r\n\r\nThe implementation of `table_wait` is not for general driver users. It would be used by drivers behind `table_create` and available if a developer wanted to do something advanced."
