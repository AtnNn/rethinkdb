      "One concern I have with adding `r.tableWait` is that it looks suspiciously like `r.indexWait`, so people might expect to always use it in exactly the same way. However, the behavior of the whole flow is different -- `r.tableCreate` returns only when the table is ready (once #2201 is fixed), while `r.indexCreate` returns immediately. People might expect to have to always call `r.tableWait` after `r.tableCreate`, while in reality `r.tableWait` would be a niche command helpful for testing and automation.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean we shouldn't add it, though, as the command is clearly useful. We just have to make sure users don't get confused."
