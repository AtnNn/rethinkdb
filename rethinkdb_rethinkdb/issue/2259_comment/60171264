      "> What's the difference in time between waiting for the different states? Also, what can be done when the table is \"completely\" ready vs. when it's writable?\r\n\r\nIt depends on the situation.  If secondaries for a table are available, but primaries are not, the table should be ready for outdated reads.  This situation could continue indefinitely.  When primaries are available, the table should be able to take reads and writes (I assume at roughly the same time), but maybe @timmaxw can clarify the meaning of these.\r\n\r\nAs for being completely ready vs writable, there is no difference in query capability, though there may be some throughput loss due to ongoing backfills."
