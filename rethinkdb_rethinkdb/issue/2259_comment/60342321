      "Not having the opt arg and assuming the most conservative thing (all shards up) wouldn't work in @1N50MN14 's use case as far as I understand it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use `tableWait()` to handle temporary node failures in your application by waiting until the required node(s) come (back) up, and `tableWait()` uses the conservative all shards up criteria, that would mean that your application would go down as soon as *any* shard goes down."
