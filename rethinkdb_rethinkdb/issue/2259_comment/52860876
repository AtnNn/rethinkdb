      "I think we should definitely implement `table_wait`.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be opposed to having commands that need tables wait for, say, up to 5 seconds (configurable with an optarg) before returning an error, but I don't think we want them to wait indefinitely.  People should have to call `table_wait` if they want to wait indefinitely."
