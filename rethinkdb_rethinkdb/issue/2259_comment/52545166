      "This issue causes problems with changes(); I have a code which attempts to reconnect to the db as soon as the machine goes down; upon connection I start listening to change events which throws the following `cannot subscribe to table `emitterEvents`: Master for shard [\"\", +inf) not available...`\r\n\r\nProblem is there's no way to know when the table is ready or it's OK to start listening to `changes()` (possibly perform other operations)..  It would be nice to have some sort of `ready` event in this case..\r\n"
