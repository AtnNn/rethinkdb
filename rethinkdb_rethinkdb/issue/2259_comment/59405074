      "Prioritizing for 1.16.\r\n@1N50MN14 also just explained to me again why this would be very useful.\r\n\r\nIn addition to waiting for tables that have just been created, `tableWait()` should also wait if a table is temporarily unavailable because the primary of one of the shards has become unreachable. If we use our existing `test_for_rdb_table_readiness()` function I believe we automatically get that behavior."
