      "If at all possible, I would consider waiting for 1.17 and shipping this with the reql-admin changes. The benefit of doing that is that `table_wait` can output the same document as the one in the `table_status` table, which makes for a beautiful, unified API. Otherwise, we'd have to return something else and then change it later when reql_admin ships, which is a bit annoying."
