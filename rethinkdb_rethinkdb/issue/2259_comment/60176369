      "I agree that `ready_completely` should be renamed; it has confused everyone who's seen it so far.\r\n\r\nI would be OK with ready-for-writes as the default. However, I'm worried that it might be a bad idea to send writes while a backfill is occurring; this will fill up the backfill queue, slow down the backfill, and slow down the writes. I don't have a good sense for how strong these effects are, and if you don't think there's any reason to wait for a backfill to finish, then that sounds OK to me."
