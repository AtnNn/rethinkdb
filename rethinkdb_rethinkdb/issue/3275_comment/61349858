      "Yep. Except for \"director\", it might not be worth changing every instance of the terms, because it would create merge conflicts.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it's reasonable for us to keep using the term \"secondary\" (short for \"secondary replica\"). I think we use that term a lot in the code, and it would be nice not to have to change every instance of it."
