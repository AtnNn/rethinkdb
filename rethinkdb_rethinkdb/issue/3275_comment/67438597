      "This is in review 2411.  The most notable side-effect is that the `director_tag` optarg to `reconfigure` is now `primary_replica_tag`.  Several instances of `master` have been left in the code, mostly in the reactor code, as there is a `master_t` which is distinct from the concept of a primary replica.\r\n\r\nI used all the grepping I could to get as much as possible, including in the tests, drivers, and web ui, although it's possible a comment or error message slipped through."
