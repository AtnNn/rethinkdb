      "Status update: I wrote a test for this in python, but I ran into some issues when writing it in Javascript. I need to talk to @atnnn tomorrow about how to do it properly in js and we'll be good. I don't anticipate many problems here.\r\n\r\nMy only concern is that some JS/mocha/connection tests appear to be wrong (as in, they do not do what we think they do). Will talk to relevant people about it tomorrow and try to fix what I can."
