      "Currently you'd have to do an indexed `between` and chain on `orderBy` without an index. I'm not actually sure if other databases support this type of behavior -- doing a query by one index and ordering by another index is algorithmically very hard, and it's not clear to me that it's actually implementable in a way that's more efficient than a memory sort.\r\n\r\nWe will look into it, though."
