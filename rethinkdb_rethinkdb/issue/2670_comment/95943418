      "Perhaps I can, but I don't know how. I tried, but I get \"Cannot order by index `last-op` after calling BETWEEN on index `owner`\" (I just tried doing (r/between 1 1 {:index \"owner\"}) (r/order-by {:index (r/desc \"last-op\")}).\r\n\r\nFrom the docs:\r\n\r\n> Currently, you cannot chain an orderBy using a secondary index after a getAll but only after a table. (You can, however, chain an orderBy using a secondary index after a between if they use the same index.)\r\n\r\nSo I guess I can't, because those would be two different indices.\r\n"
