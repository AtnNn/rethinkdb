      "I tried doing:\r\n\r\n    (r/between [1 1] [0 r/maxval] {:index \"owner-last-op\"})\r\n    (r/order-by {:index (r/desc \"owner-last-op\")})\r\n\r\nusing my compound index on [owner last-op]. It seems to work, at least it doesn't throw an error, and returns the right results. I don't know what it does on the server side.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug I think this shouldn't be a problem if we're dealing with a single compound index?\r\n"
