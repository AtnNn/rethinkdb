      "I think I've just hit this limitation, so here's a use case for @neumino:\r\n\r\nI have a table that contains data with (among others) {:owner uid :last-op timestamp}. I often need to get all documents that belong to a particular owner, sorted by timestamp. I have a compound index on [uid timestamp]. I was certain I could just use a getAll/orderBy with this compound index, but it turned out I could not. I then tried using two separate indices (one on :owner and one on :last-op), but this only got me to \"Indexed order_by can only be performed on a TABLE or TABLE_SLICE\".\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, the only option right now is to get all documents for a given uid using an index on :owner and then do an in-memory sort. This will not work well for larger amounts of documents.\r\n\r\n"
