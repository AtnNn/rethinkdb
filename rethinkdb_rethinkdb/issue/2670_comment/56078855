      "Contributing my use case as per request from @neumino:\r\n\r\nI work for an analytics platform that aggregates any data about users/sessions/devices/events our clients send us. Any data means, basically, each of those documents can have any attributes with whatever data types.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that we need each attribute to be fully searchable and the documents to be filtered by any combination of those attributes. So two alternatives: creating an index on each attribute and try to use the most significant one when filtering (how to find out which is the best is another story) or, as this issue proposes, make a compound index on all attributes and use part of it as required.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, queries are going to take a hell of a long time to complete due to the constant table scans and comparisons."
