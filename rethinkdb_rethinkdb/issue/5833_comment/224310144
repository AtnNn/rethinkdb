      "Did you build from source? Had you installed 2.2.2 the same way or did you use a package for it?\r\n\r\nIf you had installed RethinkDB 2.2.2 through a package before, you should uninstall that first (`sudo apt-get remove rethinkdb` if you're on Ubuntu or Debian).\r\nTry running `sudo make install` in the 2.3.x source directory to install the new version. Then restart the server (`sudo service rethinkdb restart`)."
