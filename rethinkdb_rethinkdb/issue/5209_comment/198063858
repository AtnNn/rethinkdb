      "@ronzeidman \r\n> Are there any bad binaries that cannot be coerced to strings and back?\r\n\r\nYes, strings must be valid UTF-8 strings. So some binary data isn't a valid string.\r\n\r\nI don't think there currently is any way in ReQL to concatenate binary data.\r\n\r\nThe original idea behind the binary data type was really just to store small blobs, such as avatar images, but not to do any processing (or incremental updating) on them."
