      "+1\r\nI agree with the proposal, the first thing I tried was \"append\" when that didn't work I tried \"union\" only than I remembered that \"add\" worked for arrays. then I searched for it online.\r\nI think \"union\" is the best fit.\r\nin the meantime is there a better way than \r\n`<some binary>.coerceTo('string').add(<someOtherBinary>.coerceTo('string')).coerceTo('binary')`\r\nAre there any bad binaries that cannot be coerced to strings and back?"
