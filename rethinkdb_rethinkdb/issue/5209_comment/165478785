      "Well for the sake of consistency I have to agree with @mlucy, although in my opinion `add` should have not been used for concatenating arrays in the first place (concatenating strings seems more intuitive though). After all `number.add(number)` does not concatenate numbers, but `add` them, so the current usage is less intuitive, since there's more to remember about the overloads of the method. It's also not something that's used in other languages - I can't think of a language where `array + array` means `concat(array, array)`, whereas `binary + binary` in commonly used to mean the sum of binary values (e.g. JavaScript: `0b1 + 0b1 = 2`."
