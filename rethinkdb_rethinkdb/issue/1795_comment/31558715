      "I added secondary names for tables into the admin CLI's `name_map`, such that the secondary name is `<db>.<table>` (when applicable, does not happen if there is a vector clock conflict).  The `name_map` is used for looking up names provided to a command or when using tab-completion.\r\n\r\nThis was actually a rather simple change.  Now, whenever a command might expect a table, the following can be used to refer to it:\r\n* UUID\r\n* `<db_name>.<table_name>` - When there are no vclock conflicts in table.db, table.name, or db.name\r\n* `<table_name>` - When the table name is unique across all databases"
