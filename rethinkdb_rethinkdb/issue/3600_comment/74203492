      "@deontologician you're talking about implementing `.toStream()` on queries, not the `cursor` object right?\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that currently `rethinkdbdash` simply drops `null` values from the stream but as @neumino mentioned there are other options. I would lean towards emitting `undefined` in place of `null` but keep in mind that's only supported as of v0.12.0."
