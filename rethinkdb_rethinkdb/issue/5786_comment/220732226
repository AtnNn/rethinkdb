      "Oh interesting, it seems to be using libcrypto from /usr/lib, but libssl from external. That definitely looks like an issue with our build system.\r\n\r\nHere are another two potential options for working around this:\r\n* Don't install libssl-dev\r\n* Alternatively: keep installing libssl-dev, but remove the `--fetch openssl` flag from the `configure` line.\r\n\r\n(pinging @larkost)."
