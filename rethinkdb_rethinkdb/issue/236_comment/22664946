      "Using hostnames might actually be a bad idea. For one thing there's a number of situations where you might want to put multiple servers on the same machine. There isn't a great reason I can think of to do this in production but you might well do it if you're just playing around with RethinkDB and want to test out administrative things like sharding with multiple machines. It would kind of be a pain if you loaded up your cluster and had a name conflict to start. This could also be a bit confusing if people migrate over data files because then machines will be mislabelled. I think the better thing to do is keep names as they are and have a field similar to IPs in the directory that lists a current machines hostname and maybe display this as mouseover information on machine names and in the detailed view for machines."
