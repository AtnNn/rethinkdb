      "This post is in no way support of this issue. The poster makes a joke about the fact that when he upgraded his server name changed from \"Beastmaster\" to \"Tiny\" and he's not sure how he feels about this, presumably because the name \"Tiny\" isn't as bad ass as the name \"Beastmaster\". He never mentions hostname in his post. If anything this shows that this guy finds our names charming."
