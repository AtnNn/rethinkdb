        "I'm not sure if this is a bug (it very much seems like one), and what consequences it has. @srh, you should have a look at this.\n\nIn mc_inner_buf_t::allocate(), we have code which handles the case that an inner_buf is kept around after deletion of a block if it is still snapshotted. We re-use the inner buffer by resetting its properties. This is done by calling inner_buf->initialize_to_new().\n\nHowever, we do not reset the block_size attribute of mc_inner_buffer_t. In the mc_inner_buf_t constructor for new blocks, we initialize block_size to block_size_t::undefined().\n\nI'm pretty sure that we should also reset it to undefined when re-using an old buffer.\n"
