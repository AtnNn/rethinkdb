        "1. If you try to use a data directory from a future RethinkDB version with RethinkDB 1.13, a guarantee failure `disk_format_version_is_recognized(mb_temp->disk_format_version)` is triggered. Instead we should print a friendly message explaining what's going on and shut down the server.\r\n\r\n2. When connecting two incompatible RethinkDB nodes in a cluster, a message such as `warn: Connection attempt from 127.0.0.1 with unresolvable protocol version: 1.13` or even `warn: Received invalid clustering header from 127.0.0.1, closing connection -- something might be connecting to the wrong port.` is printed to the log.\r\nWe should a) improve these messages and b) maybe make them show up as a message in the web UI?"
