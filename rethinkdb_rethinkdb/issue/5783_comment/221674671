      "Have you seen this more than once?\r\n\r\nFrom a quick look at the code, it looks like this is probably a race condition during intra-cluster connection setup. Once the connections are up, it should not run into it anymore. So for now, just restarting the servers will likely be enough to keep things running, unless reconnects within the cluster are very frequent for some reason.\r\n\r\nWe'll investigate the bug."
