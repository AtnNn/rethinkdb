      "Seems to be related to the V8 version.\r\n`./configure --allow-fetch --static v8` fetches version 3.22.24.17 and is slow.\r\n\r\nChanging `mk/support/pkg/v8.sh` to fetch 3.7.12.22 makes the build fast.\r\n\r\nInterestingly it's even faster when linking with V8 3.7.12.22 statically, even though that's the same version I've installed on my system. The same query now only takes 0.21s instead of 0.85s with the system-wide libv8 of the same version."
