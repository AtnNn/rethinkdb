      "@AtnNn found the problem: V8 compiles first without a snapshot, and then in a second step generates the snapshot. Whether the snapshot is used or not depends on which subset of the `.o` files it generates are linked.\r\nWe currently link all of them, making it depend on the linking order.\r\n\r\n@AtnNn already has fix for this in his branch for #3423. He's going to backport it to v1.16.x."
