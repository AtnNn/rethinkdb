      "I think objects of the form `{uuid: <uuid>, name: <name>}` might be better than arrays of two element just because they make the code that access them more obvious.  (I always hate it when I'm reading code and it's like `obj['shards'][0]['primary_replica'][0]` instead of `obj['shards'][0]['primary_replica']['uuid']`, both because it isn't obvious what the `0` refers to and because it isn't obvious that you aren't just getting the first element of a set.)"
