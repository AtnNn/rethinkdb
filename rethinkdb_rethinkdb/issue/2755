I was working with @danielmewes we checked for cpu spikes and other things and there was nothing.\r\n\r\nThere was an interesting log line:\r\nwarn: Received invalid clustering header from 123.123.123.123, closing connection -- something might be connecting to the wrong port.\r\n\r\notherwise there was a lot of connect and disconnects and then at some point it looks like it simply gave up trying to reconnect again.\r\n"
