      "A work-around that's more work to implement is to keep track of the document count for certain ranges in your application, by explicitly storing and updating a \"count\" document in a separate table. This usually works best if you know for which ranges you'll need counts, and if you're ok with having the count be slightly off if the count update query fails or something else goes wrong."
