      "@jilen the technical details of the better solution are sketched out in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3949#issuecomment-84143955 . Basically the idea is to store document counts for each subrange in the index itself, so that we can immediately retrieve the counts without having to look at each node in the index.\r\nUnfortunately that solution *is* more involved, and that's what my original ~6 month estimate was based on.\r\n\r\nThe improvement described in this thread is easier. I'll need to check how much work it actually is. It might be very easy, or pretty annoying to implement.\r\nThe performance advantage is going to vary, depending on the type of data stored and on whether the index fits into cache or not (if it doesn't fit into cache, this improvement will make practically no difference)."
