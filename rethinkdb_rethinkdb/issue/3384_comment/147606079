      "@jilen Uhm actually I confused this with issue #152 and #3949 which are about making `count()` on ranges a constant-time operation. Those are a lot of work.\r\n\r\nThis issue is just about a constant-factor improvement in CPU usage, which would be easier to do. However I'm not sure if it's worth putting time into this when we'll have a much better solution in the medium term."
