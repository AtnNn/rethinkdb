      "@jilen I'm not sure if there's much we can do with the current version. What kind of time are you currently getting for that query?\r\n\r\nIt might be worth checking whether it's CPU bound, or if it might have to load data from disk. If it has to access disk, you might be able to increase the RethinkDB cache size a bit to get more of the data into memory (see the `--cache-size` command line argument).\r\n\r\nIf it's CPU bound, we are going to have some marginal optimizations to secondary-index based traversals like this in the next release (2.2). But it's only going to be in the range of ~50% more speed at most (see #4862)."
