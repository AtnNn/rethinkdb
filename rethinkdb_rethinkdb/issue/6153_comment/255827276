      "That error seems to be from a python script in the V8 build.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a `pip install bz2` might work, or maybe your Python installation is be broken, or maybe V8 downloads it's own broken version of python to build itself?\r\n\r\nYou may have to change how V8 is built to be able to cross-compile RethinkDB. The build script is in `mk/support/pkg/v8.sh`.\r\n\r\nThe last version of RethinkDB that I was able to cross-compile on x86_64 for ARM was 2.0 or 2.1. I haven't tried cross-compiling it since."
