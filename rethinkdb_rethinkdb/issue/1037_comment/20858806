      "Having looked into this some I have determined that the node streams interface isn't quite stable enough and we're better off sticking with the existing code which works well enough.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the new interface exhibits some strange behavior with respect to tcp streams that doesn't appear to exist for other kinds of readable streams.\r\n\r\nMoving back to backlog. Maybe after a few more versions of node are released we can revisit."
