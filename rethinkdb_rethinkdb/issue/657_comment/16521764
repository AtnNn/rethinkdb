      "I spent a bit of time trying to write a unit test for this and I don't think it's going to happen. The timings for it are basically impossible. I could spend some time carefully controlling the timings of things to make it happen but considering this is an issue with some obvious solutions and it's never actually come up for anyone I'd be comfortable just fixing it without a test. Anyone strongly object?"
