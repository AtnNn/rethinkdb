      "@Gesias, the python driver connections are not thread-safe, you should either protect them with a mutex or use one connection per thread.  It looks like the connection code is desyncing with the server and reading out the wrong number of bytes - this could certainly happen due to multiple threads accessing the connection at once.\r\n\r\nNote that this also extends to Cursors - reading from a cursor can cause reads to happen on the Cursor's connection, so it should only be done from same thread."
