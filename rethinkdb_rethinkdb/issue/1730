        "When something goes wrong when launching dump/restore scripts, the function `run_backup_script` hardcodes the error message about the missing Python driver. However, in some cases the Python driver is present, but the path to the script is wrong (for example, in case of cron). In this case the user gets the following confusing error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError when launching rethinkdb-dump: No such file or directory\r\nThe rethinkdb-dump command depends on the RethinkDB Python driver, which must be installed.\r\nInstructions for installing the RethinkDB Python driver are available here:\r\nhttp://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/python/\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should make sure the error message only shows up if the Python driver is actually missing (either by moving it to the scripts, or by having the scripts return with an appropriate result if the driver is actually missing)."
