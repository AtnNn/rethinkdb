      "I'm pretty sure that the only reason `func_t`s were being copied across threads were because the copy constructor for `wire_func_t` was preserving its cache when it was copied.  Aside from that, which is fixable (and incorrect now that we're actually managing our JS runner resources properly), I don't think `func_t`s are ever moved cross-thread, or if they are it's an error."
