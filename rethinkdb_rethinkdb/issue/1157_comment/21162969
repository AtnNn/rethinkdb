      "I am unable to reproduce this, but I have a hypothesis as to why it might happen.  In issue #672 we moved to `slow_atomic_countable_t` for `func_t`, but since functions must exist relative to an environment (and in particular, relative to a javascript runner), this seems incorrect.\r\n\r\nIf we change `func_t` to use `single_threaded_countable_t`, and fix all the resulting errors, I think that that should fix this.  We can move everything except `datum_t` and `protob_t` to single threaded countables (those two need to be serialized, unfortunately, and our deserialization process on the shards seems to like moving things cross-thread)."
