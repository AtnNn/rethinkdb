        "This issue is a collection of partially related questions:\r\n\r\n* Should it be possible to call `r.table_reconfigure()` and `r.table_elect_directors()` on a database? Should their parameter be in the form `db_name.table_name` or just `table_name`? Maybe we should go the other way and let `table_create()` and `table_drop()` accept names of the form `db_name.table_name`?\r\n\r\n* Should `table_status` and `table_config` be in a `rethinkdb` database and store rows for all tables in all databases? Or should we have a separate `table_status_<db>` for each database? Maybe it should be `r.db(\"<db>\").table(\"$reql_table_status$\")`? Or `r.db(\"<db>\").table_status()`?\r\n\r\n    If it's DB-specific, the primary key can just be `table_name`; if it's not, the primary key has to be `db_name.table_name`. Should we try to be consistent with `r.table_reconfigure()`? People might want to be able to do something like:\r\n    ```python\r\n    r.db(\"rethinkdb\").table(\"table_config\")\r\n     .foreach(r.table_elect_directors(r.row[\"name\"]))\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* Should we scrap the `rethinkdb` database completely? If so, where do we put `server_status`?\r\n\r\n* Assuming we do have a magic admin database, what should it be called? `rethinkdb`? `_rethinkdb`? `$reql_admin$`? We should look at what other database systems call the corresponding things."
