        "Similar to how we have a `multi` optarg for indexes it would be cool if you could return an array from a group function and have it count the document in multiple groups. For example suppose I have a table, `\"blog_posts\"` and I want to count comments based on tags. I could write:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ntable(\"blog_posts\").group_by(row[\"tags\"], count(\"comment_count\"), multi=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis looks nicer if `group` is a separate function but it's still fairly usable otherwise."
