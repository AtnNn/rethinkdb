      "Hm, good question. Yeah I think the Data Explorer is the most important part. If it's only the data explorer I would prefer a stripped down UI to avoid confusion. I played a little with the CSS just now and with these six rows the UI becomes Data Explorer only, not sure how easy it would be to disable the other logic, but maybe that too can be disabled with a few if statements. \r\n\r\n```css\r\n#updates_container,\r\n#topbar,\r\n#navbar-container,\r\n#footer {\r\n  display: none;\r\n}"
