      "Not sure if it's relevant, but as far as use cases goes I guess providing some background don't hurt. I am the founder of a Cloud/PaaS hosting company called [Sourcevoid](https://www.sourcevoid.com/), our platform is built up from scratch so while I've been working full time for a couple of years building the platform we more recently this summer released the service. \r\n\r\nCurrently we only support Dart and Nodejs in terms of languages and Mongodb in terms of databases. However we are in the process of adding more databases and runtimes. First on my list is SQL for obvious reasons in terms of market share etc (lots of people have been asking for it as well), after that RethinkDB and Redis is the top two alternatives that I personally would like to support, potentially competing with some message queue although Redis pub/sub should work for most simpler use cases (I do find it interesting how RethinkDB also might be able to fill that use case of also acting a bit like a message queue where that pattern is needed).\r\n\r\nI only want to add services that I feel are great and that we can offer good service for (or that are so ubiquitous that they make sense for that reason), RethinkDB would fall into the category of a great new database and for example MySQL into the ubiquitous category. Right now we have an integrated UI for Mongodb where you can list and edit documents and longer term I would like us to provide similar support for other databases that we provide. For me both as a founder of a PaaS company and as a developer I want more than just CLI access, I think having a GUI as well is great for productivity. So in terms of the Data Explorer, if it works good I could see us integrating it into our UI by handling the connection in the background and serve it up in an iframe, as long as the styling don't clash too much. Listing databases and tables we could implement pretty easily ourselves I think, the whole Data Explorer is a bit more complex and it would be nice to be able to use it out of the box. \r\n\r\nThe other use case for us would be that the user connect to the UI locally, in a few weeks we will launch a tool to create private tunnels directly into a customers database instance/cluster. Unlike other PaaS platforms we always setup a real private network for each customers \"resource pool\" (as we call them, includes more than just the network) and the database is never exposed directly to the internet, only inside the private network, therefore the need for the tunnel. To give some context that makes it possible to connect with pgAdmin or MySQL Workbench by connecting to localhost:PORT, to RethinkDB we could setup one tunnel for CLI access and one tunnel for the UI so it can be viewed in the browser locally as well. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Side note*\r\n\r\nI have read about your new effort \"Horizon Cloud\" as well, maybe slightly off topic here but may I ask how RethinkDB as a company view PaaS/DBaaS providers? In one way I would assume that your biggest \"problem\" is like many other new technologies (us included) to really reach out to all developers, most have probably still never heard of or used RethinkDB, in that sense the more PaaS/DBaaS providers the merrier. At the same with, while I have a hard time finding that much details, with Horizon Cloud, RethinkDB seems to want to enter the hosting area as well and then you could argue that the less providers of hosted RethinkDB the better. While again you can argue more providers create a bigger market overall for RethinkDB and having a smaller part of a bigger market can be better than a bigger part of a smaller market. \r\n\r\nNot sure if you are the right person to answer this @danielmewes, I don't mean to put you at the spot here, if not maybe you could ask someone internally to comment, would appreciate that. The last thing I want to do is to step on someones toes or so to speak, that's why I'm asking. I just wanted to get a sense for RethinkDB's stance on this if you want providers like Sourcevoid to offer hosted RethinkDB or not. The whole business model around an open source product is indeed very cool and confusing at the same time, you want to give it away for free and at the same time you need to make money somehow. To put it like this, it's more likely that we add support for RethinkDB if RethinkDB the company is in support of us doing so, if not it might at the end of the day be more worthwhile our time to put more effort into other offerings.
