      "No worries @Scorpiion!\r\n\r\nHorizon Cloud is not primarily a RethinkDB DBaaS service. Hosting RethinkDB instances is a part of it, but only a small one.\r\n\r\nOur primary goal with Horizon Cloud is to provide management tools that scale with your deployment. Offering hosted RethinkDB+Horizon as a PaaS/DBaaS solution is the first step for Horizon Cloud, but will not be the end of what we're planning to offer. I'm not sure how much detail I can expose here right now, but feel free to send me a direct message on Slack if you'd like to discuss this more ( http://slack.rethinkdb.com to get an invite, then https://rethinkdb.slack.com ).\r\n\r\nWe're always excited about offers around RethinkDB that benefit our community."
