        "I'm on RethinkDB 2.0.0.\n\nI tried to run the following in DataExplorer\n\n``` javascript\nr.table('users').filter(r.row('name').count().lt(3))\n```\n\nbut I got the following error:\n\n```\nRqlRuntimeError: Cannot convert STRING to SEQUENCE in:\nr.table(\"users\").filter(r.row(\"name\").count().lt(3))\n                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n```\n\nIt's the same when I use \"id\" instead of \"name\".\n\nIf I change 'name' to any other value, it seems to work. An example of a working query, though identical in structure to the one above, would be:\n\n``` javascript\nr.table('users').filter(r.row('posts').count().lt(3))\n```\n\nIt seems as if somehow \"id\" and \"name\" are reserved in the driver when using `r.row()`, and not blocked from the server, as I have no problems inserting arrays into the `id` and `name` fields:\n\n``` javascript\nr.table('users').insert([{id: [1,2,3]}, {name: [1,2,3]}])\n```\n"
