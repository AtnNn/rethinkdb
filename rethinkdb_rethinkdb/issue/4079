        "I'm on RethinkDB 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nI tried to run the following in DataExplorer\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('users').filter(r.row('name').count().lt(3))\r\n```\r\nbut I got the following error:\r\n```\r\nRqlRuntimeError: Cannot convert STRING to SEQUENCE in:\r\nr.table(\"users\").filter(r.row(\"name\").count().lt(3))\r\n                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's the same when I use \"id\" instead of \"name\".\r\n\r\nIf I change 'name' to any other value, it seems to work. An example of a working query, though identical in structure to the one above, would be:\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('users').filter(r.row('posts').count().lt(3))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems as if somehow \"id\" and \"name\" are reserved in the driver when using `r.row()`, and not blocked from the server, as I have no problems inserting arrays into the `id` and `name` fields:\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('users').insert([{id: [1,2,3]}, {name: [1,2,3]}])\r\n```"
