      "You can build the driver by running `make js-driver` in the branch `michel_1395_promises_squashed` and you'll get the driver with promises in `build/packages/js/`.\r\n\r\nOr you can install it with\r\n```\r\nnpm install http://justonepixel.com/rethinkdb/driver-unstable/rethinkdb.1.12.promises.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n- This is __not__ an official release. I made a tarball just because it's more convenient to install.\r\n- There is no doc for now, but every methods that takes a callback will return a promise if you don't give it a callback.   \r\nThe only exception is `each`, which must be called with a callback.\r\n- You cannot use this tarball with an unstable version of node and `node-protobuf`.\r\nIf you want to use `node-protobuf`, install @atnnn's version of `node-protobuf` http://github.com/atnnn/node-protobuf and make sure you run Node `0.11.10` (not earlier/later versions).    \r\nYou can also use `npm install rethinkdbdash-unstable` if you want to play with `yield` (see https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash)\r\n\r\nAnd one last thing, if you run into a bug, let me know : )\r\n"
