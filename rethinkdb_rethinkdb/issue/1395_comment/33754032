      "@pilwon We have to wait for Node 0.12 to be released first.\r\nThen I'm not quite sure what's going to happen.\r\n\r\nI believe promises/generators will take over the callback, but that's going to take some time (hopefully not too much).\r\nSo we are probably going to keep the two drivers for some time. That would also give rethinkdbdash some time to be tested in the wild.\r\n\r\nThen when promises will be the normal way to write code with Node.js, we'll tag rethinkdbdash as our official Node.js driver.\r\n\r\nWriting the driver was some work, but updating it with new terms is really easy to do, so I'll keep it up to date, no need to worry about that :)"
