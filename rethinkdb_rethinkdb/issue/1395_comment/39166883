      "@neumino -- a few questions:\r\n\r\n- Which are the functions that return promises when the callback is omitted? Could you give a complete list here?\r\n- Do we have tests for this? (I couldn't make out in code review whether we magically transform the current tests to use promises, or whether we need to write more tests)\r\n- Could users mix callback and promises style? I.e. omit a callback for connect, but pass it to `cursor.next`? (We should have some basic tests for what happens here)\r\n- How does this interact with `connection.addListener`?\r\n\r\nAnd some thoughts:\r\n\r\n- We'll have to update the API docs for relevant functions to give examples of both use.\r\n- I think we should write a separate blog post showcasing how cool this is (basically, a mini tutorial), and may be link to it from the docs.\r\n- I now agree with you that we should launch it separately as soon as Node is ready."
