      "- All functions that takes a callback, except `cursor.each` and `addListener` (`r.connect`, `conn.reconnect`, `conn.close`, `conn.noreplyWait`, `run`, `cursor.next`, `cursor.toArray`)\r\n- I wrote test for that: `ql-js-promise`\r\n- You can mix callback and promises, for different invocations. You cannot pass a callback and retrieve a promise (but for example you can pass a callback for `r.connect` and use a promise for `cursor.next`)\r\n- `connection.addListener` doesn't change, promise doesn't really make sense here. A promise is an object that will eventually be \"resolved\".\r\n- The changes are backward compatible. You get a promise only if you omit the callback."
