      "Is there full fletched promise support in the Node driver as of now? Looking over the docs, there's plenty of asynchronous commands that document supporting callbacks, but not promises (thenable/awaitables). For example `dbDrop`,`dbList` etc.\r\n\r\nbtw, am loving what you're doing with Rethink!"
