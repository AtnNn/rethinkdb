      "@goatic Note that all ReQL terms such as `dbDrop`, `dbList` etc. are non-blocking functions in JavaScript that only build up a \"query object\". The command that actually executes the query and that is blocking is `run`, which has both a promise- and a callback-style interface (which is documented). The examples in the individual commands are often using the callback-style I think."
