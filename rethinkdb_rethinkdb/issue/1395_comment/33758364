      "@pilwon -- I have a couple of questions about this.\r\n\r\n> I also tried rql-promise but what I concluded was it's the cleanest and the easiest to just add this to the official driver\r\n\r\nCould you give some more details about why that is? Why would it be cleaner/better than using rql-promise (or one of the other wrappers like it)?\r\n\r\n> one way would be to add support for both, like some other projects do, and give users an option.\r\n\r\nCould you give an example of a project or two that offer both and do it well? Mixing the two seems hard to do cleanly."
