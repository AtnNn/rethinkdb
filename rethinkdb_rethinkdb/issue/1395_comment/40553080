      "You can do that for now\r\n\r\n```\r\nquery = r.expr(1);\r\nr.connect({port: 42935}).bind(query).then(query.run).then(console.log);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't close the connection. We could remove the need for `bind`if we were fixing https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1966\r\nClosing the connection make things less nice since you have to manually create a function.\r\n\r\nAbout @atnnn's suggestion, it feels kind of wrong to me because things are in the \"wrong order\". But I may be wrong, I'll google a few things to see if people are comfortable with this pattern."
