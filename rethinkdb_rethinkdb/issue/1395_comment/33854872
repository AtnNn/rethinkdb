      "@coffeemug If that's possible with the current driver code, then I absolutely agree.\r\n\r\nI also hope to see `rethinkdbdash`'s connection pool feature be brought in as well to make the official driver easier to use. That leaves only optional callback parameter to `run` (`run(cb)` for callback, `run()` for promise)"
