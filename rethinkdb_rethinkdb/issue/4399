        "When i try use max/min/avg in rethinkdb data explorer everything is working just fine\n\n``` javascript\nr.db('test').table('items').max({index: 'id'})\nOk!\n```\n\nHowever, when I run this with rethinkdbdash i got the following error:\n\n``` javascript\nRqlRuntimeError: Expected type STRING but found OBJECT in\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"items\").max({index: \"id\"})\n```\n\nThis lead me to try following in data explorer:\n\n``` javascript\nr.db('test').table('items').max(r.expr({index: 'id'}))\n\nFAILED\nRqlRuntimeError: Expected type STRING but found OBJECT in\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"items\").max({index: \"id\"})\n```\n\nFrom what i can see, the bug is not in rethinkdbdash. I base this mostly on the error I get while running r.expr in the data explorer but I could be wrong. \n\nThe performance gains in using max with index is huge so i really like this feature, current workaround is using the official rethinkdb driver.\n\nThank you!\n"
