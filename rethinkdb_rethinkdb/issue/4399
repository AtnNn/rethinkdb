        "When i try use max/min/avg in rethinkdb data explorer everything is working just fine\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.db('test').table('items').max({index: 'id'})\r\nOk!\r\n```\r\nHowever, when I run this with rethinkdbdash i got the following error:\r\n```javascript\r\nRqlRuntimeError: Expected type STRING but found OBJECT in\r\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"items\").max({index: \"id\"})\r\n```\r\nThis lead me to try following in data explorer:\r\n```javascript\r\nr.db('test').table('items').max(r.expr({index: 'id'}))\r\n\r\nFAILED\r\nRqlRuntimeError: Expected type STRING but found OBJECT in\r\nr.db(\"test\").table(\"items\").max({index: \"id\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom what i can see, the bug is not in rethinkdbdash. I base this mostly on the error I get while running r.expr in the data explorer but I could be wrong. \r\n\r\nThe performance gains in using max with index is huge so i really like this feature, current workaround is using the official rethinkdb driver.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
