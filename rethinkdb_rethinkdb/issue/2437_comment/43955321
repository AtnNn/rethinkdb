      "> Wait, I don't understand why that's the case. Could you explain why that's happening?\r\n\r\nThe driver always keep a buffer with one element for `hasNext` to be synchronous.\r\n\r\nConsider the situation where the driver received a \"SUCCESS_PARTIAL\" and has only one element in the buffer.\r\nIf you call next on it, it will execute the callback only in one of these cases:\r\n  - the server send back `SUCCESS_SEQUENCE` (that can contain no documents)\r\n  - the server send back more documents\r\n\r\nIf it was not waiting for another response for the server, its buffer will be empty, and it won't be able to know if there are more documents or not (since the server could send back `SUCCESS_SEQUENCE` with no document)."
