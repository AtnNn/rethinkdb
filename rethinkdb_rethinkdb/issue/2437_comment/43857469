      "> You mean a third argument?\r\n\r\nYeah, although I don't really like that.\r\n\r\n> It can just hold off on passing a cursor to the callback until it gets at least one document from the server.\r\n\r\nWe could do that, but that would be quite bad in interactive use, especially when we add a shell. I want to be able to say `cursor = yield r.table('foo').run()` (or `cursor = yield r.table('foo').changes().run()`) and immediately get the cursor without waiting.\r\n\r\nI think dropping `hasNext` for this is ok. It's a bad abstraction anyway."
