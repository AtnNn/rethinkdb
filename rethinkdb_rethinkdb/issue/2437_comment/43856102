      "I'm starting to think the whole synchronous `hasNext` business was a mistake. It never quite fit well, and is doubly so now. What if we dropped `hasNext` in the JS driver entirely? Another alternative is to pass a `more` flag to `next` so users don't have to check the exception. What do you think of these options?"
