      "I see `r.count`, `r.avg`, `r.sum` as the core of a library of aggregation functions. In the next versions we should look into a way to make it easier for people to extend this library (and deploy it). Transforming these functions into ReQL would basically mean closing a possible extension point (and moving the responsibility of developing new functions on us).\r\n\r\nTo make this clearer we could provide them as part of a different namespace."
