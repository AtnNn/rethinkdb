      "After further investigation, the problem appears to be a missing `on_empty_range` in the mock store's `send_backfill()` implementation.\r\nRemaining steps:\r\n* Document the issue properly, to make this easier to figure out in the future, and to stop us from making the same mistake again\r\n* Double-check that the btree-backed store behaves correctly\r\n* Check if we can add any verification steps to catch such problems in the future"
