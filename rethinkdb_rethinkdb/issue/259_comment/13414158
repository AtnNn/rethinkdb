      "@coffeemug while you check the history, could you also take a look at the solution I just pushed.  It's the solution your proposed (or almost?).\r\n\r\nThe reason behind the new behavior is to balance these two ideas:\r\n- Do not overlaps the buttons if possible\r\n- Try to move the arrow and not the tooltip if possible so users can read the description while typing.\r\n\r\nSo the new behavior is defined by:\r\n- If the tooltip is not overlapping the buttons, we have the same behavior.\r\n- If the tooltip overlaps the button, we'll try to fix the tooltip and just move the arrow as much as we can.\r\n- If the tooltip has to overlap a button, the tooltip will stick to the right (so it's going to overlap all buttons). It simulates a shift of 150px (normal shifts are about 200px).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's also on branch michel_206."
