      "I don't completely understand when this becomes an issue. The suggestion box covers the buttons when you're in the middle of typing a query (meaning, when you wouldn't want to hit \"Execute\"). When the query is done (i.e. you've appended `.run()`), you shouldn't see the suggestion box. Is something else happening here, or am I misunderstanding the behavior?"
