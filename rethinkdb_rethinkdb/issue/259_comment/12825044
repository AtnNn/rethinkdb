      "ESC and Shift+Enter are great. \r\n\r\nAvoiding having to hit ESC at all seems more elegant :)\r\n\r\nA solution for this would be to try and ensure that the popup aligns as left as possible to the screen. This way it only becomes an issue when it prompts you for a suggestion when your typed query falls into the region above the buttons.\r\n\r\nSimpler still would be to move the buttons above the query input box or stack the button in a vertical column at the end of the query input box."
