      "@charl, you can execute the query hitting Shift+Enter. So you don't even have to click anywhere.\r\nI guess it's also a doc issue since it's written no where that you can execute query with Shift+Enter.\r\nI'll write a little faq/doc to explain all the things you can do with the data explorer (sometime next week).\r\n\r\nI don't have a good solution if the user really want to click on the execute button. I can whether\r\n- hide the end of the suggestion, which can be frustrating too.\r\n- move the buttons, but we had that at the first prototype of the data explorer, and it was awful.\r\n\r\nIt's also related to issue #190. Hitting ESC to hide the suggestion is available in the branch next if you build form source. If you are using the package from launchpad, it should be available on the next release.\r\n\r\n@charl, thank you for the feedback : )"
