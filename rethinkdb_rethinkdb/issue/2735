        "Reported by @wojons:\r\nHe had a node that used to be a secondary for a table. He then made it the primary (by changing the primary data center through the web UI).\r\nHowever the table remained unavailable, even after a while.\r\n@wojons reports that the node showed high load values of 30-40 during this.\r\nHe eventually restarted the node, and it started backfilling the table (which suggests that it had never completed the secondary->primary switch). After the backfilling it became the primary and everything worked again.\r\n\r\n\r\nA load value of 30-40 with RethinkDB typically means lots of i/o, rather than CPU exhaustion. This makes me think that the node might not have been completely stuck, but rather performing some lengthy process in the background. However a switch from secondary to primary should be much faster than this. We should investigate."
