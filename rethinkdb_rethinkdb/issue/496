        "Right now we can't use anything in the C++11 library, which means we can't really use rvalue references because std::move and std::forward are unavailable.\n\nThis is because on OS X, specifying -stdlib=libc++ results in linking problems with libraries compiled with libstdc++.  We need to hack some homebrew dependencies for protobuf and whatever else we depend on to compile with libc++.\n\nThis is a very high priority because fixing a lot of basic performance problems in the query language code and elsewhere would be much easier with rvalue references, and std::move and std::forward.\n"
