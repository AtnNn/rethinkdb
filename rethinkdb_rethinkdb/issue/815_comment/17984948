      "I'm not certain (I'll do some reading), but at the very least it's sensible to have @anatol sign our CLA just to be on the safe side (since it's non-specific about contributions). This helps us protect the project from future licensing concerns-- most open source projects have a similar system in place.\r\n\r\nAlso, we'd love to send @anatol a gift for helping us get the Arch package together (and fixing this issue). :smile: "
