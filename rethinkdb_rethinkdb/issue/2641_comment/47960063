      "Calling `JSON.stringify` on the query object takes about 200ms out of 1.7 seconds to build and send everything (for 10 objects with 20k fields each).\r\n\r\nI'll first fix `MakeObject`, and see what happens.\r\n\r\nI also don't think the driver should automatically split the data to insert. This is more what an import tool should do (and I believe this is what `rethinkdb-import` is currently doing).\r\n\r\nAt least we shouldn't change the behavior or `insert` (or it's going to create tons of strange cases). We could add an `import` command though."
