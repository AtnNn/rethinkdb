      "Inserting such a document with some other driver takes ~100ms, which is not ridiculously unreasonable for a document of half a MB. Though we need more detailed measurements about what the bottleneck there is (first of all: how much of that is server time?).\r\n\r\nIn some cases `r.json(JSON.stringify(x))` still seems to be faster than transmitting the document directly, though that might not be true for the JavaScript driver. That part needs investigation."
