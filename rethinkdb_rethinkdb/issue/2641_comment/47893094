      "If the data that's passed in is an array and calling stringify on the entire thing makes the stringifier blow up, you could split the array (since they are seperate documents) and send it in multiple chunks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is how I'm currently getting around doing a bulk insert of 6 million documents, which would otherwise make stringifier error out for giving it too much data.\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Jul 3, 2014 at 4:03 AM, Slava Akhmechet <notifications@github.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Thanks @neumino -- I didn't realize we dropped the `r.json` in `insert`. The user observed that jsonify blows up his machine -- is that because we call it in the driver to create the json string we use to send over to the server?\r\n> It's possible that there isn't much we can do here (beyond what you mentioned about `MakeObject`).\r\n> ---\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n> https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2641#issuecomment-47877901"
