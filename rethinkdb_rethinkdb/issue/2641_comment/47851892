      "I think we stopped translating inserts to `insert(r.json(...))` when we moved to the JSON protocol (or at least the Ruby driver did), because we were no longer encoding large protobufs, which meant it was no longer slow.\r\n\r\nIf `r.json()` is faster in the JS driver, there's probably a more efficient way for it to be doing things."
