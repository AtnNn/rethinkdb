      "Thanks @neumino -- I didn't realize we dropped the `r.json` in `insert`. The user observed that jsonify blows up his machine -- is that because we call it in the driver to create the json string we use to send over to the server?\r\n\r\nIt's possible that there isn't much we can do here (beyond what you mentioned about `MakeObject`).\r\n\r\n"
