      "Inserting a single such document with the JavaScript driver takes ~330ms. Wrapping it into `r.json(JSON.stringify(doc))` reduces the insert time to 140 ms.\r\nWe don't appear to automatically do that on a per-insert level anymore in the 1.13 driver?\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the inefficiency without `r.json()` is still on the server side."
