      "I think that's the exact opposite of the behavior we want.  Let's say you do `r(SOME_ARRAY).group('a')` -- you get back GROUPED_DATA, where the data are arrays.  We want `r(SOME_ARRAY).group('a').count` to call count *on those arrays*, not count the number of groups, because that's what `tbl.group('a').count` does.\r\n\r\n95% of the time what you want to do is operate on the content of the groups."
