      "That line was touched in d9381b581865123b1039381c0756edb445bafa5b, but the new behavior is theoretically equivalent to the old behavior.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the problem is that a peer is appearing in the directory even though the `connectivity_cluster_t` thinks it isn't connected. This is probably a race condition; `auto_reconnector_t` is assuming that the directory metadata propagates instantaneously, which isn't necessarily true."
