        "I ran the following tests using the Python driver:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef timeit(l):\r\n    a = time.time()\r\n    l()\r\n    print(\"{}\".format(time.time() - a))\r\n\r\ndocs = [ { 'val': i, 'count': 8, 'data': [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] * 20 } for i in range(10000) ]\r\n\r\ntimeit(lambda: json.loads(json.dumps(docs)))\r\n=> 0.415936946869\r\n\r\ntimeit(lambda: r.json(json.dumps(docs)).do(lambda x: 1).run())\r\n=> 101.72\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I look at `top` output during this process, the client is done almost instantaneously, but the server is stuck with 100% CPU utilization for over a hundred seconds. My suspicion is that the problem is in json parsing, or datum construction, or some such.\r\n\r\nThis was encountered by a user (https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/6444786#comment-900775) so it's something we should fix."
