      "I removed the help pager entirely, so that really shouldn't be a problem anymore.  However, the control characters are certainly still there, I did nothing to change that.  As far as I remember, control characters for bold and underline are used, but only on help commands.  I don't know if there's an easy way to detect the terminal capabilities to filter those out, or we could just remove them entirely (though I think that would hurt the general use case)."
