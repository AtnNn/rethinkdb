        "1. Start a cluster of two rethinkdb nodes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrdb1$ rethinkdb\r\nrdb2$ rethinkdb --port-offset 1 -j localhost:29015\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Go to data explorer, create a table, and insert a bunch of documents (I magically inserted 512).\r\n\r\n3. Go to the table view, set the number of replicas to 2. When the replication completes, set the number of shards to 2.\r\n\r\n4. Kill one of the rethinkdb nodes.\r\n\r\n5. Resolve the pending issue by declaring the machine dead. There will be another issue (about too many replicas). Don't click the \"manually resolve\" button. Instead, just change the replica count to one.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: 'servers used by this table' view should reflect the changes made (e.g. show a single machine with two shards).\r\nObserved behavior:  'servers used by this table' view doesn't update until the user refreshes the whole browser.\r\n\r\nThis bug looks complex to reproduce by reading, but is actually pretty easy to accidentally run into. I'm happy to demo it if necessary."
