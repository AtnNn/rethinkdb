      "I also prefer having `new_val` and no `old_val` to indicate that the server is sending the initial value. That works *really* well because you don't have to branch out in the handling code and access a different field in different circumstances. I think just dropping `old_val` is the best option.\r\n\r\n(Also, don't call me Slava, call me @coffeemug -- this way I get notifications on the issue)"
