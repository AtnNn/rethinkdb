      "Yeah I have to agree that the current format in this case is not ideal.\r\nI think both `{new_val: x}` or `{initial_val: x}` would work well. I probably slightly prefer `{initial_val: x}` because it's more explicit and might make handling the results returned by a change feed with initial values easier. In cases where initial and values that are added later must be distinguished (e.g. later changes will generate a notification or something), `{new_val: x}` is more annoying because you have to check whether the `old_val` field doesn't exists or is `nil` in order to distinguish both cases."
