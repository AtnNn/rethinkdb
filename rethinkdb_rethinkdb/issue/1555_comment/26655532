      "I think I'm the one in charge of the JS driver.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this bug, I don't think it's related to how we do optargs.\r\nIt's just a bug in `ast.coffee` line 219. We check if the second argument is an object with `instanceof Object` instead of calling `Object.prototype.toString`, and since an array is an instance of Object, we get the current bug.\r\n\r\nI have a fix that seems to work. I'll add some tests on Monday before pushing it."
