      "There is no one person officially responsible for the Javascript driver, but most fixes have been done by @neumino and @atnnn, so Javascript bugs should be redirected to them.\r\n\r\n> I have a fix that seems to work. I'll add some tests on Monday before pushing it.\r\n\r\nJust a friendly reminder, please observe the standard code review process for the JS driver."
