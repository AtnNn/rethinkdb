      "A big advantage of this is that we wouldn't rely on multiple subsequent HTTP connections to get routed to the same RethinkDB server.\r\n\r\nIf you have a proxy in front of a RethinkDB cluster and want to do round-robin load balancing, our current protocol is unable to deal with that since it relies on multiple connections to reach the same server."
