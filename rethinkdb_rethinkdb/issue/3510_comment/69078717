      "@joaojeronimo Thanks for the suggestion and link.\r\nI think part of @deontologician 's goal is to make the protocol used by the web UI to connect to the server more similar to the protocol we use for regular clients. With websockets we might need less specialized code in the JavaScript driver for dealing with tunnelling our protocol over HTTP connections. My feeling is that server sent events would actually be further away from our regular client protocol, which is generally based on request/response pairs.\r\nNonetheless it might still make sense for the special case of changefeeds if there are other benefits."
