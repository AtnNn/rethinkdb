      "The update period is currently one second, which means that the latest duration that's visible on the changefeed can be about a second off, as you noticed.\r\n\r\nWe're planning to make the update time configurable through the `squash` parameter. This is tracked in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3429 . I'm going to bump that issue, though it will probably still take us 1-2 releases until we get the functionality in."
