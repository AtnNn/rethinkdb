      "@jergason -- that's a really interesting suggestion, thanks!\r\n\r\nThe `jobs` table currently samples the queries, so the information is approximate. This isn't a problem for really long-running queries (as you pointed out), but it doesn't work ideally for faster queries. One potential problem with your suggestion is that if the system has tens of thousands of queries, always updating the stats when each query finishes could result in a non-trivial performance hit. We should look into it, though -- there may be a way for us to do this efficiently but I'm not sure off the top of my head."
