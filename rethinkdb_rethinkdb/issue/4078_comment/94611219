      "I see, thanks for the suggestion @sreejaThummala!\r\n\r\nI don't think we'll get to this in the next couple releases, but we'll keep it in mind.\r\n\r\nThere's also the question of how different index data structures will integrate into the ReQL query layer. Currently ReQL terms assume a certain type of index where keys are ordered sequentially. It might need a pretty major rewrite to take advantage of other index types (say a multi-dimensional index for example). "
