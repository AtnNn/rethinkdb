      "Just needed this again when debugging something that a user ran into.\r\nIt turns out @Tryneus had actually already implemented a `print_source()` method on `func_t`, so I just went ahead and hooked that into `index_status()`.\r\n\r\nThe output isn't perfect, but I think it's worth shipping this even if we later redo it in a nicer way.  Sorry for not adhering to the ReQL_proposal standards, but I think the absence of this feature is sufficiently annoying for debugging that we should just ship it.\r\n\r\nThe `indexStatus()` output looks like this (note the new `source` field):\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    \"function\": <binary, 127 bytes, \"24 72 65 71 6c 5f...\"> ,\r\n    \"geo\": false ,\r\n    \"index\": \"parent_folder_id\" ,\r\n    \"multi\": false ,\r\n    \"outdated\": true ,\r\n    \"ready\": true ,\r\n    \"source\": 'function (captures = [(no implicit)]) (args = [1]) var1(\"data\")(\"parent_folder_id\")'\r\n}\r\n```"
