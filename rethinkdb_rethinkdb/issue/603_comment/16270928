      "I'm choosing to reinterpret this issue in the following manner. While we check argument counts for the actual RQL API functions we do not for the \"infrastructure\" methods defined on connection and cursor. I'll make a pass and make sure that all user facing methods check their arguments so we don't get any more errors like this."
