        "A few of us have had odd problems that were traced back to the `.gitattributes` addition recently. We should probably figure out exactly what is happen and work to mitigate those problems. One example was the first section of #5595.\n\nFor those who might be directed her to fix temporary problems, here is the workaround, do this from the root of the repository:\n1.  `echo \"\" > ./.gitattributes` to wipe away the settings (temporarily)\n2. `git checkout` everything that is having this problem\n3. `git checkout .gitattributes` again to re-set it\n"
