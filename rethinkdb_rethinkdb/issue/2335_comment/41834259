      "I've already set up a similar scenario by the way (for benchmarking). Haven't seen any crashes so far with up to 2000 clients (though only coming in from two machines).\r\nI'll try more...\r\n\r\n@nviennot: If you are interested: I could get ~4K writes/s on a single node by the way (with 1000 clients), which is a bit faster but in the same ballpark as the 2.5K you've measured. The difference might be due to different i/o systems (I actually used two local SSDs in a RAID 0) and no virtualization as on EC2.\r\nRethinkDB next (i.e. what's going to become 1.13) is a bit faster than 1.12, but not by that much.\r\nI got about 9.2K writes/s with three nodes, so again that's in a similar ballpark as your numbers."
