      "On EC2:\r\n- 3 RethinkDB v1.12.4 instances on c3.8xlarge, the data dir is mounted on a regular ext4 partition on SSDs.\r\n- Two tables, posts and comments, with 3 shards each, no secondary indexes.\r\n- 400 clients machines on c3.large, each trying to insert post and comment documents (~150 bytes each) one by one (not in bulk).\r\n\r\nIt crashes even with 50 or clients.\r\n\r\nI'm doing some benchmark, but I think I'll have to forfeit on the sharding setup.\r\nOn a single node setup, I'm getting peek performances at ~2500 writes/s which is really low in my opinion."
