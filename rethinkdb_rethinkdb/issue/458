Therefore both of the following fail:\n\n```\nrethinkdb create --directory servers/server_1\n=> Error directory servers/ doesn't exist\nmkdir -p servers/server_1\nrethinkdb create --directory servers/server_1\n=> Error directory server_1 already exists\n```\n\nThis is confusing. I feel like I should be able to do both and not be forced to create just the parent directories.\n"
