      "It is relatively easy to handle multiple threads on Python using (`threading.local`)[https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html#threading.local]. I even had a driver hacked up to provide every thread its own sockets a while ago. That was not really production ready since it did nothing to protect the access to cursors, but adding that would not have been too much work. So making connections thread-safe would not be too difficult, and probably would not introduce much additional latency.\r\n\r\nGiven that I am not a huge fan of putting in an error for wrong-thread access, but it would be easy to do and is better than the minefield we currently have.\r\n\r\nNote that I don't know what effects the `Tornado` code might have on this conversation."
