      "I don't understand what this issue is about exactly. @coffeemug or @mlucy can you explain this?\r\n\r\nIf you pass a single argument to `get_all`, the `order_by` after that with the same index would be a no-op since all documents returned by the `get_all` have the same index value.\r\n\r\nIs this about ordering the result of a variadic `get_all` then? \r\nIf that's the case, an alternative would be to add a guarantee that `get_all` returns its results in the same order that its arguments are given in. Then one can call `order_by` on its arguments to get the same effect.\r\nAlso I'm wondering if we can actually use the index for ordering the way `get_all` is currently implemented. Isn't it sending an inependent get for each of its argument?"
