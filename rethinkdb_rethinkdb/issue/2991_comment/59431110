      "Thanks for the explanation @coffeemug . The only issue I take with that is that ordering a variadic `get_all` with an index isn't actually going to use the index (presumably). So that operation would be slower than users expect.\r\nThe difference is only a logarithmic factor though, and in contrast to non-indexed `order_by()` on a table there is no additional memory overhead here in adding the `order_by`, since all the arguments to a variadic `get_all()` must already be in memory anyway. So it seems like that would be fine."
