      "> Is this about ordering the result of a variadic `get_all` then? \r\n\r\nYes, but it's also about the UI convenience that the user should be able to say `.get('foo', index='bar').orderBy(index='bar')` and not get an error (I know that particular case would be a noop, but it's we still shouldn't error in that case).\r\n\r\n> If that's the case, an alternative would be to add a guarantee that `get_all` returns its results in the same order that its arguments are given in. Then one can call `order_by` on its arguments to get the same effect.\r\n\r\nYep, but we still have to do that, and chaining `.order_by` with the same index shouldn't error."
