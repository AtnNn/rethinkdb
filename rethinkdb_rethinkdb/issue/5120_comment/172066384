      "Just playing around at this point using react-router and redux, but I'm working on a collaborative markdown editor in which the index page is a generic splash page and then when the user clicks \"create new\" a unique instance is created at `index/editor/:uniqueid`. The markdown glob is then stored in rethinkdb (indexed using the same id). \r\n\r\nI have it wired up with socket.io right now so that after the user stops typing for three seconds, an autosave is triggered (but not sure I'll be able to do that after switching to an ajax-type model).."
