        "One thing that i love about sql databases is so many settings to play with. I know there are some werid limits in rethinkdb and it would be nice to get more settings that the user can adjust there settings for things maybe they want more corutines per thread or when backfill throttle comes in to place just everything that can be a setting make it a setting i am sure \"devs know best\" but sometimes users end up in werid states and its hard to make settings that make everyone happy but allowing overrides can make everyone happy."
