        "Hi all,\n\nThis is a new issue in 1.14 as far as I can tell.\n\nWhen working with large-ish queries in the data explorer, selection within the textarea becomes completely unresponsive to selections in Firefox 32.0 on the Mac.\n\nHere's a demonstration:\n\n![bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/44855/4252180/b3bb11d0-3a93-11e4-9206-84e3856611cf.gif)\n\nBasically I can't 'unselect' (I didn't even 'select'), breaking query editing entirely. Behavior doesn't seem reproducible on Chrome.\n\nThe query I'm using [can be found here](https://gist.github.com/chrisvariety/787dce5491485c8345dd), but any large query seems to trigger this -- haven't quite figured out the trigger point.\n"
