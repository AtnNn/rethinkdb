      "There is still one thing unclear to me regarding how such complex queries with lambas inside can be executed without using JS server-side...\r\n\r\nBasically this query has 3 anonymous nested functions and I don't see a way how this can be executed without interpreting JS inside, and if this is the case this can hit performance if done each time the record is being passed thru those `.map()` functions\r\n\r\nWould appreciate any insight"
