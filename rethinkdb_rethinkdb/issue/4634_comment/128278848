      "@let4be While you write these functions as JS lambda functions (or Python lambda functions, or Ruby lambda functions etc. depending on which driver you're using), they are translated into a ReQL function in the driver and then send to the server. No JavaScript code is ever sent to the server, unless you use `r.js`.\r\nhttp://rethinkdb.com/blog/lambda-functions/ has an explanation of the process."
