        "Was running r.branch() inside of a r.expr like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.expr([r.branch(), r.branch(), r.branch()])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was doing this because if i tried to send one at a time it would run at about 1-2 a second. the r.batch were pretty much the follwoing.\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.brabch(\r\n    r.table().get(),\r\n    r.table().get().update({'array' : r.row('arraay').append('sub obj)}),\r\n    r.table().get().insert('new obj')\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf i sent this in the r.epr i was able to get upto 10/sec and min 6/sec which seems really slow because if i just write all of them at once as there own line it takes about 1 second to write 500 or so.\r\n\r\nIf you run normal r.insert() i can get about 100/sec i guess thats related to #230 so a few things i am thinkking even tho r.batch is really cool if i wanna write on anotehr table and some other things there should be a simple way when doing update where its a lot like upsert. able to branch inside of it and not have to call the doc again. its kinda like upsert if exists run this command if it does not exist sort of idea."
