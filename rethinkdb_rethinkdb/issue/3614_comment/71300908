      "@YChebotaev Yes, I meant the error message that we print is too unspecific. It just says \"cannot open or find log file\" but doesn't say why.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB actually does create the log file if it doesn't exist, but it cannot if it doesn't have the permissions to do so.\r\n\r\nThinking about this again, I think you are right that we should change the behavior of RethinkDB itself as well. Specifically when telling RethinkDB to run as a certain user through `--runuser`, I think it should make sure that the log file exists and has the right permissions *before* dropping root privileges.\r\nReopening for that."
