      "Hi @YChebotaev , can you check that the rethinkdb user has read and write permissions to both\r\n`/var/lib/rethinkdb/local` and `/var/log/rethinkdb.local.log`? This would be my first guess as to what might go wrong here.\r\n\r\nAre you starting RethinkDB with the init script? If yes, could you post your complete instance configuration from `/etc/rethinkdb/instances.d` ? Otherwise, could you post all command line flags that you are using when starting RethinkDB?"
