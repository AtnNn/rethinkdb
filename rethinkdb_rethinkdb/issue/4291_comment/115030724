      "As of bbed1b3adf13a6a742d1de9034e51016240a3105 this takes about 3 seconds of CPU time to do a complete reconfiguration of a 64-shard table on SSDs. (Rotational drive performance is still dismal; that's tracked in #4279.) The `shard_fuzzer.py` test is still failing until branch history GC is merged, so I'll leave this open for now."
