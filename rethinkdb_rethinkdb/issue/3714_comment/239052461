      "Is there a standard way, on the consumer side, to convert this feed of old_pos, new_pos into the final array a user would want to display?\r\n\r\nI guess another way of asking this is the following question: For r.table().order_by().limit(10).changes(), I'd like to use a callback that takes the final updated array, not individual (each()) elements.\r\n\r\nI'm just asking because I imagine lots of people are doing this, and maybe there's a function or a separate NPM module that makes it easy to coalesce into a result array."
