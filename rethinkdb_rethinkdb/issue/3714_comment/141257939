      "@dalanmiller also mentioned that it would be nice if we could support this for unlimited `orderBy` changefeeds (e.g. `r.table(...).orderBy({index: ...}).changes()`.\r\nIt sounds like it wouldn't easily work with our current implementation of those, and I can't see an obvious way of doing it without a lot of memory overhead. But we should think about it a bit."
