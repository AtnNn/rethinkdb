      "For ordered feeds, we could maybe squash only the last change? I'm actually fine not squashing things in a first time.\r\n\r\n@timmaxw -- why would be impractical to compute the old and new positions? Isn't that \"just\" about keeping a number of children on each node of the tree?\r\nWhile it requires more updates on the tree, it would also make things like `orderBy(...).skip(x).limit(y)` more efficient no?"
