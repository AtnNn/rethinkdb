      "Ok, so it appears that:\r\n\r\n- Humans want names\r\n- Bots want uuids\r\n- Exposing both names and uuids in a single document sucks for a variety of reasons\r\n- Exposing multiple name-tables and uuid-tables that do basically the same thing sucks for obvious reasons\r\n\r\nWhat if we added an optarg to `run`, say `refer_by`, with possible options being `'name'` (default) and `'uuid'`? We'd use this optarg when the user queries system tables and ignore it elsewhere. (Eventually, we might find ourselves using it in other places too) I think this is as close as we can get to the best of both worlds, as it seems both pretty elegant and nice to use."
