      "@larkost: The most common way that the user will write to `table_config` is to replace the contents of the `shards` field. So right now, they would run a query something like this:\r\n```python\r\nr.table_config(\"my_table\")\r\n .update({\"shards\": [{\"director\": \"foo\", \"replicas\": [\"foo\", \"bar\"]}]})\r\n```\r\nUnder your proposal, what do you think they could type instead? The only options I can think of that would include the UUID with the name are both verbose and counterintuitive."
