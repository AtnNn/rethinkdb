      "I would suggest not accepting UUIDs in commands for v1 (and possibly forever). The `identifier_format` optarg to `run` is consistent with other `*_format` optargs and implies that it changes the behavior of printing, not of accepting a different mode of arguments. It's not clear that we actually *need* the functionality of accepting UUIDs in commands, so I don't think we should do that for now. If the need arises, we can revisit this, but I don't think there is a compelling reason to do it for v1 (or until we see a good reason later, which we may not)."
