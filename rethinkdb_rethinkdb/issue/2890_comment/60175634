      "@larkost and I just talked in person. I thought he was talking about letting people refer to servers by UUID in `shards`, but he was actually talking about exposing the table's UUID in the `table_config` document, which we already do. (It acts like an autogenerated primary key; writing to it causes an error.) So there is no disagreement."
