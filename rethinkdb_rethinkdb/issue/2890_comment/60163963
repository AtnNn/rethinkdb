      "@deontologician ran into this problem; he has a server's UUID and wants an easy way to find all the tables that server is responsible for, even if there is another server with the same name. One way to fix this would be to expose UUIDs alongside names in `rethinkdb.table_status`.\r\n\r\nThe idea of exposing UUIDs alongside names doesn't work for `rethinkdb.table_config` because the fields are supposed to be writable, so the user would have to keep them in sync, and that's just ugly. But we could offer a parallel table `rethinkdb.table_config_with_servers_identified_by_uuid` (obviously a bad name) that was also writable but was in terms of UUIDs."
