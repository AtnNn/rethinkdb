      "@timmaxw and I spent a lot of time trying to eliminate uuid/name duality, but it turns out to be extremely tricky in a distributed system for a thousand small reasons that add up very quickly. So I think we're stuck with this (and it's not *that* bad).\r\n\r\nI think that for v1 `refer_by: 'name/uuid'` should only modify the printing behavior in the system tables, not behavior of commands and what they accept. It's not ideal, but is easier, requires less changes, and I think for v1 it's more than good enough. We can see how people use it/what happens and then see if it's worth extending the option to also encompass other commands."
