      "If we do go down the route that @coffeemug posits, then it would probably be a good idea to accept `name` and `uuid` interchangeably in these places. We are already going to have to disambiguate `name` for the (rare) case where we have conflicts, so there is already going to be a function to encapsulate this logic in."
