      "You correctly understood what I was saying for `table_drop()` and `db_drop()`. But I do have some other objections to allowing UUIDs there. For one thing, it would be inconsistent with `table_create()` and `db_create()`. For another thing, there are a lot of other commands that could conceivably accept and return UUIDs: `r.db()`, `r.table_status()`, `r.table_config()`, `r.db_config()`, `r.db_list()`, `r.table_list()`, etc. I'd rather have `r.table()` be a special case than add support to all of those commands.\r\n\r\nEdit: ~~We could even consider something like `r.table(uuid, identifier_format=\"uuid\")`.~~ Actually, that's a horrible idea."
