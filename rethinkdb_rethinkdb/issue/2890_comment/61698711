      "I'm not sure I fully understand your argument regarding `table_drop()` and `db_drop()`. You mean that if you want to delete a table/db by uuid, you can already do it by deleting from `table_config` / `db_config` and hence allowing UUIDs in `table_drop()`/`db_drop()` isn't really required to get this functionality?\r\n\r\nI definitely think we should make the commands consistent though. It seems `r.table(uuid)` should work for the reasons you mention. Therefore I think `table_drop(uuid)` and `db_drop(uuid)` should work as well."
