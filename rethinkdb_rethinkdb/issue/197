I'd love to see support for dot notation. \r\n\r\ne.g. with a table containing the following document:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  name: 'Me',\r\n  address: {\r\n    street: '10 Downing',\r\n    city: 'London'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to do:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndb.table('user').filter({'address.street': '10 Downing'})\r\n```"
