I'd love to see support for dot notation. \n\ne.g. with a table containing the following document:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  name: 'Me',\n  address: {\n    street: '10 Downing',\n    city: 'London'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI'd like to be able to do:\n\n``` javascript\ndb.table('user').filter({'address.street': '10 Downing'})\n```\n"
