      "I'm reluctant to do this for several reasons:\r\n* Step 1 is hard for RethinkDB to do without user assistance. We don't know where they want the data to be moved to.\r\n* If the user doesn't understand what the server removal command is doing under the hood, they can screw it up. For example, they might move a table back to the server that's being removed. We can prevent this by adding a flag on the server that prevents tables from being moved to it. But then we need to implement the flag and give the user a way to see it and manipulate it. (One way to expose it would be as a boolean `being_removed` field in `rethinkdb.server_config`.)\r\n* Retiring a server is a fairly uncommon operation, and the above procedure isn't actually that bad."
