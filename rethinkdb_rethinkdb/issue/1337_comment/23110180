      "Thanks everyone for chiming in - the comments were very helpful! I\8217m very busy at the moment, but trying to dedicate some time to writing the driver. I first started back before the proto spec changed to its current form (and the proto RFC was still hanging around). I\8217m writing a .Net driver. Yes I know there is one already, but that doesn\8217t mean we don\8217t need another :D I\8217m trying to reduce the number of runtime errors by ensuring (as much as possible) that only valid operations are chained together. Thus I\8217m going to be a bit pedantic on the signatures of the methods. \r\n\r\nI\8217ve been trying to reconcile what you\8217ve said with the docs and with what RethingDB is spitting out at me using type_of (thanks!). There are a few nuances which the docs don\8217t take into account. See below for example:\r\n\r\n<b>inner_join</b>\r\n_docs:_\r\nsequence.inner_join(other_sequence, predicate) \8594 stream \r\narray.inner_join(other_sequence, predicate) \8594 array\r\n\r\n_type_of:_\r\ntable,table -> inner_join ->  STREAM\r\ntable,selection -> inner_join ->  STREAM\r\ntable,array -> inner_join ->  STREAM \r\n\r\nselection,table -> inner_join ->  ARRAY\r\nselection,selection -> inner_join ->  ARRAY\r\nselection,array -> inner_join ->  ARRAY\r\n\r\narray,array -> inner_join ->  ARRAY\r\narray,array -> inner_join ->  ARRAY\r\n\r\nHere the issue is that with the first argument of selection, the result maps to array, not stream. Is this a bug in RethinkDb, or in the docs? Should I be taking what the docs say over what the existing drivers are giving me?\r\n"
