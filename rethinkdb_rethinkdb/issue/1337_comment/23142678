      "@flipchart -- it turns out that it actually depends on whether you're doing a `get_all` on the primary key or a secondary index.  In the former case it returns an array (because we have a single value that's loaded into memory), in the latter case it returns a stream (because we have a lazy stream -- you could have arbitrarily many values with the same sindex value).\r\n\r\nThat's a sort of irritating corner case, but I'm not sure what we should do about it."
