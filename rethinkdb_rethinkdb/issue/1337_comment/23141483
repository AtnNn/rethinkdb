      "Awesome! I like the generics of selection and having it be merely an augmented sequence is great. I ran some more tests using a selection from filter vs get_all and the results are indeed different which now makes sense. \r\n\r\nI think that I'm now happy with these types. To recap, sequence is a collection of items. Array and Stream are special types of sequence which have different behavior (around laziness). Selection is a metadata construct which can augment Array, Stream, or Object and supports updating, etc. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, the docs are correct, although having them be more explicit around the type of selection (array vs stream) would be good. get_all is documented to return a selection, but as @mlucy points out, it's always an array selection, so any method you chain will resolve the array overload.
