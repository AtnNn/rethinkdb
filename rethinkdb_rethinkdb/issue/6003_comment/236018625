      "Depending on its configuration, Linux can place things into swap even before all RAM is exhausted. Its behavior can be controlled through the `swappiness` parameter.\r\n\r\nThis answer has a great explanation of how the parameter works and how to configure it: http://askubuntu.com/a/103916/209792\r\n\r\nThe swapping issue is not critical by itself, and you can ignore it. However parts of RethinkDB being in swap can lead to very bad performance behavior in some circumstances, and can cause disconnects (due to heartbeat timeouts) in clusters, which in turn lead to table unavailability."
