They shouldn't be -- we\r\n  should just print proper error messages and return user values. Printing\r\n  Python exceptions and tracebacks is really unfriendly in those cases.\r\n\r\nLink: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2098\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Liu Aleaxander <Aleaxander@gmail.com>"
