      "Thanks... I don't use `do` often enough. Do you know if the `r.branch` or multiple `r.get`s would be more performant? (Does it matter? Should I worry about this stuff? Too used to an everything-is-indexed SQL world...) (Note that `r.filter()` use is just for the example, it is actually a second indexed `getAll`)"
