      "> We should allow noreply writes (and therefore write pipelining)\r\n\r\n>  the user is explicitly ASKING for data to be discarded to increase speed.\r\n\r\nUsers want faster writes and pipelining, but they do not want to ignore errors. Noreply writes is the wrong solution.\r\n\r\nIf users really did not care about write errors, we could simply implement noreply writes by discarding the query."
