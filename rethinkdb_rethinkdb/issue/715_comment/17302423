      "I guess this would mostly be to compare to Mongo in certain configurations.\r\nOn the other hand - leaving apart the questionable significance of such benchmarks - I doubt that RethinkDB would do so well in such a comparison, considering the apparently relatively expensive protocol (#732).\r\n\r\n@jdoliner: To be fair, implementing this kind of checks would be an optional feature for a driver. If it doesn't implement it, it would simply send read queries to the server and don't care. Apart from that, I totally agree with you. Also, nobody likes drivers that try to outsmart the user."
