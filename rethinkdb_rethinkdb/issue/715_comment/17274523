      "Fair enough, I guess you could find out if a query has permanent side effects (= a write of some kind) or not (= it makes no sense to run it in no-reply) by walking over the ast and looking at the terms used.\r\nOf course some heuristics could be implemented more easily, like if the topmost term in the query is a get, get_all, between, filter, pluck etc. the driver considers the query a read... One could then ask the user to rewrite the query and remove any of the \"read-indicator\" terms, in case the query was actually a write but the driver thought it was a read.\r\ne.g. \r\n    r.expr({success: (table(...).insert(...))(\"inserted\").eq(1) })"
