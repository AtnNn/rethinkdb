      "For cases 1 and 2, we need a way to get error messages out. Diagnosing problems will be impossible otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn case 3, we cannot \"find out the speed of the system in the absence of network latency\". With no replies, all we would be measuring is the network bandwidth and the driver, which we can easily benchmark with a dummy server."
