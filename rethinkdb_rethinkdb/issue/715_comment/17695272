      "@mlucy In the tests you wrote, you specified that the user should be able to substitute `nil` for false and any other value for true. The server doesn't actually accept these values, instead insisting on a boolean. Thus it would appear as though the ruby driver is coercing the argument passed to noreply to a boolean.\r\n\r\nEverywhere else we allow the server to define which type conversions are allowed and I think we should stick to that here. For the time being I have *not* implemented this behavior but we should decided what we want to do and ensure consistency before merging this feature.\r\n\r\nThe py and js implementations as well as the fix to the test framework and tests are pushed to branch 715_noreply_writes."
