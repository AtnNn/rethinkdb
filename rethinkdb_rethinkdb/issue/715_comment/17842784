      "I guess the question is whether a correctly working driver can trigger such cases, or if this applies only to faulty drivers. In the latter case I think this would be absolutely acceptable.\r\nThe user will still see an error when they later send another query without noreply over the same connection, as the query token of the response will not be what the driver expects. That error will not be user-friendly of course, but if the driver is at fault, it would be enough to allow driver developers to investigate the case."
