      "Eh I think having type checking logic like this in drivers is a recipe for disaster. We're likely to add more write queries in the future and each of these updates would require driver maintainers to update their code. What if we just said that a no reply query returns a null response immediately if it's a write and returns an error if it's a read. Admittedly this adds in a bit of latency but it's still a big performance boost and it makes the drivers easier to implement.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we could just accept no reply reads and not respond to them. I don't think that's the end of the world either."
