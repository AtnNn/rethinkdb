      "I don't disagree that we need to get error messages out. My assertion is that:\r\n* Getting errors out is a little harder, and until we do that, this feature still has utility, for two reasons.\r\n  * Memcached allows noreply writes in precisely the way they're done here, and people find that feature very useful\r\n  * People *can* get some sense of speed of the system. What they typically try to do is insert ~1M elements with one connection one by one, and then go to the web UI and look at the write count. Then they say \"why is this slower than system X?\" If we have the noreply functionality, we can tell them \"turn this flag on, *these* are the results comparable to system X, here's why, etc.\"\r\n\r\n* Even if noreplys without error callbacks don't have utility (which is an assertion I strongly disagree with), it's still a prerequisite to doing the full thing, so doing it doesn't hurt us."
