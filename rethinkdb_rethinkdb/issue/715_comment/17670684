      "So, the interface I was thinking of is in http://newton:8080/ui#file:review=501/version=22573 , although as @neumino says there's not really any reason to have a callback in javascript, so we should probably get rid of that.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the test driver doesn't support passing arguments to `run` (or at least I don't know how to do it).  I hacked around it in ruby, but Slava opened a bug saying that we should probably extend the test framework to support `run` arguments.  @wmrowan -- would that be an easy change to make?"
