      "Ah; I forgot that that was in there.\r\n\r\nSince we already have facilities for other global optional arguments it seems strange to have a special field for this one (and also like it would be more work for third-party driver developers).  I think we might not have had global optional arguments in the protobuf spec when we added the `noreply` field.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning toward removing the `noreply` field and leaving the `noreply` flag in the global optional arguments.  What do other people think?\r\n\r\nI don't know whether this will make it into 1.5 or not, but I'd like it to.\r\n"
