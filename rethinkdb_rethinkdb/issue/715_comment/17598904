      "Sorry, let me be more precise: say I have a directory `rethinkdb` which is a clone of the rethinkdb repo but with the modified yaml file, along with a separate directory `rethinkdb-www` which is a fresh clone of the rethinkdb-www repo.  What do I type in which directory to get a website I can look at rendering the modified yaml file?"
