      "My question is made partly because the server can apparently, in the branch supposed to fix this, sometimes send a response to noreply operation (basically when the query is seen malformed early enough that we haven't parsed out the noreply parameter).  Edit: And I was wondering if the server could just be made simpler.  But apparently it can't.  Edit 2: Actually apparently it can."
