      "I'll add a feature to the test system that allows you to specify arguments to `.run`.\r\n\r\n@mlucy and I talked about it and like the idea of making the callback optional if you specify noreply. If you do choose to supply it then we call the callback as soon as the query has been sent off. This way we don't break any control flow schemes that supply a generic continuation to all queries (a technique our own test framework uses)."
