      "Sending no response to a query is a very bad idea. We would start writing applications, benchmarks and tests that run faster, but they would be impossible to debug and would fail silently.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB should at least send back an asynchronous response to the driver to tell it that the query is finished and what the error was, if any.\r\n\r\nThe drivers could allow you to write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nx = table.insert(big).run(conn, noreply=true)\r\nx.async_error_handler(lambda e: raise e)\r\nx.wait_for_completion()\r\n```"
