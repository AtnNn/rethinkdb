        "Currently if you want to build any of the drivers you have to also have run `./configure`. For Python and Ruby this is not really necessary, since they need no downloads, and there are no settings for them. There is a longer conversation to be had about the JavaScript driver (it needs a CoffeScript compiler and all its decencies), and some thinking to be done about the Java driver (obviously needs a Java compiler).\n\nIn addition to making people jump though possibly unneeded hoops if they want to work on the drivers, this also makes testing on 10.7 difficult, since we no longer support the compiler there, but still need to build the drivers to test.\n"
