        "When external modules get build (e.g.: v8, libcurl, etc...) they are not getting the CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS, or CFLAGS that the rest of the build is getting. That seems wrong to me for items that are going to be linked in to our binary. For example on MacOS we are setting `-stdlib=libc++`, and it would probably be bad if anything were to be compiled with a different C++ standard library."
