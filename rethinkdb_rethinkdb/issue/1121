        "We've had many problems with broken backtrace pretty printing (see #973). Ultimately, this is because we don't have anyway of testing pretty printing. We've been ignoring the issue because the benefits of reducing visual bugs in a (potentially not?) rarely used and non-essential feature did not outweigh the substantial costs of creating comprehensive tests.\n\nHere's an idea of how to test this. Develop a set of representative queries containing errors nested deeply in a query to test various edge cases in the pretty printer. This would be a very manual process but once we're satisfied with the output we can add a test to the automated test framework that confirms that, for these queries at least, the backtrace output is still the same as it was at last visual inspection. This way at least we'll know if we accidently break backtrace printing as the drivers change.\n"
