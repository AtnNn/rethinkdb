      "Hi @soheilaabrishami .\r\n\r\n\"Connection is closed.\" might indicate that the RethinkDB server got terminated. Can you check if that's the case (e.g. does it respond after you run this once)?\r\n\r\nThere should normally be something about this in the log file. However if the server ran out of memory, it might get killed by the kernel in which case nothing is going to appear in the RethinkDB log file. You can check `dmesg` for hints about it instead.\r\n\r\nNote that the query you're running will cause the full table to be loaded into RAM because it gets returned as a single result, so that could cause the out-of-memory condition."
