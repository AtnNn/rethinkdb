      "So, the only difference I see in the `extproc/http_*` code between the `v2.0.5` and `v2.1.0-1` tags is changing `cJSON` to `rapidjson`, which, admittedly, I had been scrutinizing when trying to track this down.  The commits were 58184697, d7f43591, and 7286b9fb, in file `extproc/http_job.cc`.\r\n\r\nI don't see anything immediately wrong with this code, but I could be missing something obvious.  The bug, at its root, looks like an invalid reference to a temporary or freed shared buffer, which was possibly generated when parsing the HTTP response as JSON.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping to track this down, @ryan99fl!"
