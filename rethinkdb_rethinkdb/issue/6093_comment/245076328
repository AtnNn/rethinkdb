      "@analytik I don't think I've seen this issue before.\r\n\r\nIt must be related to some open `.orderBy.limit` changefeeds. Do you have information on which precise changefeed queries of that type are open on the cluster during the import?\r\n\r\nCan you send us a copy of the data dump that you've been getting this crash with?"
