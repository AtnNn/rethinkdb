      "I think there's a deeper problem here in that streams internally only know the name of a secondary index, but not its UUID.\r\n\r\nIt looks like it's possible with any streamed query that an index could be replaced by a different one with the same name in between two query batches, and the query would silently start to use the new index in the middle of streaming results (or maybe it crash the server?).\r\n\r\nIn the case of changefeeds, this problem is particularly severe, but I think it's not limited to them.\r\n\r\nThis might be non-trivial to fix, because the server that is processing the query currently has no way of locally resolving an index name to its UUID."
