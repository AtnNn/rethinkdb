      "@analytik To explain: running `rethinkdb restore --force` drops existing indexes and then recreates new ones under (potentially) the same names. The code in the `.orderBy.limit` changefeed implementation uses index names to reference indexes. Thus they didn't detect when the index was replaced by a new index of the same name while having the changefeed open. The patch adds a check for this, and the changefeeds now get closed when the index is changed."
