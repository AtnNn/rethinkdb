        "I wrote a script that created many tables in a database, then deleted the database while other processes were still creating tables in the database.  There is a relatively large window during database deletion for new tables to be successfully created.\r\n\r\nThese tables will show up in the web UI's stats, but will not be visible in the `Tables` tab, and the only way to see them is through the ReQL admin interface (i.e. `rethinkdb.table_config` and `rethinkdb.table_status`).  The tables can still be dropped or moved to a live database by writing to their rows in the `rethinkdb.table_config` table.\r\n\r\nExample rows for such an orphaned table:\r\n`rethinkdb.table_config`:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"db\":  \"__deleted_database__\",\r\n  \"durability\":  \"hard\",\r\n  \"id\":  \"1c3df91b-9676-4feb-9c61-f2afaa8a3e1e\",\r\n  \"indexes\": [ ],\r\n  \"name\":  \"99\",\r\n  \"primary_key\":  \"id\",\r\n  \"shards\": [ {\r\n    \"nonvoting_replicas\": [ ],\r\n    \"primary_replica\":  \"newton_jcf\",\r\n    \"replicas\": [ \"newton_jcf\" ]\r\n  } ],\r\n  \"write_acks\":  \"majority\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`rethinkdb.table_status`:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"db\":  \"__deleted_database__\",\r\n  \"id\":  \"1c3df91b-9676-4feb-9c61-f2afaa8a3e1e\",\r\n  \"name\":  \"99\",\r\n  \"shards\": [ {\r\n    \"primary_replicas\": [ \"newton_jcf\" ],\r\n    \"replicas\": [ {\r\n      \"server\":  \"newton_jcf\",\r\n      \"state\":  \"ready\"\r\n    } ]\r\n  } ],\r\n  \"status\": {\r\n    \"all_replicas_ready\": true,\r\n    \"ready_for_outdated_reads\": true,\r\n    \"ready_for_reads\": true,\r\n    \"ready_for_writes\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```"
