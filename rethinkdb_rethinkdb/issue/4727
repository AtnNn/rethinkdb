        "I wrote a script that created many tables in a database, then deleted the database while other processes were still creating tables in the database.  There is a relatively large window during database deletion for new tables to be successfully created.\n\nThese tables will show up in the web UI's stats, but will not be visible in the `Tables` tab, and the only way to see them is through the ReQL admin interface (i.e. `rethinkdb.table_config` and `rethinkdb.table_status`).  The tables can still be dropped or moved to a live database by writing to their rows in the `rethinkdb.table_config` table.\n\nExample rows for such an orphaned table:\n`rethinkdb.table_config`:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"db\":  \"__deleted_database__\",\n  \"durability\":  \"hard\",\n  \"id\":  \"1c3df91b-9676-4feb-9c61-f2afaa8a3e1e\",\n  \"indexes\": [ ],\n  \"name\":  \"99\",\n  \"primary_key\":  \"id\",\n  \"shards\": [ {\n    \"nonvoting_replicas\": [ ],\n    \"primary_replica\":  \"newton_jcf\",\n    \"replicas\": [ \"newton_jcf\" ]\n  } ],\n  \"write_acks\":  \"majority\"\n}\n```\n\n`rethinkdb.table_status`:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"db\":  \"__deleted_database__\",\n  \"id\":  \"1c3df91b-9676-4feb-9c61-f2afaa8a3e1e\",\n  \"name\":  \"99\",\n  \"shards\": [ {\n    \"primary_replicas\": [ \"newton_jcf\" ],\n    \"replicas\": [ {\n      \"server\":  \"newton_jcf\",\n      \"state\":  \"ready\"\n    } ]\n  } ],\n  \"status\": {\n    \"all_replicas_ready\": true,\n    \"ready_for_outdated_reads\": true,\n    \"ready_for_reads\": true,\n    \"ready_for_writes\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n"
