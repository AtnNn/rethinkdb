        "With #5235 we now provide a warning when swap is used, to try and help users distinguish RethinkDB performance problems from underlying issues. However this seems to be a bit too aggressive on MacOS and so is providing warning to me almost every time I spin up a local cluster. In addition to the WebGUI warnings, this is also causing problems in some tests that look that all issues have been resolved.\n\nWe should probably disable it for now on MacOS X.\n"
