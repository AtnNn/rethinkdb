        "I updated to version ```2.3.0``` from version ```2.2.6``` and am experiencing a regression in my testing that I haven't been able to attribute to any changes made internally.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I have a table with a secondary compound index named ```by_which_then_what_then_when``` against the attributes ```[r.row['which'], r.row['what_id'], r.row['when']]```.  I have the following three documents inserted.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"913\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-04-07 at 3 48 05 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2500718/14364732/2f8d287c-fcd8-11e5-9356-fc5ef79da77b.png\">\r\n\r\nI perform a ```between``` query on this table, followed by an ```order_by``` using the secondary index ```by_which_then_what_then_when```.  This works as expected on both version ```2.2.6``` and ```2.3.0``` for both ascending and descending ordering.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"915\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-04-07 at 3 59 00 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2500718/14365082/cf1e3290-fcd9-11e5-8ee0-6f8662d8e12b.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"906\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-04-07 at 3 59 13 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2500718/14365085/d620a7da-fcd9-11e5-8139-2918486e4b03.png\">\r\n\r\nWhen I tack on an eq_join against another table in the database, I used to recover correct ordering (consistent with the ```order_by``` and the previous two screenshots) in ```2.2.6```.  However, in ```2.3.0```, the ordering appears to be lost.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-04-07 at 3 59 32 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2500718/14365086/db3cc578-fcd9-11e5-9eb9-2a5400844748.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"916\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-04-07 at 3 59 48 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2500718/14365095/e18f81b8-fcd9-11e5-9987-ce69a79136b7.png\">\r\n\r\nI've noted the problem using the Python driver as well.
