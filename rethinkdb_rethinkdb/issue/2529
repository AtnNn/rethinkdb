        "When I insert small documents into a table with soft durability with servers running on magneto and electro I get very weirdly inconsistent insert throughputs.\n1. Sometimes the insert rate on a new table would first go up to a high value, then drop to 0 and remain there for about 1 second before resuming at its regular speed. I could even reproduce this on a single node\n2. With only one node in a cluster, I got stable insert rates of ~20k inserts/s. With two nodes in the cluster (but the table still being on only the one same node as before), I one time got about the same rate. Another time I got a maximum of ~6k which was extremely stable.\n3. Sharding the table into 2 shards did not improve the throughput over the rate I got with a single node. That is very odd, especially since I connected clients directly to both nodes in the cluster and they are not CPU bound or anything like that.\n\nOverall this is super weird. I can run the experiment five times and each time the performance behavior is different. Sometimes I get 6k inserts/s, another time I get 14k, then 20k. In either case, it seems to \"stick\" for a while with whichever rate it started with more or less. Sometimes it changes after a few minutes. Sometimes it has the stall at the beginning. Other times it doesn't.\n"
