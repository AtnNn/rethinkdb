      "> I think upsert makes a lot of sense, although maybe we should change the name. It just means \"insert these rows, even if you clobber old rows\"\r\n\r\nYeah, I agree. The problem is that there are two ways to clobber old rows (replace and update), and we arbitrarily provide one (with the wrong name!) We could replace the `upsert` flag with a `clobber` flag that can take on values `'update'` or `'replace'` (obviously with a better terminology than `clubber`). I think that would be really nice."
