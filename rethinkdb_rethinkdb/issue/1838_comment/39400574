      "I also strongly prefer `{overwrite: 'error'}`, `{overwrite: 'update'}`, and `{overwrite: 'replace'}`. It gives people more options and is much more clear than `clobber`.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't worry about backwards compatibility -- I'd just remove `upsert` and let people migrate (I don't think there is a need to overcomplicate the API so early by taking on the compatibility burden)."
