      "I am trying to figure out why I really hate `on_conflict`.  I think the real reason is that it sounds like an uncarefully thought out name.  Imagine you're a user of a database or a Java API or whatever.  If you see some option named `conflict` or `overwrite` or `dream`, it sounds like, okay, the people making this thought things through.  If you see `on_conflict` or `if_conflict`, it sounds like the people making this are lazy and just threw together an API with the first name they could think of, or just don't know any better.  It gives the product a slapped together feel, the kind Objective-C has.  (\r\n\r\nAlso, specifically: onConflict is definitely just awful in Javascript where such on-prefixed property names always take a real function to be evaluated when an event happens.  It's by convenient an event-handling name in C# too, and just generally in other languages.  It's less terse than necessary.\r\n\r\n`conflict` is a good name.  `{conflict: 'error'}`.  `{conflict: 'overwrite'}`.  It's clearly what you do if there's a conflict, just as with `on_conflict` -- I don't think `conflict` could possibly drive people towards an incorrect interpretation of what it does, relative to what `on_conflict` portends -- and it also doesn't exude any sense of amateurism.\r\n\r\n(So in conclusion I think on_conflict is bad (a) because it's a bad name, and (b) because it looks bad to have a bad name.)"
