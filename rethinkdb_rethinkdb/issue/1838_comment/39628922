      "@sorccu -- thanks for the input!  It helps a lot to know what people outside the core development team think about names.\r\n\r\n@srh -- Applescript is bad because they try to replace formal structure with something that looks like grammar, which is obviously silly.  This is entirely different from choosing a keyword to read naturally.  As a general rule, if you have two sane structures and one reads more like English, it will be easier for people to scan that one.  (This is why `x.func(y)` notation is winning over `func(x, y)` or `(func x y)` notation; people, or at least English speakers, like subject-verb-object structure.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, this discussion seems to be descending into pedantry, and I think at this point I'd be reasonably happy with any of the surviving options, so let's just take a vote.  Anyone who cares, say the options you like below this post and I'll tally them up.  (@sorccu, I'll put you down for \"conflict\" and \"duplicate\".)"
