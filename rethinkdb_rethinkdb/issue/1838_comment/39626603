      "If we ever allow a resolution function then `on_conflict` is a bad name.  Resolution functions are not callbacks.  The `on_conflict` name only sounds good for the superficial reason that its options are all verbs and sound like actions, so the name sounds like it \"fits the pattern\" when actually it doesn't."
