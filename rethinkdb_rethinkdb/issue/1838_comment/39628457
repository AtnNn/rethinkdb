      "As on outsider, I would personally prefer `conflict` out of the options presented so far.\r\n\r\n* `clobber` is hardly obvious enough\r\n* `overwrite` is a bit confusing because it sounds like the decision to overwrite has already been made, or, without seeing the values, it sounds like a boolean flag similar to `upsert`\r\n* `if_conflict` and `on_conflict` would be horrible with the JavaScript API, and they don't really match any existing API option that I know of. They have an overall \"afterthought\" feeling\r\n\r\nPerhaps one more option might be `duplicate: 'error', 'update', 'replace'`. It would be essentially the same as `conflict` but give a bit more detail about the cause of the conflict, and in my opinion would make it a bit more easier to understand (\"update duplicate\", \"replace duplicate\", \"duplicate is an error\")."
