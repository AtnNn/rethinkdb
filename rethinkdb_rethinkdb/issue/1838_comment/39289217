      "I prefer the `on_conflict` argument because it's more intuitive to read, at least for me.\r\n\r\nNot sure about the importance of the update rather than replace variant. Some people had asked for it, so it would probably be useful. No matter whether we implement it immediately or not, the change in the argument name alone would be an improvement."
