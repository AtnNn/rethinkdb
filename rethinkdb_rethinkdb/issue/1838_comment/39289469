      "I would expect `on_conflict` to take as its argument some sort of conflict-resolution function.  I'd prefer a name without `on_` in it -- it's not a callback, even if a conflict-resolving function were allowed, it would not be a callback.\r\n\r\nTaking a bool is clearly bad for the usual reasons.  (We'd also have to think of a name other than `clobber`.)  The question is if there is name would be better than `conflict`.  How does `{overwrite: 'none'}` or `{overwrite: 'update'}` or `{overwrite: 'replace'}` look?"
