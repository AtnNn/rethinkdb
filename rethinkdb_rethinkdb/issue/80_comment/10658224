      "Homebrew tends to be faster than macports because it doesn't end up compiling quite as much from source.  It's newer, perhaps a little easier to use, and seems to be the install-linux-programs mac package manager of choice at the moment.  It also supports binary packages that it calls \"bottles\".\r\n\r\nI like postgres.app: http://postgresapp.com/ which is postgres distributed as a normal mac os x app (no .pkg installer).  It's got a menu bar icon for updating and starting automatically at login.  It's open source too, if you guys want to base a RethinkDB.app off of it."
