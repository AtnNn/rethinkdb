      "dmg and zip tend to be more for things that get dragged into the Applications folder. Our unmanaged downloadable package would probably be a pkg so as to put things in the right places. I would probably need to make a launchd job.\r\n\r\nWe could distribute the buildable sources with dependencies in one of those formats as well, but, for maintenance of those packages, we would still need a script for downloading the dependencies, and shipping that in the source package instead of all of the dependencies would probably save a lot of bandwidth.\r\n\r\nFor the binary package, my preferred vector would be a downloadable pkg file.\r\n\r\nWe probably cannot do MacPorts since the dependencies might frequently fail to build correctly.\r\n\r\nI do not use Homebrew because I do not like its installation model, but we could make a Homebrew package. This would be very similar to our pending rethinkdb-portable package for Linux. We would bundle in our source package any dependencies not met by Homebrew and chain those through the Makefile rather than using my chain-builder script.\r\n"
