        "Our current process for building web-assets is flawed for a number of reasons:\n1. It requires people to install less, handlebars, and coffeescript, which many potential contributors complained about.\n2. The development process of these projects often involves breaking changes, so rethinkdb build process can often break as a surprise to us and our users.\n3. Our solution to prebuild web assets for tagged versions of rethink is ok, but it doesn't help people who want to be on the bleeding edge.\n\nI propose the following alternative:\n- Check in js versions of less, handlebars, and coffeescript into the repo.\n- During the build, instead of using `lessc` and friends, just use v8/node to build our web assets.\n\nThis gives us a number of benefits:\n- People who want to build rethink off bleeding edge don't have to deal with less, handlebars, and coffeescript dependencies\n- We can simplify our configure script by removing all these dependencies\n- We'll have complete control of upgrading to newer versions of these components\n- The issue of web assets breaking will go away in practice\n"
