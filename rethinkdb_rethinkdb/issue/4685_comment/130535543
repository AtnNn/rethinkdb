      "Yes a segfault could happen as far as I can tell because in `~real_multistore_ptr_t` we destruct the serializer first, before we drain `drainer`.\r\n\r\n`real_table_persistence_interface_t::is_gc_active()` appears to assume that the drainer lock is enough to make sure that the serializer pointer it got from `get_serializer()` remains valid.\r\n\r\nNot directly related, just noticed it when looking at the code.\r\n\r\nI might have been overly optimistic though to suggest that this could be an explanation for #4675. Do we call `is_gc_active()` only for the jobs table?"
