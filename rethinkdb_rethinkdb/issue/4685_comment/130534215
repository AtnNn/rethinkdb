      "Thanks @neumino !\r\nLooking at the code this looks like a debug-only problem. We check whether the pointer is null, but only after calling `get()` on a `scoped_ptr_t`. In debug mode the call to `get()` triggers the assertion. In release mode it will work as expected and return null, which is then handled further up the call chain."
