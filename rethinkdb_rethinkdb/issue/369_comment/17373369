      "I went with 256, since 512 sounds a little excessive (I could be wrong, but they're both way better than 5).  Review was 488.  Merged into next in commit 8517c56, and cherry-picked into 1.4.x in commit 12634e3.  Will be in 1.4.5 and up.  Leaving this as open because I don't feel that the new connection coroutine spawning has been adequately addressed."
