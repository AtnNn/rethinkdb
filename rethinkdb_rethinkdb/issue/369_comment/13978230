      "How would using `spawn_now_dangerously` increase the likelihood of filling up the backlog?  Getting connections accepted and in-place as soon as possible decreases that likelihood.  Using `spawn_sometime` would just increase that likelihood (or have no effect at all.  We call `spawn_now_dangerously` *after* calling `accept`.  Regardless of the behavior of `accept`, how does whether we call `spawn_sometime` or `spawn_now_dangerously` have anything to do with the speed at which we accept new connections?\r\n\r\nWe should change the value from 5 to SOMAXCONN, which is 128 on Linux."
