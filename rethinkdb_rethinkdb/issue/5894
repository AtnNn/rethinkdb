        "I recently have some issues when doing `count` query with rethinkdb.\r\nI want to get the count of records of which `field1=true`, which has an index on it.\r\nand most of the records are qualify for this condition.\r\n\r\nThe performance varies a lot:\r\nenv 1: rethinkdb version: 2.0.3, record size: 15K, 2 cores, 8G mem => very fast(about 200ms)\r\nenv2: rethinkdb version: 2.1.5-2, record size: 15K, 16 cores, 64G mem => instant(less than 100ms)\r\nenv3: rethinkdb version: 2.0.4, record size: 50K, 2 cores, 8G mem => very slow(2min+)\r\nthe query I tried:\r\n`r.db('db1').table(\"table1\").getAll(true, {index: 'field1'}).count()`\r\n`r.db('db1').table(\"table1\")(\"field1\").count(true)`\r\n\r\nenv3 is for production, so we need to figure out why and how to solve it.\r\n\r\nAny ideas/suggestions are welcome. Thanks a lot!"
