      "Nope, I found no performance issue. I just read such code and found it doesn't sound scale enough. Thus I thought we might improve it a bit by append new key at tail.\r\n\r\nI modified the btree_metainfo unittest a bit to insert 6000 keys: this patch make it go faster from more than 2 minutes to less than 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments a lot; and sorry that I haven't gone that far yet; I just started to look some core code. However, with a first glance at update_metainfo(), it does sound that we have room to improve."
