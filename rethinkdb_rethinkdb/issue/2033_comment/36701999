      "So, the reason I wanted to do the optarg is because I heard many, many times that people hate the names `group` and `reduction` and would like an easy way to rename the fields. We will eventually implement `rename`, but that's still annoying -- you'll have to call `ungroup` *and* `rename` to get what you want. Since people will frequently want to ungroup and rename, I think it makes sense to special case `ungroup` to support this functionality for convenience.\r\n\r\n(Also, to limit the scope of the discussion, I think `ungroup` is a fine name and we should leave it as is)."
