      "I personally like `ungroup` but I don't like the idea of passing an optarg to rename the groups.\r\nWe should implement https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/881 instead of adding the optarg.\r\n\r\n`toArray` would be confusing because of `cursor.toArray`\r\n`groupsToArray` is long and kind of confusing I think since the user just sees an array if he runs `table(..).group(...)`"
