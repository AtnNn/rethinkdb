        "Currently `rethinkdb restore` and `rethinkdb import` always create tables with the default settings, which means that the tables will be neither sharded nor replicated.\r\n\r\nI propose adding `--shards` and `--replicas` parameters to `rethinkdb import` and `rethinkdb restore`, which will be passed into any `table_create` call.\r\n\r\nNote that you can only specify one set of shard/replica parameters per import process. If different settings are needed for different databases, users could run `rethinkdb import` multiple times for only a single database or table."
