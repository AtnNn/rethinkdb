Also mentioned this:\n\n> just to be clear, I just changed the user/group and the execution path thats all I ddi in the config file\n\nI can see how the pid-file directory might be inaccessible if something is off with the config, but I don't understand why it's then deleting the data directory itself.\n\nGoing to ask him for the full config file and git branch used.\n"
