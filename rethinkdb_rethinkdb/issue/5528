        "This adds two features to `rethinkdb-dump`:\n- A `--quiet` flag\n- Writing the output archive to stdout\n\nThe second feature quite obviously depends on the first one, since we can't print messages and a tar archive to stdout at the same time.\n\nThe wording of the help option was inspired by `man tee`.\n\nExample commands you can test:\n- `rethinkdb-dump` - should work as before\n- `rethinkdb-dump` - should work as before but print no output\n- `rethinkdb-dump --file=out.tar.gz` - should work as before\n- `rethinkdb-dump --file=-` - should print lots of rubbish into your terminal\n- `rethinkdb-dump --file=- | tar tz` should print you the files in the tar file\n"
