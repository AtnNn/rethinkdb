      "This is not related to `reql_admin`. I was able to reproduce it easily on `next` at 24ceede9a533eee440f602c464e6e5b710b20a28. I started a cluster of two machines; created a table and inserted some data; set it to 2 shards and 2 replicas; and then ran your commands. I think this bug can occur whenever a table has two shards on the same machine."
