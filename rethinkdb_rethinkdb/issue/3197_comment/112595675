      "@frankleng We actually restructured the roadmap for the two upcoming releases slightly. The features this needs are now going to be in 2.2 (2.1 will instead have auto failover and improved cluster management). According to the current plans, 2.2 should be out relatively quickly after 2.1. My guess is about 8 weeks from now.\r\nSorry for the delay."
