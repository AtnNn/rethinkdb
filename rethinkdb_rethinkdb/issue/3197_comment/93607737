      "Hey guys, I just put the initial (very very beta) version of the logstash input up at https://github.com/rethinkdb/logstash-input-rethinkdb/tree/master . \r\n\r\nCurrently, it needs a logstash filter to be able to pipe directly into ElasticSearch, so this is one piece of the puzzle, not the entire thing. That being said, I'd really appreciate any early feedback you can provide if you're interested in playing around with it."
