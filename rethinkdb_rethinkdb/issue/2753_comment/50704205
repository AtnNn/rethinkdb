      "I think the best way would be to limit a changefeed server to a set of primary key ranges. These would have to be configured from elsewhere such that they always cover exactly the key ranges for which the given store is a primary.\r\nThe mod report has a `primary_key` field by which you could then check whether it falls into one of those ranges."
