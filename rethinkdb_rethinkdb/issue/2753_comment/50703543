      "This apparently *does* exist in 1.13.x, and occurs any time you have both a primary and secondary for a table on the same machine.  Apparently they will share a `store_t` (or, at least, there are always 8 `store_t`s per-machine whatever I set the replication factor to), and so the subscription to the primary ends up sending changes on the secondary.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes -- is there an easy way in `on_mod_report` to detect whether the modification is being done by a primary or a secondary?"
