      "I'm confused as to how you have Ubuntu 12.04 running with a 2.6.32 kernel, which should be Ubuntu 10.04.  The TCP_USER_TIMEOUT socket option was added in kernel version 2.6.37, and we use that for detecting dead connections between nodes.  This should be available in Ubuntu 11.04 and up.\r\n\r\nWe'll probably be adding our own heartbeat so we can get rid of the TCP_USER_TIMEOUT requirement for extra portability in the future, I'd imagine it will be fairly soon."
