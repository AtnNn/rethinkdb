        "With Apple further depreciating OpenSSL (#4963) there has been some discussion about removing OpenSSL as a dependency. There are a number of odd corners that we currently depend on OpenSSL that will have to be covered if we are going to do this, and some possibilities to do so:\n- `src/client_protocol/server.cc` uses it to get a sha256 digest\n  -  include a single-file sha256 implementation\n  - `mbed TLS` (formerly `PolarSSL`) is an alternative\n  - on MacOS ComonCrypto provides a drop-in replacement that has full OS support (see `COMMON_DIGEST_FOR_OPENSSL` in `/usr/include/CommonCrypto/CommonDigest.h`)\n- The `s2` library that we use in `geo` support uses it for bing-number support. This is limited to a single file (`exactfloat.cc`).\n  - we could try to pull the bignumb support out of OpenSSL and include those files in our project\n  - it is possible that `mbed TLS` has support that we could use\n  - `gmplib` might be used as a replacement for bignumb support\n- When we build `libcurl` we link it against OpenSSL when not on MacOS (there we use `--darwin-ssl`)\n  - `mbed TLS` is a good candidate here, but there is an outstanding question about whether it can use the root certs on MacOS.\n"
