        "Running on the NoBrainer test suite:\r\n\r\n![screenshot60](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/297060/2531026/edb073d6-b52c-11e3-9da4-2afb0e756a69.png)\r\n\r\nYou can see that `r.table(\"simple_documents\").index_wait` was called before `r.table(\"simple_documents\").orderby({:index => r.asc(\"field1\")})`, but the query errors with `Index `field12` was accessed before its construction was finished`\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n1) `git clone https://github.com/nviennot/nobrainer.git`\r\n2) `cd nobrainer; bundle`\r\n3) `DEBUG=1 rspec ./spec/integration/criteria/order_by_spec.rb:82`\r\n\r\nThe bug appears 30% of the time here.\r\n\r\nSometimes, index_wait waits for `10003.3ms` and the test passes. The fact that it's sometimes waiting exactly 10s indicates some hardcoded timeout of 10s in RethinkDB codebase. I wonder what's that for."
