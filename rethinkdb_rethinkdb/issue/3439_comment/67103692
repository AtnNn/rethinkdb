      "I am not 100% clear on what portion, if any, of ReQL is executed clientside in drivers. I would vastly prefer that this term and its contents be sent to the server unmodified for it to manage.\r\n\r\nThis avoids implementing a critical security feature N times in N languages, which would make it difficult to verify the validity of a third-party driver. My current understanding of ReQL is that very few operations are managed clientside, so this concern may be unfounded."
