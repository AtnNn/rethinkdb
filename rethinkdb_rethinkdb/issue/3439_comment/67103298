      "+1 for `static` or `datum`, no huge opinion there.\r\n\r\nPerhaps worth discussing is if the term should fail, or return a copy of the object that has been cleaned (no further terms in it). That was my original proposal in #3438, but post-discussion I can't think of a scenario where I'd want to continue executing something that I expected to be a datum but wasn't. Plus it'd be a more complicated implementation.\r\n\r\nSo failing with an error seems reasonable."
