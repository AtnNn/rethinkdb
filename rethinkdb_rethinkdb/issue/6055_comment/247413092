      "@danielmewes in the meantime... are there any \"best practices\" for adding nodes to a cluster to minimize read-only access to tables?  \r\n\r\nmainly -- we add nodes in order to have more storage space across all nodes -- but in order for that to happen, rethink must re-shard and re-replicate the data which causes a lot of backfilling to happen.\r\n\r\nis there a way to seed new nodes with a set of data from one of the other nodes such that it doesn't have to backfill quite so much?"
