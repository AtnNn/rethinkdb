      "@danielmewes Thx.  Although, it's the splitting into shards that takes the time.  We'll take the hit during the \"creating more shards than nodes\" phase anyway, correct?\r\n\r\nWe're also wondering if we had an enterprise support contract with you guys would there be anything else that could be done?  That is to say, would it make any difference to us finding a viable solution to growing our cluster?  \r\n\r\nThis is a significant enough hurdle that we may have to find an alternative datastorage solution as a week without write access to our tables is a deal-breaker for our customers.
