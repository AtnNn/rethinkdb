      "@bsharpe Correct, the potential benefit would be that you would take the hit only once. I'm skeptical to be honest if this is worth it though, since there's also the loss of efficiency due to the over-sharding (this basically will affect any query that uses secondary indexes).\r\n\r\nMore importantly: I didn't realize you're literally experiencing a week without write access! That is insane. During resharding, write availability should only be impaired for a couple seconds (maybe tens of seconds) periodically throughout the process, but tables should be available for the majority of time. The backfilling itself should not impair availability at all.\r\n\r\nThe tables will not be \"fully available\" during this time, but most write operations should be able to go through.\r\n\r\nAre you actually getting consistent write failures during the backfilling process?"
