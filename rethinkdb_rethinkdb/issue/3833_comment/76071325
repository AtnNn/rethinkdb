      "I would guess that this is the OOM killer.  How large are the documents in your table?  The result of `r.table('t').group({index:'idx'})` can be manipulated efficiently in ReQL, but if you try and send the whole thing back to your client you'll end up trying to send back the whole table's worth of data, which will load a *lot* into memory.  We abort this process around 100k elements (picked pretty arbitrarily), but if you have largish documents I could easily see 100k documents + 700kb cache using up all your RAM.\r\n\r\nThe long-term solution to this is https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1375 ."
