Thanks for clarifying @AtnNn .\r\nLooks like we should do some testing to see where all the memory usage is coming from.\r\n\r\n@elifarley I assume this is a different (or extended) data set than the one from https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3703 isn't it?\r\nIs there a chance you can send us this data set as well so we can reproduce the issue?\r\nIf yes, I could give you access to an upload server so you can upload the file safely."
