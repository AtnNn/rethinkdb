      "@deontologician: I don't think that trying to be that pedantic/literal is really worth it. There is going to be some overlap, and that is ok. These names are only to reflect the over-arching goals of the sections. Additionally, since these are going to be a part of the name you have to type to get to a specific test, making them that long is a bad idea.\r\n\r\n@mlucy: I really dislike the name `polyglot`, since that is talking about an implementation detail, not a testing goal. The testing goals really are simple: to test the server and to test the clients. That we are going to have some \"chocolate in our peanut butter\" is ok. Over time I think people will naturally write tests more aligned with the name, but I anticipate that there will always be some mixed. I don't see that imperfection as being worth obscuring the over-arching goals for."
