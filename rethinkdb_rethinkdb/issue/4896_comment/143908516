      "Will the polyglot tests be split between client and server tests?\r\n\r\nI'm honestly not too sure the distinction works well.  Most of the tests I write test both the client and the server at the same time.  (For instance, when you add a polyglot test for a term, you're adding it both to check that it's implemented in all the clients and to check that the server passes some basic sanity checks on its behavior.)"
