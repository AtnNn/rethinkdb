      "The thinking in that case was that those should probably go in the `client` folder, since you defiantly want to make sure that all of the clients handle it. The `server` folder would be for things where it does not really make sense to test it in all driver languages. I am not really concerned that we wind up getting at least some server testing in on the `client` tests."
