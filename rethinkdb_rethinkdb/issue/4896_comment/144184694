      "We talked about this a little more at lunch.  Here's an alternate hierarchy:\r\n\r\n* Unit Tests\r\n* Cluster Tests\r\n* ReQL Tests (this has some toplevel tests like `get_all.rb` in addition to the subdirectories below)\r\n  - Changefeed Tests\r\n  - Polyglot Tests (maybe with a different name, but these tests should be in all 3 languages)\r\n* Performance Tests\r\n* Fuzzers\r\n\r\n@danielmewes, @deontologician, @VeXocide, @encryptio, @larkost -- do you prefer this hierarchy or the `server/client` one?  (Or one of those but with some minor changes?)"
