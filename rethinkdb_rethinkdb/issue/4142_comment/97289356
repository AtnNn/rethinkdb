      "The reason this is happening is that one of the arguments to STATUS is the TABLE, and TABLE fails if you evaluate it on a non-existing table name. It's not STATUS that's failing, but its argument.\r\n\r\nSTATUS is simply a short cut for the system table read. The only reason for using it is that it's shorter to write.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?"
