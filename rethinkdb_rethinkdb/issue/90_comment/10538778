      "You should take this issue. I believe this is a regression -- we had a similar issue before which was fixed. I don't remember what the cause was, but I believe it was pretty simple.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is this -- `NO_EPOLL` might have been only meant for builds with `LEGACY_LINUX` turned on. Try turning on both `NO_EPOLL` *and* `LEGACY_LINUX` -- do you experience the same problem? If that turns out to be the case, we should probably fix `NO_EPOLL` to work even in the absence of `LEGACY_LINUX`, because that's a sensible thing to do."
