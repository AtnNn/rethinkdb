      "@coffeemug - Ran same query via Python driver and it's working as expected.\r\n\r\nRan into another issue where I ran the query, and it acts as if it never sets up the changefeed although the initial result is returned? \r\n\r\nI see that without running any query that it is doing some sort of heartbeat to the server for I assume information on the different nodes currently connected in the cluster. But after running the query, it pings one constantly as seen here (for you @deontologician):\r\n\r\n![for_josh](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/863286/9946730/09c7490c-5d4a-11e5-9494-4791f3301b61.gif)"
