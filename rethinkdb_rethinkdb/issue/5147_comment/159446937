      "Yes, it closes one (unlikely) hole. But more importantly it allows for specifying full paths when calling the \"scripts\" making testing and development a lot easier. It also opens the door to driving the scripts directly without calling the `rethinkdb` binary directly, which could mean you call backup from another computer (not that this would be a good idea from an i/o perspective)."
