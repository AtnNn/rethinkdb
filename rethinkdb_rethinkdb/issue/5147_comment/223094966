      "A second round has also been added to `next` with d9a31bc4 after CR 3643. It cleans up dump/import and has the side effect of making them slightly (up to 15% in my test case) faster. Most notably the semi-opaque `rdb_call_wrapper` function has been simplified into a per-query function that is a lot easier to read.\r\n\r\nTwo more things remain to be done before I call this one done:\r\n1. An experiment to see if combining the reader and writer processes into a cluster of processes that do both yields any speedup.\r\n2. Applying the same lessons learned to the `dump`/`export` routines. Note that a lot of the work of straightening these out has already made it in here."
