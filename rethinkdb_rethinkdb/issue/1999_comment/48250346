      "I think the current implementation has a general problem of usability + perception. There are a couple of solutions I can think of (though I don't know if some of these are possible or how much work they are):\r\n\r\n- Only return a ratio and artificially ensure it's monotonically increasing. That would be better than what we have now because it would solve many perception issues for people.\r\n- The problem with a monotonically increasing ratio is that it might be stuck at a low point (say, `.1`) and then suddenly jump to `.9`. This is better than what we have now, but still not ideal. Preferably the ratio would increase gradually to actually represent the state of the backfill, otherwise it isn't very useful.\r\n- The ratio is ok, but it's *really* nice to be able to tell how much data transfer we're actually doing in blocks/megabytes. If we do this, we should make sure the denominator doesn't actually change. I don't know if this is doable -- if not, I think we should stick with returning just the ratio."
