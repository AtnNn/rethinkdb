      "> Also, the numerator and the denominator both change, which makes the progress feature unusable in real life scenarios.\r\n\r\nI don't fully follow on this one. Is the problem that the progress value is not monotonic? Or that the denominator changes? I know this is based on an actual user issue, but maybe you have more insights better knowing the context.\r\n\r\nThe latter doesn't seem like an issue. If you are not interested in the exact blocks estimated, you can simply convert the value to a decimal number.\r\n\r\nThe solution to the former would be to artificially force the fraction to never decrease, though that would be arguably worse. It's in the nature of predictions based on incomplete information that they change as more data becomes available."
