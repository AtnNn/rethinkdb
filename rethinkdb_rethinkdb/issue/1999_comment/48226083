      "Actually another problem is that backfills that are being held back because there already are too many concurrent backfills going on don't report any estimates. I think their progress is just 0/0 or -1/-1 or something like that. That's technically fine, but makes it more difficult to get a good overall progress estimate (you could for example assume that those shards are approximately as big as the other shards, and use the average number of estimated blocks from the other shards as the number of blocks for the throttled ones)."
