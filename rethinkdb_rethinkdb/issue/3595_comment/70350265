      "FYI: I've been running this small test case for ~1000 cycles so far and haven't gotten any errors\r\n```php\r\nwhile (true) {\r\n        r\\tableCreate('t0')->run($conn);\r\n        r\\table('t0')->wait()->run($conn);\r\n        r\\tableDrop('t0')->run($conn);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll keep it running for somewhat longer to see if anything eventually happens.\r\nIf not, we should double-check that we didn't somehow had two tests running against the same server at the same time.\r\nAlternatively, there might be something crucial to reproducing the bug which I'm not replicating in my minimal test.\r\n\r\n@larkost also mentioned to me that this was working until at least about a week ago, so we could theoretically try bisecting git history (though it might take a while)."
