        "Suggested by Steven Perez.\r\n\r\nIn changefeed documents, we currently implicitly encode whether they are a deletion, and insertion, an update/replace or an initial result by setting some of `old_val` and `new_val` to `null` or by omitting `old_val` entirely.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to encode this information explicitly by adding an additional field. For example\r\n`action: 'delete'`\r\n`action: 'insert'`\r\n`action: 'replace'`\r\n`action: 'initial'`\r\n\r\nIncidentally, our current system also breaks if you have a changefeed like this:\r\n`r.table('t1')('a').changes()`\r\n\r\nand you set the value of `a` to `null` for a document. The generated change event will be indistinguishable from a deletion. Additionally, when deleting a document that currently has `a: null`, no change event is generated."
