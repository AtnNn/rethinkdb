        "As mentioned on this blog post -- http://c2journal.com/2012/12/06/rethinkdb-nightmare-1-service-wont-start/ RethinkDB init.d experience isn't ideal. Here's what I think we should do to improve it:\n1. Until we're ready to install rethinkdb service by default, Linux installation packages should print a message at the end of `apt-get install` stating that we don't install the service by default, and that the users should go to http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guides/startup/ to set up RethinkDB on startup.\n2. Fix #188 (make config file copyable without any changes).\n3. Fix #250 (better bind error message), and add `--bind all` to the default config script.\n4. Have init.d start/restart print a message pointing the user to the server logs (to make things less confusing if something goes wrong)\n\nAssigning to @atnnn.\n"
