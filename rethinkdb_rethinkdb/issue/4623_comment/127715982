      "Hi @kulbirsaini, there might still be something wrong here, but this isn't necessarily unexpected.\r\n\r\nIf you start 10 equivalent queries all at exactly the same time, I would expect them to finish at close to the same time as well. All of the queries have the same priority to the server, so it doesn't have any reason to favor one over the other.\r\n\r\nSince the server is under higher load, the individual queries also take longer. I think that's also expected.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?\r\n\r\nI think if you use more different queries, you'll find that they do return at different times as well."
