      "A potential fix for this is in `next` (OTS by @danielmewes).  We think the bug might be caused by calling `note_reshard` in the destructor of `local_replicator_t`, which previously happened *before* that object's auto-drainer was destroyed, meaning that `changefeed_subscribe_t`s on the old region might still be queued up and wind up happening *after* `note_reshard`."
