      "Thanks for chiming in @kofalt .\r\nYou are right, good multi stream support would be one of the primary criteria for choosing a protocol. The other one being encryption and authentication. \r\n\r\nI think at the moment there's no strong need for doing this switch. It would cause work for all driver developers, and we already have decent support for multiple concurrent cursors on one connection in our current protocol (especially after #3296 is done). At the same time using TLS/SSL for encryption around our current protocol would be a much less invasive way to get encryption and basic authentication https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3158 ."
