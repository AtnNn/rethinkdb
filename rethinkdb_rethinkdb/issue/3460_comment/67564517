      "To flesh out the WebSockets idea:\r\n1. it does have the concept of multiple streams, but like HTTP2 they are all over a single TCP/IP channel, so you have to wait for one batch before the next (unlike SCTP)\r\n2. It is similar to HTTP2 in that it gets HTTPS (WWS) for \"free\" in that you up-negotiate from a HTTPS connection.\r\n3. There is a lot of libraries that support it, but the languages behind our drivers don't have them built in.\r\n4. It would make possible having applications without a server-side component from browsers that speak WebSockets already (most modern ones). Our currently lack of authentication/roles on the server would make this a bad idea at the moment.\r\n5. It is very close to a raw socket in most ways, so more like our current system then http semantics.\r\n"
