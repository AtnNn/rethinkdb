      "IMO `r.connect(backend=X)` is better than a separate module, but what happens if people start two connections with different backends? Will they interop properly?\r\n\r\nOne other option is `r.set_async_backend(X)`, which I think is a good choice. Yet another option is `import rethinkdb.twisted as r`, which I think is more pythonesque than `import rethinkdb_twisted as r`."
