      "Hi @RaitoBezarius, when we are going to ship this will depend on how much demand there is for this backend.\r\nImplementing it should just need a `net_twisted.py`, and a few tests for it (like the one in `test/rql_test/connections/tornado_connection.py`). We're happy to support you if you want to give it a shot!\r\nFor another data point, see this pull request by @takluyver for a Python 3 async backend: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/4071 ."
