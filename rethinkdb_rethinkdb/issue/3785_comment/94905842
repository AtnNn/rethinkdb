      "@RaitoBezarius Very cool. I'm looking forward to your pull request. Feel free to put it up even before it's completely ready If you like, so we can give you early feedback.\r\n\r\nWe have this article on how the protocol works http://rethinkdb.com/docs/writing-drivers/ . I think for porting to Twisted you probably won't need most of this, since those things are taken care of in the higher levels of the driver (not in the `net_*.py` file)."
