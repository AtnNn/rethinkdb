        "On npm for instance you could publish for instance `2.1.0-alpha.x`. Where alpha is a [pre-release tag](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#prerelease-tags).\n\nIt's perfectly safe, it won't be installed if someone does not specifically request it (`npm install rethinkdb` will install the latest stable version, npm install rethinkdb@2.1.0-alpha will install the latest alpha of `2.1.0`).\n\nI ask this because I would love to have https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/4080.\n\nSame goes for other drivers (hence the separate issue and not a comment on #4080).\n\nCould I maybe interest you in some kind of service which would publish a nightly build every time there are changes on the driver ? (also this would be way easier to do it the driver was in a separate repository)\n"
