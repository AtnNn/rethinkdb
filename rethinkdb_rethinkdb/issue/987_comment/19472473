      "The cause of these issues is:\r\n\r\n1. The protobuf library installed by brew has the correct version, but it is built with libstdc++, so it is unusable with rethinkdb which uses libc++.\r\n\r\n2. There are other ruby protobuf libraries that have an incompatible rprotoc tool. The correct one is ruby_protobuf, but see also #783"
