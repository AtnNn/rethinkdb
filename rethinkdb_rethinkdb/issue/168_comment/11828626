      "I don't think this is a bug.  Rather, when you restart server 1, you aren't telling it to connect to the cluster, so of course the cluster doesn't know about the zombie server.  When you declare the server dead, its entry is removed from the directory and such, so that no reconnection attempts are made.  Merely starting up the zombie rethinkdb process is not enough, it needs to try to join something."
