      "Does `sync(...)` take a durability optional argument?  The reason I proposed it as `sync` and not `flush` is so that the command can be potentially expanded via optargs so that a different criteria is reached -- soft durability, for exmaple, or something more specifically specifying soft durability to a certain number of replicas (all of them, instead of just some of them, so that subsequent out-of-date reads will see the change).\r\n\r\nThe word `flush` has some very specific connotation.\r\n\r\nAnd I have no idea what \"copacetic\" means, using big words is exclusionary so please stop."
