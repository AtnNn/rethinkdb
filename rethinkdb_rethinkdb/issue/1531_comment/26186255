      "I actually think that having this all grouped under `sync` might make a lot of sense. `sync` is how you explicit say: \"I want to make sure people are in sync with my changes\" You can `sync` with hard durability which means \"I want to make sure people are in sync with my changes and have committed it to disk.\" which is the same meaning hard durability has in other places. Or you can bring say: \"I want to make sure they're in sink but just having it in memory is fine.\" The point is I think I like `sync` better for describing this behavior than `flush`."
