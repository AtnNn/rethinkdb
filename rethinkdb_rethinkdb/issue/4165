Some things that could be done to improve the situation are:\r\n\r\n* Use and define our own names instead of the mis-matched `__MACH__`, `__linux`, `_WINDOWS`, `__GNUC__`, `__clang__` and `_MSC_VER`\r\n* Use feature-specific macros instead of compiler and OS specific macros.\r\n* Add more feature detection to the configure script, and generate a `config.h` file\r\n* Factor out some of the compiler-specific `#pragma` declarations (using `_Pragma` instead)\r\n\r\nI would also love to read other suggestions."
