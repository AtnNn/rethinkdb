      "This assertion is wrong.  A page with a deferred_page_loader_t -- one that's only going to the serializer to get a block token -- would have is_loading() return false and is_disk_backed() return true.  One thing that's messed up is that this function, `should_be_evicted`, is the only caller of `is_loading()`."
