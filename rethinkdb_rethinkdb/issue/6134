        "Hey team rethink. I'm having a peculiar issue where a `getNearest()` runs nice and fast on my local machine (~50ms), but very slow on a deployed cluster (~800ms). \n\nIt's the same exact data. About 100 documents (each with a handful of nested data). A geo index on `coordinates`.\n\n**Local machine**\nServers: 1\nVersion: 2.3.5\nCache: 1.1GB\nClient connects directly\n\n**Deployed cluster**\nServers: 3\nVersion: 2.3.5~0jessie\nCache(each): 1GB\nTable replicas on all 3 nodes\nClients connect through a rethink proxy\nDeployed via kubernetes\n\n**Query:**\n\n``` js\nr.db(\"xxx\").table(\"places\").getNearest(r.point(-73.97438, 40.7691017), {\n    index: \"coordinates\",\n    maxDist: 14,\n    unit: \"km\",\n})\n```\n\nAny insight as to what the difference in performance might be? Happy to give more information. \n\nThank you all!\n"
