        "We have a really nice shorthand notation for doing `filter` which a lot of people have found very useful.\n\n``` Python\ntable.filter({\"a\" : 1, \"b\", 2})\n#desugars to\ntable.filter(lambda x: x[\"a\"] == 1 & x[\"b\"] == 2) \n```\n\nThis is a proposal to extend this notation to make it even more useful.\n## Proposal\n\nWe extend the static sugar in `filter` to accept single argument functions as the values in the static value sugar in `filter`. This would allow you to do queries like this:\n\n```\ntable.filter({\"a\" : r.match(\"\\d*\")}) # check if an attribute matches a regex\ntable.filter({\"a\" : r.gt(5)}) # check if an attribute is greater than 5\n```\n\nThis seems like it would require a bit of jiggering in the client libraries but I think it's doable.\n"
