      "The issue I ran into was custom helpers signature. We definitely had a lot of custom helpers, so unless they were taken out, it should still be an issue (talk to me and we can see if we can find them in the codebase together). In any case, if this is still a problem, it should be very easy to port them to the next version of handlebars."
