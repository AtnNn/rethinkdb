      "I'm going to bump the version of handlebars used on the web ui first.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug, you told me once that there was a bug/not compatible thing with the new version of handlebars. \r\nThe only non compatible change seems to be the signature for custom helpers (https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/) , which we don't have if I'm not mistaken.\r\nDo you remember what was it?\r\n\r\nEverything seems to work fine with the latest release 1.0.11.\r\nI'll run some tests sometime this week with 1.0.7 (the version shipped with npm on Ubuntu 12.04) and see with @atnnn which one we should keep."
