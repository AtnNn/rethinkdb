That was undone for #4602 because, if ICU was being fetched, it used `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` which is crippled by default on newer versions of OS X for security reasons.\r\n\r\nDecoupling ICU from V8 again would decrease the compilation time of rethinkdb and decrease the size of our source and binary packages."
