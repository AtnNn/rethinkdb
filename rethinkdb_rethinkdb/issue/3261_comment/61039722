      "The only system table for which import would work is `cluster_config`. `table_config` and `db_config` would fail because they require auto-generated primary keys for new documents, and even if they didn't, `table_config` would require that your cluster already be set up with the same set of servers with the same names.\r\n\r\nAlso, export doesn't make much sense for `jobs`, `issues`, `table_status`, `server_status`, `stats`, etc.\r\n\r\nI think we just shouldn't export system tables. If we do, we could export a whitelist but refuse to import them even with `rethinkdb import -f`."
