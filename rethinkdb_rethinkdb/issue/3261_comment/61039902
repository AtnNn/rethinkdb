      "Funny thing, when I was testing this, `rethinkdb import` actually didn't encounter any errors, but still imported everything, even to non-writable tables like `table_status`.  This was because nothing in the cluster had changed since the export, so results looked like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  'deleted': 0,\r\n  'errors': 0,\r\n  'inserted': 0,\r\n  'replaced': 0,\r\n  'skipped': 0,\r\n  'unchanged': 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe may want to change this to throw an error, but I'm not sure how hard it would be to do."
