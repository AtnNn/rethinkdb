      "> We may also want some guarantee that users don't run this script on a pre-reql_admin server and miss exporting any tables that happen to be in a database named rethinkdb.\r\n\r\nDo you think we should check the server version?\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that this is sufficiently rare that we could actually ignore the issue. Someone would have to install the new python driver while keeping the old server *and* have a database called `rethinkdb` to run into this.\r\nOn the other hand if we can do some super simple sanity check that works 99% of the time (e.g. check that the `rethinkdb` database contains a `server_status` table or something like that), I would be happy with that."
