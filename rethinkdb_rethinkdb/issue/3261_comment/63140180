Changed the scripts to import/export any tables in the 'rethinkdb' database with an error message:\r\n\r\n* `Error: Cannot import tables into the system database: 'rethinkdb'`\r\n* `Error: Cannot export tables from the system database: 'rethinkdb'`\r\n\r\nWe may also want some guarantee that users don't run this script on a pre-`reql_admin` server and miss exporting any tables that happen to be in a database named `rethinkdb`.\r\n"
