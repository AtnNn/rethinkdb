      "Hi @scottder, the first issue might indicate a wrong password. Do you have an admin password (previously auth key) set on your cluster? If yes, you can try passing in the `-p` option.\r\nIf you have TLS enabled for the driver port on the server though, this won't work since you'll still need the `--tls-cert` option. (In either case the error message is bad, which we have fixed in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5624 but not released yet.)\r\n\r\nThe second issue is https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4815. I'll bump that issue and mark this as a duplicate. Do you have a more recent version of Python installed that you could use for the meantime?"
