      "Hmm actually it's still slow with #4773 fixed.\r\n@deontologician is the query that retrieves the cache usage the same that fetches the index status? If yes, we might want to split the index status out because it can become pretty slow at the moment. Ideally we would make sure it doesn't get that slow in the first place on the server of course. I'm still looking into that."
