      "Oh I see. There's no way to do this out of the box.\r\n\r\nYou can implement a \"run script\" script that does something similar to what the Data Explorer does though:\r\n\r\n1. Separate the script file into individual queries. This is the most complex part. You can find the Data Explorer's implementation of this step in the `separate_queries` function here: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/admin/static/coffee/dataexplorer.coffee#L2773\r\n2. Call `eval` on each of the individual queries to evaluate them to a query object\r\n3. Call `.run` on each query object, waiting on the returned promise before you proceed with the next one."
