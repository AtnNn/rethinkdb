      "> I think this is your first C++ PR? :-)\r\n\r\n@danielmewes yep! :D I've made updates based on your comments and refactored all those separate optarg checks in the JS driver into `util.isPlainObject(obj)`. I replied to your comment regarding the behavior when `step == 0`. Just let me know if you think we should support that.\r\n\r\n> Are you planning to add support in the other drivers as well? We can take over that part if you prefer.\r\n\r\nWould be great if someone else could take over, thanks!"
