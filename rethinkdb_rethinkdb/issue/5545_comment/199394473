      "Thanks for updating the PR and for the `isPlainObject` refactor.\r\n\r\nLet's keep disallowing `step == 0`. It avoids potentially unexpected behavior and allowing something later is always easier than the other way around (with respect to backwards compatibility).\r\n\r\nThe only remaining question is the name of the option. I'll talk to some people to figure this out and let you know later today."
