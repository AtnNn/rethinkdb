      "I've been experimenting with a solution to this as part of my work on #490.\r\n\r\nHere's what I want to do:\r\n\r\n* replace yaml with a similar custom format that does not require escaping queries and that uses less indentation.\r\n* Do not require the result of the queries to be typed out. When run with a certain flag, the test suite will fill in the output of the queries, either inline or in another file. This output would also include backtraces.\r\n* When a test fails, make it obvious which one and how. Also add a flag that causes the tests to open a repl when it fails.\r\n* Replace the current system that converts queries between languages with a regex by a solution that takes a python query object and pretty-prints it into other languages."
