      "I don't know what the scope of this is (I know the system isn't ideal, but I don't know what's involved in making it better). Putting this in 1.10. The milestone is getting really big, so I think we should break it up into multiple releases. I don't know quite how to prioritize things yet in order to break it up -- we should talk about it. I'll look through all the issues tonight and try to come up with a model for what to do in my head."
