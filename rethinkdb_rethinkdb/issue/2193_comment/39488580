      "I just looked at my raspberry pi, and I have v8 3.19.0-1 installed.\r\n\r\nBut I don't remember how I installed it.\r\n- On my blog I wrote that I used AUR, but the package on AUR is older than the version I have installed.\r\n- I don't have v8 in `external`\r\n\r\nSo  guess II have probably built it from source."
