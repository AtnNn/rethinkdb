        "Currently when compiling you get a debug build if the `DEBUG` environmental variable is set, and a release build otherwise. This works, but it does have some side effects:\r\n\r\n1. When running tests we need to know where to look for the built version of the server. We use a best-guess method currently of looking for folders in the master build directory and then use the one that has the most recent timestamp. This works semi-magically, until someone touches something in another folder, then it falls flat.\r\n\r\n2. If a test needs to build something it has to first use the above trick, then interpret the path to determine if it is a debug build, and then use `make` based on that. This is liable to be wrong.\r\n\r\n3. This collection means we can never build externally to the git repository. We don't have anything that is pushing us in this direction currently.\r\n\r\nIf we switched to making this a setting in `./config` then the target build folder could be set in the `config.mk` file, and scripts could be changed to use that."
