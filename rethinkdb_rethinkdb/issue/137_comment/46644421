      "> What if you're writing to those files at the same time in another client?\r\n\r\nWhy would writing to files be a functionality?  People can make new files.  The only way writing to files would make sense is for appending to them at creation time, in which case the file's not actually created yet.\r\n\r\n> We can make the chunks reference-counted if we want to allow the same file to be linked from multiple documents.\r\n\r\nNo, you can't make the chunks (or files, since it's not like chunks would be used by two different files) be reference counted across the cluster like that."
