      "There are basically two ways to do this:\r\n* Add a binary data pseudotype that base64-encodes the data (the easy way).\r\n  - Keeps the property that all RethinkDB data has an easy, rereadable JSON representation.\r\n  - Will probably take well under a day.\r\n  - Super easy for third-party driver developers to implement, can be done by hand if a user is stuck with a driver that doesn't support it.\r\n  - Not actually that bad space-wise (8 bits -> 6 bits is, what, a 33% increase in size)?\r\n    * Space can be reduced by gzipping query data in transit or on disk.  (This is probably a good idea anyway -- the redundancy introduced by base64 encoding is pretty small compared to the redundancy in most data.)\r\n* Extend the client-server protocol to support sending binary data separate from the JSON-encoded query (the hard way).\r\n  - RethinkDB data no longer has a straightforward JSON representation.\r\n  - Slightly harder to implement (but still not bad at all).\r\n  - Harder for third-party driver developers, no way to do it without driver support.\r\n  - No space overhead."
