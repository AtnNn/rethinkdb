      "> What if the user uploads 4 KB at a time? Where's the logic that prevents us from having a bunch of 4 KB chunks?\r\n\r\nWould 4KB chunks be so bad?\r\n\r\nWhatever chunk size we pick, we force users to upload that much data before comitting the chunk.  If they can't upload one chunk's worth of data before getting disconnected, we throw it away."
