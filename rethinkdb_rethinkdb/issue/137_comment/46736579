      "> If the information \"this file exists\" and the actual contents of the file are in the same location, in the same b-tree, you don't have these problems.\r\n\r\nThis argument makes sense to me.  If people really don't care that much about being able to distribute a single file, we probably shouldn't spend time thinking about concurrency to support it.\r\n\r\n(Also, a follow-up question: does anyone know why Mongo *does* use a table of chunks if people don't want any of the benefits?)"
