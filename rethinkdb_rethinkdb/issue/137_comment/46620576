      "Also, it's a terrible idea to have a special `system` db.  That is totally cargo cult mimicry of SQL databases' attempts to work around the ANSI SQL syntactic paradigm.  All a special read-only table does is emit a selection.  If we want to emit a selection for perfmon statistics, we can add a command `r.stats()`.  Done.  Adding a special `system` database means that anything listing databases or doing generic administrative work might have to add a special case to omit things in that database."
