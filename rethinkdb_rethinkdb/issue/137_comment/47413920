      "> Suppose you have some chunks on a node that dies. The file would still be in the READY state, but part of it would be inaccessible.\r\n\r\nThis is no worse than the current situation with a sharded table -- if the master goes down, you can't access some of your data.\r\n\r\nIf someone tries to delete a file and some of the chunks are inaccessible, the `delete` fails with an error message.  The user has to declare the node dead or bring it back up if they want to finish deleting the file."
