      "@coffeemug -- so, just to be clear, the scope of this issue is larger than \"add a binary pseudotype\", right?  Do you have a sense of what other abstractions we want to offer?\r\n\r\n@srh -- I agree with most of what you said.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning more and more toward a base64-encoded pseudotype for the first implementation.  It's easy to switch out (i.e. it doesn't have tendrils into a thousand other little things like some ReQL choices we've made), and it will be easy for both us and third-party driver developers.  (Also, we can switch out bits of it piecewise -- the way we send it on the network, the way we store it in memory, and the way we write it to disk can all be changed independently of each other at no real cost.)"
