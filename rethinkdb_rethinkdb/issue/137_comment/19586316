      "Suggested by JulianMorrison on https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5886624:\r\n\r\n> Take binary input in the form of a no-args generator function (called repeatedly, returns a series of binary blobs and then null as EOF) or where the language permits, allow a language specific abstraction of a read-once stream such as an IO in Ruby as a higher level wrapper for that. Return binary data in the same form."
