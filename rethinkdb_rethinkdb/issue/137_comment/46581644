      "Personally I hate how MongoDB's gridfs is required to be a totally separate database. At the database level there is no way of associating a file with other data, you have to embed a reference to the file in the data, read it in the application layer, and then request the file. I think that there is some wisdom in how the files are stored internally as multiple chained records, but requiring the user to be exposed to this directly always seemed bad to me. I would much rather have at least the *appearance* of the files being a part of the document.\r\n\r\nSo I am not a fan of exposing the file chunks table (or metadata table) to the users. I see the real advantages of having such things (re-using existing machinery), but think that those details should be hidden from everyone, possibly even driver writers."
