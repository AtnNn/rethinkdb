      "Hey, I know you guys are super busy, but I wanted to bump this issue. I'm dealing with a lot of binary data at the moment, and while Base64-encoding everything is fine for now, eventually I'd really like a way to safely store blobs of binary data.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on when this can make it in? Also, out of curiosity, what are the issues with just sending/storing binary data? I'm assuming it's not as easy as just shoving an array of binary data into the driver and sending it off otherwise you guys probably would have done this already.\r\n\r\nOne more question: would it be possible to index on binary fields? Right now my IDs for everything are hex-string representations of binary data, and while I'm not in a hurry to convert my IDs to binary, I'm wondering if it would be possible once binary storage is implemented.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
