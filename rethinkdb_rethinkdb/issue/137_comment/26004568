      "The biggest issue with storing binary data right now is how we'd handle compatibility. Right now RethinkDB has the nice property that every value in it has an obvious representation as JSON. This means that driver developers don't have to think too hard about how to represent ReQL datatypes in their language. Most languages have a canonical JSON library and representing ReQL values the same way it represents JSON values serves as a very good baselines for an implementation. This is something that we're eventually going to have to do but because it'd be breaking one of our basic design assumptions it's a lot to think about so we're opting to put it off until we achieve production readiness. Sorry I can't be more helpful on this one we'll get it in as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen we do have binary data types you will definitely be able to index on them."
