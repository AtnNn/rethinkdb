      "> For example the query layer suddenly has to distinguish between an unreachable and a dead node.\r\n\r\nI don't quite follow.  When you declare a node dead, its shard responsibilities get re-assigned, right?  So the `delete` can continue just fine (it will go to the new master for that shard, find nothing, and skip the missing chunks).\r\n\r\nActually, thinking about this more: one problem is that the responsibility might change to a replica, which might not have performed all the writes the master did, possibly leaking chunks (since the size in the metadata has already been updated).  We'd have to either add slightly-clever logic to the \"declare dead\" code to increase the size of the partially deleted file or add a \"cleanup\" command that scans the whole file table and deletes any chunks that the metadata says shouldn't exist."
