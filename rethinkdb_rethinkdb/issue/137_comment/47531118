      "> Would 4KB chunks be so bad?\r\n\r\nAll you have to do to answer this question is a little bit of thinking.\r\n\r\n> Whatever chunk size we pick, we force users to upload that much data before comitting the chunk. If they can't upload one chunk's worth of data before getting disconnected, we throw it away.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter.  This is just the first thing you didn't think of because chunking makes stuff more complicated."
