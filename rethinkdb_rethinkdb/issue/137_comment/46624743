      "> Also, you can't just have files existing inside of a database either. They need to exist inside of tables of some sort, for the administrative benefits you get from that.\r\n\r\nIf we let people optionally specify a different chunks table, there would be a way for people who really want special replication etc. settings for one file to get it, but in general people could adjust the settings for all files at once by changing the settings on the chunks table."
