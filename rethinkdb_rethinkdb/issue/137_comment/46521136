      "> Internally, Mongo does this by having two special tables: a metadata table and a table of file chunks. I think that's actually a pretty reasonable architecture.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mena a metadata table?  What metadata would it have?\r\n\r\nWhy would you want a table of file chunks, and not a table of files?"
