      "As to chunks: there are real advantages to chunks, but I think in practice they will perform the same as blobs or worse for 99% of user's workloads, and the other 1% RethinkDB won't be good enough for anyway.\r\n\r\nIf we need chunks for reasons of perception, then I think that's fine.  It's a little more work but not all that bad."
