      "We have to move forward on the design. Here is what I've decided:\r\n\r\n- Users need to be able to shard individual files, which means we'll have to build this feature on top of tables. This is a case where a small, seemingly insignificant feature departure is huge in users's minds and would put us into an entirely different product category, so marketing requirements win.\r\n- Users need to be able to insert, list, and delete files as first class objects, so a file can't just be a ReQL type that gets inserted into a document.\r\n- It's really nice to be able to link to files from documents and to be able to specify and query user-defined metadata, and it'd be great to incorporate that into the proposal in an elegant way.\r\n\r\nI opened #2647 to discuss a system with these requirements. Thanks everyone for your input -- I realize this isn't the direction everyone agrees on, but I think it's the best way to proceed. I'll keep this issue open for a few more days in case there are additional comments."
