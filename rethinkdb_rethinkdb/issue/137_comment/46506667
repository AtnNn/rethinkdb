      "> Just to be clear, the scope of this issue is larger than \"add a binary pseudotype\", right? Do you have a sense of what other abstractions we want to offer?\r\n\r\nYes, although if we decide to implement a binary pseudotype and then something else on top of it we can break that out into a separate issue. Please read about MongoDB GridFS -- it's good to know what the state of the art is. It will give you a good idea of the rough direction of the thing.\r\n\r\nA rough sense is to allow people to store and retrieve large media (e.g. videos). I'll post a bit more about my ideas soon, and will chat in person."
