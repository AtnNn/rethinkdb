      "> I think the chunks should be stored in the same file with the table that references them.\r\n\r\nThis seems bad to me.  I don't see any reason to say that files should be sharded/replicated the same as some table that references them, or any reason to say that only one table can reference a file.  Since files are large, the cost of not having it stored in the same table is small compared to the cost of moving the file around."
