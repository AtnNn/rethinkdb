      "> Actually, another question: if we're storing each file as a big blob on disk, how hard is it to cache sections of that blob but not the whole blob? I'm not too familiar with that part of the code.\r\n\r\nThey're just implemented on top of the buffer cache the same way b-trees are, and the blocks (of size <=4KB) that make up a blob_t are cached the same way as any other buffer cache blocks.  In other words, if you regularly accessed only part of a blob_t, that part would be cached and the other part would not be loaded from disk."
