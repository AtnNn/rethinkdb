      "To clarify, if we go with separate uploading etc., I would make this:\r\n\r\n```rb\r\nr.file_create(X)\r\nr.table('test').insert({id: 0, file: X})\r\nr.table('test').get(0)['file']\r\n```\r\nreturn a pseudotype that supports `seek` etc.  So you could still have e.g. media clips with metadata attached, it's just that you can also list the clips separately from the documents containing them.  (This is actually more useful for e.g. user avatars if you want to have generic avatars, because all the users with the generic avatar can point to the same file under the hood.)"
