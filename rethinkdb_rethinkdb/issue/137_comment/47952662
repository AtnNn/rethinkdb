      "> Users need to be able to shard individual files,\r\n\r\nIn the interest of employee morale, maybe you should:\r\n\r\n1. Tell us *why* you believe users need to be able to shard individual files.\r\n2. Tell us *why* you think users think they need to be able to shard individual files.\r\n3. Explain in your own words the increase in technical difficulty of implementing this.\r\n4. Explain in your own words the availability downsides and upsides.\r\n5. Explain in your own words the performance downsides and upsides.\r\n6. Explain why the simpler task, that's nearly a subset of the work, of storing the files without breaking them up, shouldn't be implemented first with us then reevaluating the question of sharding individual files.\r\n7. Identify which features we're scheduling later to make room for the extra development effort for sharding individual files.\r\n\r\nWhen answering #2, assume that the reader thinks you're in some database company CEO reality distortion field with an unnatural awareness of irrelevant implementation details, and convince him/her that you're not."
