        "When I was running `apt-get upgrade rethinkdb` on Ubuntu 14.04, I ran into post-install scripts that errored out saying `/etc/init.d/rethinkdb` is missing (sorry, I don't have the exact error message now.)\r\n\r\nI had replaced that file in production with upstart (located at `/etc/init/rethinkdb.conf`), but did not realize that would severely impact my ability to upgrade rethinkdb.\r\n\r\nNot sure there is a good solution here, maybe there isn't one, perhaps I shouldn't have replaced `/etc/init.d/rethinkdb` with a custom upstart script, but figured I would let you guys know since I lost a few hours to it this evening. Luckily we have staging servers.\r\n\r\nOverall, I thought I would be able to upgrade rethinkdb and handle restarting the service myself."
