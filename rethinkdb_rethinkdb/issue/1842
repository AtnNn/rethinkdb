        "I'm trying to optimize the Ruby driver due to its poor performance: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1798\n\nOne of the issue is that building queries is really long.\n\nConsider this benchmark:\n\n``` ruby\nrequire 'rethinkdb'\nrequire 'benchmark'\nextend RethinkDB::Shortcuts\nputs Benchmark.measure { 10000.times { r.table(\"users\").filter({:attr => \"123\"}).orderby(r.asc(\"id\")).limit(10).to_pb } }\n```\n\nOn my machine with ruby2.0p353:\n\nOn the `next` branch, the average time to build the query is `0.55ms`.\nWith the \"don't parse the backtrace all the time\" commit, it drops to `0.31ms`.\nWith the \"Refactored the RQL methods\" commit, which precompiles all the RQL commands, it drops to `0.27ms`.\nIf we were to make no calls to `caller` to retrieve the backtrace, it would drop to `0.18ms`.\n\nHaving the backtrace is nice (which is only used in the case of an error), but is ridiculously expensive.\nNote that this test is running with a very small backtrace, but on a real application, the backtrace will be much larger. It's not uncommon to see a backtrace depth of 100 functions in a web application when hitting a controller with instrumentation all around the place.\n\nTaking the `0.27ms` baseline (with the two commits merged in), when I run the benchmark in a fresh Ruby-on-Rails console instead of its own process, the average time jumps to `1.2ms`. This is really sad.\nWhen removing references to `caller`, it goes down to `0.58ms` which is still sad. I don't understand why I'm not getting the previous `0.18ms`, it's probably due to all the crap that gets injected in some core classes.\n\nRegardless, I think the nice to have backtrace feature is not worth the `0.6ms` of overhead.\n\nIt might even be worth considering some sort of query caching, perhaps like redis: http://redis.io/commands/evalsha or postgresql: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/sql-prepare.html\n"
