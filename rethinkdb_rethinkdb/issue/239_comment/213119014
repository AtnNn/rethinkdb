      "@jrote1 The work-around is to check out v2.3.0 (or v2.3.x if you want the latest bug fixes), remove the check in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/rpc/connectivity/cluster.cc#L985 , compiling from source, and hoping that it works.\r\n\r\nAs the issue says, we aren't testing this. It might still work in practice, or it might not (you might get server crashes when running certain queries etc)."
