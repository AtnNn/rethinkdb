      "This is currently affecting me. \r\n\r\nI've got 65 racked 64bit machines booting livecds with rethinkdb preinstalled, and one 32bit 'minnow' that's supposed to be responsible for keeping the data online even with the racked machine powered off.\r\n\r\nhttp://files.sllabs.com/files/images/pictures/companyx-minnow.jpg\r\n\r\nLooking to add some ARM server blades to the mix as well, based on these two SoC designs:\r\nhttp://www.hardkernel.com/renewal_2011/products/prdt_info.php\r\nand\r\nhttp://cubieboard.org/2013/06/19/cubieboard2-is-here/\r\n\r\nARM Cortex-A7 support & testing would be welcome.\r\nI'm in mountain view and can provide some eval equipment if it's needed for testing."
