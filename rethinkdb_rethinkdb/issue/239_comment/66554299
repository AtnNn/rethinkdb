      "There is a unit test that shows that the connections are refused:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ RUN      ] RPCConnectivityTest.DifferentArch\r\nwarn: Connection attempt from 127.0.0.1 failed, reason: incompatible architecture (local: 64bit, remote: 96bit)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the test part of this is taken care of, so I am removing this from tests.\r\n\r\n@danielmewes @coffeemug Is supporting connections between 32 and 64 bit machines something we are going to support in the foreseeable future? If not then we should probably close this issue."
