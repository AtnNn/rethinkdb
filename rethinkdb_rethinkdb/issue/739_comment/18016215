      "So one potential problem I see with solution 1 is non transitive connectivity, which we've had at least one reported case of. Suppose the twins aren't connected to one another but the other machines are connected to the twins; then the cluster will just become unresponsive indefinitely. We might want to just ignore this though, since we're now talking about 2 very rare cases cropping up."
