      "> Perhaps we can just arbitrarily pick one of them to be 'active' and put the other one in a separate part of the directory until the issue is resolved.\r\n\r\nWell... no because then we're arbitrarily picking one part of the data to be active and we can't just arbitrarily make remove half of their data.\r\n\r\nI think this is actually a really complicated issue here. We might want to wait on solving this until we broach data divergence problems and just try to get by with more informative error messages and big warnings that they shouldn't create machines with the same machine id."
