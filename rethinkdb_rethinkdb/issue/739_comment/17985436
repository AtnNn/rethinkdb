      "I actually disagree that solution 1 isn't user-friendly. If someone makes a mistake like this and one or both of the nodes crash with a descriptive error, this is about as good as anyone can expect. This isn't likely to happen during regular interactions with the system, only when learning it, so propagating this to the issue system sounds like an overkill to me. (We never had *anyone* complain when the server crashed with a reasonably descriptive error while they were playing with it -- they just tend to fix the problem)\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I think there is almost no advantage to solution 2."
