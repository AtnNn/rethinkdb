      "@coffeemug This is maybe technically feasible. It still seems like we'd have to handle a lot of corner cases with it like how does the second machine know that it should shut down when the first machine has already shut down? Also even if they shut themselves down there will still be a period when machines see both as up so we're going to need to audit all of those places. I can't say for sure but my gut reaction is that this solution doesn't really get us past too many of the corner cases and while I agree that ideologically it could be okay to automatically shutdown machines here a lot of the reason we decided not to do that was that it's also really hard to get that kind of behavior correct. You get emergent behavior really easily. I think about this a bit more tomorrow but I think we should probably throw up the bat signal on this one."
