      "Joe is right; if the non-transitive connectivity between the two nodes with the same machine ID persists indefinitely, then administrative operations on the cluster will also be broken indefinitely. I think the cluster would still be able to serve queries, though. If we're worried about this case, we could also add a mechanism so that the third machine can send a \"kill message\" to one of the machines with the same machine ID. But I don't think it's terribly important."
