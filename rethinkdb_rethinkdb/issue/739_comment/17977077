      "Is it technically feasible for us to crash both machines with an informative error message? If we can do that easily, I think it would be a good-enough solution to this problem. I know we made the decision not to shut down nodes in case of issues whenever possible, but this one is fundamentally different. It's a cluster misconfiguration error that can't just pop-up at runtime (and even if it does due to an admin error, they'll just restart the master and move on)."
