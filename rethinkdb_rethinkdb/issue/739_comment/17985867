      "That seems reasonable, given that the most likely way for this to arise is when somebody is playing around with the system.\r\n\r\nWe might consider changing solution 1 slightly so that the node doesn't bring itself down if its uptime is longer than every other node with the same machine ID. That way, at least one node stays up in the case of duplication, and tends to be one that's already established. For example, if there is an automated script that is repeatedly trying to restart nodes when they crash, this will lead to one node being always up even as the other goes up and down, rather than both going up and down. Of course, that's not a very important use case, but it's sometimes better and never worse than the original behavior I proposed."
