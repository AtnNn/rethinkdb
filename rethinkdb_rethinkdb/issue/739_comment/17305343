      "Hmm, I find that kind of hard to believe. It was a fairly explicit design decisions that machines should never die due to information received over the network. They have a startup phase during which they check things like port conflicts etc. and if all of those pass the only way to shut a machine down is to actually interrupt the process. We choose this policy because otherwise it's too easy for a user to get confused about why a machine isn't up and as far as I know we don't deviate from it anywhere. This is the reason that killed machines become ghosts rather than just being shutdown automatically."
