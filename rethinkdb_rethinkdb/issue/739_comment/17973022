      "Oh, in the directory we use `peer_id_t` not `machine_id_t` so I thought you were talking about the semilattice metadata. Checking for an entry in the directory seems to be correct. I'm not quite sure you can just do it on connection though and it's incorrect to exit in this case. You could have 2 machines on separate sides of a netsplit with the same machine id. When the netsplit gets resolved both will suddenly go down which will be a really confusing behavior. This should be an issue which users can resolve by killing one of the machines."
