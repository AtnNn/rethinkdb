      "Also, upon some further thinking: suppose we added an issue the user would have to resolve. In that case, we'd still have to audit all the places where the machines see duplicate peers :( So it looks like it's just a really nasty scenario we missed.\r\n\r\nOne option we might want to consider is to shut down both machines (i.e. the first machine that detects its dup sends the dup a cyanide message and then shuts down itself) and do nothing about the remaining edge cases for now. That would solve the immediate problem of people copying the data directory and starting a second node. We could then deal with the remaining edge cases if they ever pop up later (which they probably never will).\r\n\r\nWould be nice to find a \"real\" solution to this problem, but if we don't (or it's too complicated), this might be good enough."
