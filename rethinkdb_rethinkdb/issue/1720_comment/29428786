      "Oh, actually this behavior makes a lot of sense, even if it's sort of unintuitive.  If you're passing a value rather than a function, the value gets evaluated outside the scope of the filter.  This is in line with our evaluation semantics -- whether or not we should change those semantics is, of course, another question entirely."
