      "The problems with `any` and `not` still stand, but this doesn't seem like a bad interaction to me.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the implicit default for filter is so that if you have a stream of documents, some of which are missing a field, it works as intended.  This doesn't affect that use case, because it only comes up if you're using a constant for your filter value, in which case it either always produces an error or never does.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug -- when you get back, I think we should sit down and talk about filter.  I think we could do something better than what we have now, and it would be really nice to fix this for the LTS release."
