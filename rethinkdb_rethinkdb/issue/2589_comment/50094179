      "That's the second time that's happened (both of which were my fault).  I think what's going on is that I'm copy-pasting a line from another function into a loop and not noticing that it has a move in it (in this case the problem was in `union_datum_stream_t`, which is the only `datum_stream_t` that has a loop there).\r\n\r\nWe should consider looking into whether we can replace `std::move` with something of our own that expands to `{out = std::move(src); valgrind_mark_uninitialized(src)}` or something."
