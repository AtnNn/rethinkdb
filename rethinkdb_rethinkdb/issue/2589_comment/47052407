      "This is a very strange bug.\r\n\r\nI can't reproduce this by running the JS tests in next.  When I run the `arity.js` test, it passes:\r\n```\r\n== Running polyglot/arity.js test            \r\n== Successfully passed polyglot/arity.js test\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd when I send an empty group statement to the server myself, the `rcheck` in `group_term_t` produces the correct error.  This `rcheck` and the sanity check that fails in @neumino's backtrace both have exactly the same predicate, too.\r\n\r\n@neumino, does this still happen for you in next after a rebuild?"
