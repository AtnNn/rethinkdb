      "I wonder if `{out = std::move(src); valgrind_mark_uninitialized(src)}` would sometimes cause issues when the destructor of `src` is called.\r\nAfter all `src` is not uninitialized after the move. It's just in a state where it cannot be used safely anymore (but can still be safely destructed).\r\nWorth a try though."
