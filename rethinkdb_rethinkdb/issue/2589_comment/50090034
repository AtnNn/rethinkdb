      "I can reproduce this with `next` on `gantz` 100% of the time using `test/rql_test/test-runner polyglot/a.* -i js` - which runs `polyglot/aggregation` followed by `polyglot/arity`.  It does not work with just `polyglot/arity`.  Added some debug statements and something super weird is going on."
