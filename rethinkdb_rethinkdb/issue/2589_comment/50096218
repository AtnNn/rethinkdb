      "@danielmewes -- er, you're totally right.  We might be able to do something clever, but it's probably hard.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could replace `std::move` with our own version that acts like `std::move` in release mode, but always sets the source to a default-initialized version of that class in debug mode, so that we wouldn't have these bugs that only get reproduced under certain conditions."
