        "Currently `getNearest` `max_dist` has a maximum value of approximately 8 million meters [1] .\r\n\r\nIf one is interested in using `getNearest` where the possible results can be any document (i.e. over the entire earth), with a slice to get the top-10, or similar logic, then it seems the only way to do that currently is via a full table scan:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.orderBy(r.row(\"location\").distance(point))\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc: @danielmewes \r\n\r\n[1] Note that the actual maximum value that can be passed to `max_dist` is not clear either -- if one uses the value returned in the error message when the value is too large, the same error happens again, presumably because the value used internally is something larger than the value passed."
