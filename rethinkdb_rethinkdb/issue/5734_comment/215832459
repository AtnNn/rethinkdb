      "I think that the solution is that we are going to add a parameter to the server to allow for `TLS1.0` connections, which would enable connections from MacOS (and other systems with older OpenSSL libraries).\r\n\r\nThat will take care of making this possible, however I think we should also improve the error message that gets returned to the client to make this more understandable to users who run into it."
