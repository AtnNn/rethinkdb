      "@danielmewes and I discovered that this is probably because we only allow `TLS1.2`, and the version of OpenSSL that is on MacOS (0.9.8zh) does not have support for that protocol (introduced in 1.0.1). This means that all of the languages on MacOS (e.g. Python and Ruby), and anything compiled against the built-in OpenSSL, will not work when connecting with TLS."
