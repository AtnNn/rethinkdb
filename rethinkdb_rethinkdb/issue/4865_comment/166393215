      "@Cad From my brief read of `eventlet` it looks like it might be trivial to create a version of our runloop that would support it, namely replacing `import socket` in `./drivers/python/rethinkdb/net.py` with:\r\n```\r\nimport eventless\r\neventlet.import_patched('socket')\r\n``` \r\nBecause it is only patching the i/o methods, we can probably get away with that change only (plus some additional support files). If this is important to you please re-open and maybe we can schedule this. Note that I am slightly on-the-fence about whether it would be ok to use the same connection in multiple `eventlet` \"threads\"."
