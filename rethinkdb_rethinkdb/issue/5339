        "When testing `changefeed`s, especially `order_by.limit.changes` there are some cases when the server can validly re-arrange the order it does things, and this will change the specific output (but not the eventual state). For example:\n\n``` python\ntbl.insert([{'id':1}, {'id':2}, {'id':3}]).run()\nfeed = tbl.order_by('id').limit(2).changes().run()\ntbl.get_all(2,3).delete().run()\n```\n\nIn this case `feed` could be only the deletion of 2 (if 3 gets deleted first):\n\n``` python\n[{'old_val'={'id':2}, 'new_val'=None}]\n```\n\nOr we could see 3 move into the list for a moment:\n\n``` python\n[{'old_val'={'id':2}, 'new_val'={'id':3}},\n {'old_val'={'id':3}, 'new_val'=None}]\n```\n\nIn our yaml testing system we can use the following structure to make sure that we see the the right `old_val` and `new_val` records, but not make sure we have the right number like this:\n\n```\n- py: feedValue = fetch(feed)\n  ot: partial([{'new_val'=None}])\n- py: feedValue\n  ot: partial([{'old_val'={'id':2}}])\n```\n\nWhat I would like to add is a way of specifying that there is a value that we might see, so in this case:\n\n```\n- py: feedValue = fetch(feed)\n  ot: bag([partial({'new_val'=None}),\n               optional({'old_val'={'id':2}, 'new_val'={'id':3}})])\n```\n\nThis would take a bit of work to get into all of the languages, but would allow us to be more specific about our output.\n"
