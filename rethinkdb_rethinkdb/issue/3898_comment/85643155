      "@elifarley Oh awesome.\r\nAnother good starting point is adding the term to ql2.proto.\r\nOnce you do that, compiling RethinkDB should get you lots of compiler errors because of the new value not being handled in enums. This should point you to the places where you need to add code for chaining the new term through."
