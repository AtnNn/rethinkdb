      "Hi @GeoCloud,\r\nwe don't have any official benchmarks at the moment. We're planning to implement support for compound geospatial indexes at some point (i.e. mixing geospatial coordinates with non-geo data in the same index) https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2855 , but we're currently focussing on some other features.\r\nAre there specific geospatial features that you would need?\r\n\r\nGetting a subset of the data that's intersecting with a given bounding box is usually easy and pretty efficient. You can use the `getIntersecting` term for that and pass in a polygon that's describing the bounding box. http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/get_intersecting/\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have more questions."
