      "For the record, link-local addresses are really weird, and you probably shouldn't be connecting to anything besides 'localhost' through them (unless you have a very carefully provisioned network).  I'm not very familiar with them, but from what I can find, routers do not forward packets destined for link-local addresses.\r\n\r\nI tested this in python, and connecting to a link-local address on localhost works fine with either `%2` or `%eth0` (e.g.).  Is there a problem in node that keeps this from working?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there is an easy way to convert from the scope ID to the interface name - I vaguely remember looking into this before and giving up.  Perhaps we should just not report link-local addresses in `rethinkdb_status`, but that may be overkill."
