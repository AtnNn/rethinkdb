      "What does that interface after the address mean when connecting?\r\nFor a link-local address I would expect it to specify the interface on the *client* to use for reaching that link-local address. So the server's interface wouldn't help you anyway. I might be completely wrong about this.\r\n\r\n@neumino You could filter link-local addresses by removing those starting with `fe80::` (source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address#IPv6 )"
