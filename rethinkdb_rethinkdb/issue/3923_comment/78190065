      "So the reason why I found out what these indices was because I'm trying to implement a connection pool that automatically connect to RethinkDB instances.\r\nAnd because of a bug in the way I was picking the \"main\" address, I ended trying at some point to connect using this IPv6.\r\n\r\nSo in node from what I could find, you need to pass the name of the interface\r\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/issues/7395\r\nIt may just be a limitation of node though.\r\n\r\nI'll just try to avoid IPv6 for now in the connection pool, so feel free to close or put in backlog, especially since like you said, these link-local addresses are weird :)\r\n\r\n"
