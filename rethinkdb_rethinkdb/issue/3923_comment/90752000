      "@neumino @Tryneus Can I close this?\r\n\r\nIn my understanding of what the interface of a link-local address means, it wouldn't make much sense to change the format on the server. I think on the client you need to replace the interface by the client's interface name in any case, since the server cannot know how the corresponding interface on the client is called or which number it has (how would the server know which interfaces the client has in the first place?).\r\nI might be misunderstanding how link-local addresses work though."
