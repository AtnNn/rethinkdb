      "@mgingras: @danielmewes's response above about using `pip install backports.ssl_match_hostname` should be a good work-around until we get the new version out with this fix (and a couple of others). I have just been told that pre-build testing will begin in about a half hour, so that makes a release likely tomorrow or on Monday."
