      "I have what looks like a fix (I don't know how to completely simulate `pip` locally) in branch `larkost/4683-backports.ssl_match_hostname` (CR 3164). It turns out that binary distributions (bdist and bdist_egg) do not include any sub-folders unless they are in the `package_data` and `package_dir` entries in `setup.py`. Whereas sdist does not require this for inclusion."
