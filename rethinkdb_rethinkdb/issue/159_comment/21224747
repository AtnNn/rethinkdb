      "I don't think `r.index` is a good idea, since we don't use it elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI'd be ok with @mlucy's proposal (i.e. `order_by('foo', index='bar')` returns an error, tells them to chain two `order_by` commands).\r\n\r\nAlso, since this is getting a bit complicated, what do you guys think of moving this issue out of 1.8? (This bit is slightly complicated, but also the fact that we truncate keys in secondary indexes makes this hard). @jdoliner -- your call."
