      "@mlucy the point of using a heapsort would be for queries like that\r\n```\r\nr.table(\"foo\").orderBy(\"id\").limit(X).run()\r\n```\r\nWe don't have to sort the whole table to get the X smallest element. The smaller X, the less work we have to do.\r\n\r\nIf we have N shards, we can still look for the X smallest element in each shard, merge them, then do another heap sort.\r\n\r\nIt's more work that using std::vector and sort for sure. I let @coffeemug decide where to put that on the roadmap."
