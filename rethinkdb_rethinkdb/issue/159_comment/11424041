      "> Reversing the order of the operations doesn't fix the problem (in fact it makes the performance worse).\r\n\r\nHmm, the trouble here is that you can't easily reverse operations without potentially giving the wrong result. You've got to prove that `extend` doesn't override `id`, which in many cases isn't even possible.\r\n\r\nThat's cool though, we can say that initially `order_by` is only guaranteed to use an index when run on a `selection`, and not when run on a stream. We could also consider changing the API a little to make it clear for users when the index is and is not used."
