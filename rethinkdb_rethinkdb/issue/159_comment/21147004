      "Solving this issue probably requires changing the API for `order_by`. In particular there's no way for us to know when someone says:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ntable.order_by(\"foo\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nif `\"foo\"` is an attribute or a secondary index. (We can tell if it's the primary key.) And we don't want to write a smart enough optimizer right now to be able to figure that out. I think the API for this should be:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ntable.order_by(index = \"foo\")\r\ntable.order_by(index = r.desc(\"bar\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is easy enough to do that we could do it in time for 1.8. However there hasn't been any official discussion of this and it is an API change so unless everyone is happy with this we should bump this to 1.9 and have an official discussion of the API."
