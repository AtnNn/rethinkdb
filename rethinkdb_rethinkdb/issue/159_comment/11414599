      "I might say something stupid but I don't get why we would use 6 GB for a dataset that is 3 GB.\r\nWe should probably even use less than 3GB (except if the documents just contain the field `id`), no?\r\n\r\nI have another question by the way, how hard would it be to only sort what we need? That is to say to do a kind of lazy sort.\r\nHere using a heap sort should be pretty fast if we return as soon as we get the first element.\r\nI feel like this is what the user was testing."
