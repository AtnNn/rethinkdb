        "- ~~Convert cursor/connection tests to Python's unittest framework and node's nodeunit framework. The tests are fragile and write-only as naked scripts.~~\n\nAlso:\n- ~~Test `run_outdated` in py and js tests~~\n- Make sure default db works when passed to `connect`, not just to `use` in py and js tests\n- Test what happens if the user passed too many (or too few) arguments to connection level functions (e.g. `connect`, `use`, `next`, etc.) in the JS driver\n- ~~Test Python's `.repl()`~~\n- ~~Test for the the reservation of at least one row for the last batch in a chunked stream~~\n- ~~Make sure drivers (py and js) print queries -- `r.db(\"foo\").table(\"bar\").toString()` should roughly print `r.db(\"foo\").table(\"bar\")`~~\n"
