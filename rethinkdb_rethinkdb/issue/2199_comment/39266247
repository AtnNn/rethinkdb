      "@mr-world your code looks good, but it uses the `curl` command, which may not be a good idea. At least curl should be added to the configure script, a script for building curl should be added to `mk/support/pkg` and curl should be added to the dependencies of the debian, centos, osx and brew packages.\r\n\r\nIt would be much better and more portable to use libcurl instead.\r\n\r\n However, as discussed in #1383, I don't think adding wget to reql is a good idea."
