      "@mr-world -- The CLA is a license agreement that lets RethinkDB use your work in our product.  (I'm not a lawyer but it also has other specific legal advantages.)\r\n\r\nAs for your pull request, the code looks pretty good!  However, I noticed that your system calls do not check for EINTR.  It is generally best practice for portable code to check for EINTR and try the system call again.  Could you make this fix (around read, write, or other system calls that need it)?"
