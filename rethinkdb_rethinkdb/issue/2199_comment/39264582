      "@mr-world, thanks for this pull request!\r\n\r\nTo add to @srh's comments, the [CLA](http://www.rethinkdb.com/community/cla/) is a standard copyright assignment used by many open source projects (for example, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/), [Python](https://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/), [Meteor](https://contribute.meteor.com/)).\r\n\r\nAs the FAQ says:\r\n> This is part of the legal framework of the open-source ecosystem that adds some red tape, but protects both the contributor and the company / foundation behind the project. It also gives us the option to relicense the code with a more permissive license in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you have more questions, feel free to ask."
