        "Instead of `<hostname>_<random_letters>`, we should pick some interesting names. I understand violent stuff is out, but that doesn't mean it needs to be bland random letters.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty off good names on here: http://namingschemes.com/\r\n\r\nSuggestions:\r\n* [bunnies](http://namingschemes.com/Bunnies)\r\n* [flowers](http://namingschemes.com/Flowers)\r\n* [gemstones](http://namingschemes.com/Gemstones)\r\n* [ciphers](http://namingschemes.com/Ciphers)\r\n* [coffee](http://namingschemes.com/Coffee)\r\n* [scientists](http://namingschemes.com/Scientists)\r\n* [japanese food](http://namingschemes.com/Japanese_Food)\r\n* [nerves](http://namingschemes.com/Nerves)\r\n* [dragons](http://namingschemes.com/Dragons)\r\n* [Famous traitors](http://namingschemes.com/Famous_Traitors)\r\n\r\nI also propose this be a release blocker, so that no more boring server names are released into the wild.\r\n"
