        "Instead of `<hostname>_<random_letters>`, we should pick some interesting names. I understand violent stuff is out, but that doesn't mean it needs to be bland random letters.\n\nThere are plenty off good names on here: http://namingschemes.com/\n\nSuggestions:\n- [bunnies](http://namingschemes.com/Bunnies)\n- [flowers](http://namingschemes.com/Flowers)\n- [gemstones](http://namingschemes.com/Gemstones)\n- [ciphers](http://namingschemes.com/Ciphers)\n- [coffee](http://namingschemes.com/Coffee)\n- [scientists](http://namingschemes.com/Scientists)\n- [japanese food](http://namingschemes.com/Japanese_Food)\n- [nerves](http://namingschemes.com/Nerves)\n- [dragons](http://namingschemes.com/Dragons)\n- [Famous traitors](http://namingschemes.com/Famous_Traitors)\n\nI also propose this be a release blocker, so that no more boring server names are released into the wild.\n"
