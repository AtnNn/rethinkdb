      "@deontologician Ok, I think we should implement these changes in the web UI if we want to keep the format of the `table_status` document unchanged:\r\n* for the replication progress, we should ignore `\"erasing_data\"` replicas\r\n* the \"Redundancy\" monitor in the Dashboard as well as \"Tables X/X ready\" in the top bar (next to Connected to, Issues, Servers) should ignore those as well. I think \"Tables ready\" should use `ready_for_writes`.\r\n* on the page for a specific table, we also show the \"X/Y replicas reachable\" metric. This should also ignore \"erasing_data\" replicas if it doesn't already.\r\n\r\nDoes that sound reasonable?"
