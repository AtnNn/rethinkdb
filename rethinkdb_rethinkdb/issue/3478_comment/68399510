      "@Tryneus\r\nI like `config_satisfied`.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there could still be a use for a status analogue to what @VeXocide said the `all_replicas_ready` status should mean. But it's probably not that important.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus thanks for the clarification of the transitioning process. I think it can currently misbehave because of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3480 , but that's a separate issue.\r\n\r\nSo since `\"erasing_data\"` is never something that we need to wait on for a table, I actually think it wouldn't be too bad to just take it out of table_status altogether. Thoughts on that?"
