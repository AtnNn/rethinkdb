      "@danielmewes, here are some suggestions for renaming `all_replicas_ready`:\r\n* `stable` - may be a bit misleading, as we're talking about the stability of the states, not cluster stability\r\n* `config_satisfied` / `config_fulfilled` / `config_achieved` / `config_reached` - these sound a bit weird, but should be clearer\r\n* `steady_state` / `stable_state` - a bit of a compromise, they sound fine but probably still not self-explanatory enough\r\n\r\n>  If a server starts erasing data for a range [a, b) and then we change the configuration to make it a secondary for an overlapping range [a', b'), which state will the secondary show up as while it's waiting for the erase to finish?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand your question - if the configuration is changed, it doesn't wait for the erase to finish, the existing reactor is interrupted and it will exit the erase early.  The new reactor should be a secondary, so it would show up as `transitioning`, `backfilling_data`, `looking_for_primary_replica`, or `ready`, depending on the tasks it needs to perform."
