      "@timmaxw \r\nSince `N` is about the \"goal\" number of replicas, I'd say it's fine from a semantic perspective that the web UI (or a user) has to go to the `table_config` table to obtain that information. If users complain we could still add back the `role` field later. I don't have a strong opinion either way though.\r\n\r\n@deontologician Thanks for the query. I don't see anything obviously wrong with it, but will run a few tests to reproduce the inconsistency and see what happens. I'll let you know via Slack so we don't mix more stuff into this issue (I originally thought it might be related, but probably isn't)."
