      "Note that a user could then still wait for the reconfigure to finish, with the one exception of `erasing_data` replicas.\r\nI think that's fine though, because it's pretty arbitrary in the first place that this is considered part of the reconfiguration.\r\nIgnoring the knowledge about the internal clustering architecture with its reactors, I think from a user's point of view the erasing data step is no more connected to applying the configuration than is garbage collection."
