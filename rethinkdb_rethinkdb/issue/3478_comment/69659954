      "I originally asked to remove the `role` field because the wording was very confusing. For example, what does it mean to have `{role: 'nothing'}`? (I know what it means, but to a user, it's very confusing when this shows up)\r\n\r\nI think with a few changes in wording, this could be a helpful field. I propose the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ goal: 'become_replica' }\r\n{ goal: 'become_primary_replica' }\r\n{ goal: 'recuse_responsibilities' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would drop the `goal` field entirely when the goal is satisfied -- this would be a transient field that shows up when the replica is in a process of transition.\r\n\r\nNote, I don't think this is particularly important to add, but I'm not opposed to adding it."
