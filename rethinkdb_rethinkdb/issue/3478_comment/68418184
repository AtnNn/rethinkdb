      "@deontologician: The \"primary replicas reachable\" text could equivalently use:\r\n```\r\ntable_status.get(id)(\"shards\").count(r.row('primary_replica').ne(null))\r\n```\r\n\r\n@danielmewes: I would be OK with showing replicas that are in the `offloading_data` state but not showing replicas that are in the `erasing_data` state.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should put the `role` field back into `table_status` because that way the web UI wouldn't have to cross-reference `table_status` and `table_config`.
