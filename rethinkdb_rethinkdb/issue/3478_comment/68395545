      "Currently, the webui uses \"all_replicas_ready\" to mean \"there's no more ready status than this one\". We show it directly on the table page.\r\n\r\nThe progress bar for reconfiguration checks shard status though, and it checks whether the status field is \"ready\". So it's possible for the page to say Ready at the top, and the progress bar to be there and not complete."
