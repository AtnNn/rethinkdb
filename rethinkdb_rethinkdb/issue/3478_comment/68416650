      "Small correction: The web UI currently lists tables in state 2 as \"Outdated reads\". I think that's fine too.\r\n\r\nHowever different from my suggestion, I think it might actually look more consistent if we either always show the A/N number next to the status, or otherwise to show them only in states 4 and 5 in parentheses, but not in states 6 and 7. That is:\r\n1. Unavailable\r\n2. Outdated reads\r\n3. Reads only\r\n4. Ready (A/N)\r\n5. Ready (A/N)\r\n6. Ready\r\n7. Ready"
