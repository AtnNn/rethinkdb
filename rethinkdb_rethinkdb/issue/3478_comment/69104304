      "Ok, let's do this:\r\n* hide `erasing_data` replicas from the `replicas` lists\r\n* make `all_replicas_ready` ignore `erasing_data` replicas as well\r\n\r\nI'm also generally on board with adding the `role` field back to the replicas in `table_status`. What would its values be? \"nothing\", \"primary replica\", \"secondary replica\"?\r\nIt seems that the `role` field was removed as part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3064#issue-42936490 ? In that case I would like to wait on @coffeemug 's opinion regarding adding it back."
