      "OK, so I was under the impression the replica was able to answer requests even if it was erasing data. If that's not the case, then I think we should consider the \"erasing_data\" status as not ready in the UI and in progressbars (i.e. leave everything as it is).\r\n\r\nIf the replica can handle requests, but may be slowed down because of the erasing, then I think it shouldn't be part of the status."
