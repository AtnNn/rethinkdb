      "@timmaxw, I think a replica can only be in the state `erasing_data` if its role is `nothing` - so it should be fine to omit from the replicas (as long as the task is represented in the `jobs` table).  In addition, we would redefine `all_replicas_ready` to ignore `nothing` roles, or it would be slightly confusing why a table wasn't ready yet."
