      "Ping @timmaxw @Tryneus @deontologician @coffeemug \r\n\r\nWhen @VeXocide told me about this I first thought we should definitely change this, but now looking at the full `table_status` document, it sort of makes sense for `all_replicas_ready` to mean that all entries in `shards[].replicas` have a `state` of exactly `\"ready\"`.\r\n\r\nWe might want to make the web UI ignore replicas that are `\"erasing_data\"` though. @deontologician how does the web UI currently interpret and use table readyness? I remember we had a longer discussion (with @timmaxw ) about how readyness is displayed on the tables tab, but I forgot what exactly we ended up with."
