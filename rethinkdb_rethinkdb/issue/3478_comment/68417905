      "> During a backfill, servers in the nothing state may still be storing critical data.\r\n\r\nOh true. What if we hide only those that are in the \"erasing_data\" state as originally proposed?\r\nThat would still require the web UI to go to `table_config` for getting the number of desired replicas (to compute N), but it would avoid the confusion about `all_replicas_ready`."
