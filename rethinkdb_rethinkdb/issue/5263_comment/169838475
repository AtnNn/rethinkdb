      "@zopyx thanks for the report, especially for putting it in the form of a script I can run to investigate with. However, I am not able to reproduce the error thus far... I am running v2.2.2, but using a `scroot` CentoOS 7.0 image rather than a full version of the OS. I don't think that that should make a difference, but I could be wrong about that.\r\n\r\nHowever could you check a couple of things for me, just so that I can make sure we have the exact same environment? If you could provide the output from these commands that might help me nail what is going on here:\r\n```\r\nuname -a\r\nrethinkdb --version\r\npython2.7 -c 'import rethinkdb; print(rethinkdb.version)'\r\n```"
