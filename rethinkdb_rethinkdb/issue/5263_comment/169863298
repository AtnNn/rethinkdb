      "@larkost Yes that's true. There appears to be an issue with the error printing.\r\n\r\nIn a quick test on Python 2.7.3 and the latest Python driver this is working fine for me with `ReqlOpFailedError`s.\r\n\r\nI wonder if printing the exception message is just taking a really long time, since the query is so large.\r\nThe output looks like this:\r\n```\r\nrethinkdb.errors.ReqlOpFailedError: Cannot perform read: The primary replica isn't connected to a quorum of replicas. The read was not performed, you can do an outdated read using `read_mode=\"outdated\"` in:\r\nr.table('t1')\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\nNote that it includes a printout of the query itself, which in this case will contain all of `rows`."
