      "For the query and data from #3703 each worker uses 30-50 MB of RAM.\r\n\r\nThat's up to 400 MB on an 8 core server, which is very significant. On a small server with fewer cores the effect is much less severe however, and most servers with little RAM will also have few CPU cores (though that's not always true in virtualized environments)."
