      "Daniel,\r\n   I am starting the rethinkDB instance using the service.\r\n(As an aside, I have used RethinkDB very successfully for some time now on Debian.)\r\nThe machine did not run out of RAM.  It has 32 logical cores and 256 GB RAM.  It did not run out of disc space.  No other users were on the machine.  No quota issues.  I can attach a log file if that helps, but it did not show me anything useful.  \r\n\r\nI wrote some custom code to trace the system while inserting documents.  Here is a trace showing the memory and load average.  The memory consumption of 69GB before crash is fine because we allocated 220GB to RethinkDB to use for data cache.  The latest crash happened on 4-Aug at 1:10AM.\r\n\r\nI will add some additional files.\r\n\r\nn:      12806, Now:  Thu Aug  4 01:10:08 MDT 2016, Num RethinkDB processes:  3, memory used:  69052, loadavg:  2.14,\r\nn:      12807, Now:  Thu Aug  4 01:10:11 MDT 2016, Num RethinkDB processes:  3, memory used:  69057, loadavg:  2.21,\r\nn:      12808, Now:  Thu Aug  4 01:10:14 MDT 2016, Num RethinkDB processes:  3, memory used:  69062, loadavg:  2.21,\r\n**n:      12809, Now:  Thu Aug  4 01:10:17 MDT 2016, Num RethinkDB processes:  0, memory used:  7753, loadavg:  2.04,**\r\nn:      12810, Now:  Thu Aug  4 01:10:20 MDT 2016, Num RethinkDB processes:  0, memory used:  7753, loadavg:  2.03,\r\nn:      12811, Now:  Thu Aug  4 01:10:23 MDT 2016, Num RethinkDB processes:  0, memory used:  7751, loadavg:  2.03,\r\n\r\n"
