      "Hi @mbrady76, not seeing any trace at all is very weird. How are you starting the RethinkDB server? Through the init script or manually?\r\n\r\nIs it possible that the machine ran out of RAM? (though in that case, there should be messages from the OOM handler in `dmesg`).\r\nAlso, if you haven't done so already, can you double-check that there is free disk space available on the server and that there are no quotas that restrict the `rethinkdb` user from writing more data?\r\n\r\nDoes the `log_file` show anything at all when the crash happens?\r\n\r\nDo you have any insights on what might trigger the crash, or how to reproduce it?"
