      "Daniel,\r\n    To summarize, I agree with your statements.   I've been doing professional software development for well over 10 years.  Mostly Python, and C, but some C++.  I rarely see applications simply crash like this without a message in the log(s).  I've scoured the system for any obvious clues and I don't see any.  \r\n\r\nI am willing to run debug code to try and get to the bottom of it.  \r\n\r\nAny help you can provide would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike\r\n\r\n"
