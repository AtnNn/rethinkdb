      "I would like to argue for always using `--squash` merges when checking into main branches (e.g.: `next` or `v2.1.x`). This would largely eliminate this type of problem since the merge commit would presumably be labeled with the github issue that it was checked in to address. The messy in-flight commit messages then have a lot more context since they are in their own branch. I have been using this method for some time now.\r\n\r\nThe usual argument against doing this is the one around `bisect`, but as someone who does that fairly often I actually think it improves it in most cases. I generally don't care about the specific checkin that caused the problem, but rather am looking for the reasoning behind why that change was made. So from `next` I would rather be led to the github issue, and the implicit conversation around the issue, then the direct commit for that line of code. If the individual commit is worthwhile, then I can still go into the branch where development was done and `bisect` there.\r\n\r\nI also like this workflow because it gives me one last chance to make sure that I have vetted every single line of change relative to where `next` is now. I often get into merge conflicts (nature of the testing system), and having that last clean step to review everything against exactly where it is going really reassures me."
