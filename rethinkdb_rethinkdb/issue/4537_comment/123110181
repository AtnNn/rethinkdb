      "I like the idea of using `merge --squash`. That should make the commit history on the main branch much easier to follow.\r\nLet's do that!\r\n\r\nMaking the first line short and then having details after an empty line also sounds good. We should try to do that when possible.\r\n\r\n(mentioning the relevant people who haven't commented here yet so everyone is aware of this: @Tryneus, @VeXocide, @AtnNn)"
