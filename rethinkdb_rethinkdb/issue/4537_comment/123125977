      "Good point @mlucy. I didn't mean to set an absolute rule about this.\r\nCertainly this shouldn't apply to long-running branches like `raft` (though it probably should have applied to the sub-branches that were merged into `raft` before `raft` got merged into `next`).\r\n\r\nRevised non-rule: Please use `git merge --squash` where reasonable (usually small- to medium-size changes), and otherwise perform reasonable cleanup in the branch itself, followed by a regular merge."
