      "Hi @rasapetter . Thanks for the great comments.\r\n\r\nI think this is less a problem with pull requests rather than with our internal developing process at the company behind RethinkDB.\r\n\r\nKeeping the commit log tidy is not a major priority at the moment, since we use GitHub issues together with branches and (internal) code reviews to keep track of when features and fixes are added to the main branch.\r\nWe generally try to make every commit at least compile to make `git bisect` more useful, but not all of us (including myself) clean up the commit log before merging a branch. Doing so can also be dangerous sometimes because amending the commit history requires the use of `push --force` which can easily go wrong if the configuration isn't right or one is in the wrong branch.\r\n\r\nI'll keep this open for some later discussion, but I don't think we're going to drastically change this in the short term."
