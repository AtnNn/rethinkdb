      "I find it extremely helpful to have intermediate commits when bisecting, especially for large branches.  I think that squashing all commits in branches together when we merge into next would be bad.  (We have some branches that are outstanding for months at a time and build up a lot of changes.)  I wouldn't being opposed to having a rule that all commits need to compile, and squashing down commits that don't.  (I usually try to do this in my own branches but I sometimes miss some.)\r\n\r\nI think long commit messages and commits like \"merged\" are fine.  Commits like \"bugfixes\" should probably be merged into the commit before them."
