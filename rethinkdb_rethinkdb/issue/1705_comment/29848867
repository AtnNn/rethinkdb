      "@coffeemug -- this is a data loss issue, so I would put it into 1.11.x and get someone who understands the on-disk format to look at it.  It may turn out that we can't isolate it from looking out the data files, in which case I would either close or move this into backlog and open a new issue to write a cluster test for this case and see if we can reproduce it internally."
