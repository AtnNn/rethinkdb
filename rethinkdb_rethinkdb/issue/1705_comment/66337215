      "This might be the same issue @deontologician and @timmaxw  have been seeing in ReQL admin with distribution queries being performed as outdated reads.\r\n\r\n@timmaxw mentioned we could make the distribution query use up-to-date reads by default, unless outdated_ok is explicitly specified on the table. The web UI would first try to use an up-to-date read and only if that fails would fall back to an outdated one.\r\n\r\nMoving to reql-admin-polish."
