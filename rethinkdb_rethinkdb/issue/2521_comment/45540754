      "It's possible this happened because I used a different Ruby version.  The tests pass on newton, which has Ruby 2.0.0.  The version of Ruby that I ran was probably 1.9.3, which is what comes with Wheezy.  RethinkDB's website doesn't say anything about dropping support for old Ruby versions though."
