        "I just talked to some folks who are using Rethink with a Python client. At some point they added some multiprocessing, and started getting weird issues. After a while, they had a hunch that connections may not be thread safe, so they started opening a connection per thread. That fixed things for them.\r\n\r\nSo the obvious question here is whether connections should be thread safe. If not, we need to add better documentation (but I think we should answer this question first). I'd like to see what the state of the art on this is for other NoSQL systems."
