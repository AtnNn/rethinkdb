      "> Do you know which issues we should follow to stay up-to-date with the official proposals?\r\n\r\nI just created a private repo on GitHub where all discussion and development will take place. We've dedicated three engineers on the RethinkDB team (@deontologician, @dalanmiller, and @Tryneus) to work on the project, with the rest of the RethinkDB engineers advising on all design decisions.\r\n\r\nOnce we get to a point where we can release the project to the public, it will be released under an open-source license (likely MIT/Apache), and all development will be done in the open with the community just like RethinkDB. The reason we're running a closed development process until we get to v0.1 is that early stages of project development are the most special and vulnerable, and we felt it's important to temporarily limit the number of voices to help ensure success of the project.\r\n\r\nOur community team created a co-designer program, and we'll be inviting some of the most active community members to the private github repo to help shape the project while it's at this vulnerable stage. If you'd like to participate in the design process, fill this out and we'll see if we can add you to the repo:\r\n\r\n- https://horizon.io\r\n\r\nI'm really excited to get this out -- I think it will be amazing. The design process is a ton of fun, but waiting six weeks until we can release it is torture :smile: "
