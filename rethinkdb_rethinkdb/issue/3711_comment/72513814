      "Hi @pilwon, that's an interesting suggestion.\r\n\r\nI think we're going to concentrate on ReQL for the time being (and possibly add graph features, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3142), but embedding another query language will eventually become an interesting option.\r\n\r\nI wonder if we could add RethinkDB support to React independently of supporting GraphQL. That would be one for @deontologician , I haven't looked into it at all yet.\r\nAnother option might be a client-side \"wrapper\" library that translates GraphQL queries into ReQL."
