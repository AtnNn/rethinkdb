      "Hey guys, we had an unexpected level of interest in this project. We're starting to open the developer preview for Horizon (though it's still early.)\r\n\r\n__You can sign up for Horizon here:__ https://horizon.io\r\n\r\nJoin us in [#horizon on Slack](http://slack.rethinkdb.com) if you have questions.\r\n\r\nI'd like to keep the volume of traffic on this conversation minimal for existing participants, so I'm going to lock this conversation for the next few weeks to collaborators. I'll unlock it as Horizon nears general availability. \r\n\r\nWe'll post updates as they come -- thanks for your patience!"
