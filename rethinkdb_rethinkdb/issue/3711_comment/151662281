      "I've been using [rethinkdb-websocket-server](https://github.com/mikemintz/rethinkdb-websocket-server) with [rethinkdb-websocket-client](https://github.com/mikemintz/rethinkdb-websocket-client) which provide a websocket proxy over a rethinkdb connection. If I've understood correctly your plan is to add a baked in version of this, if that's the case then it sounds great!\r\n\r\nCurious to see what you're going to do with the security model, [rethinkdb-websocket-server](https://github.com/mikemintz/rethinkdb-websocket-server) is a node server that you can extend with custom logic to approve/deny access to queries. Maybe a rethinkdb plugin would make sense for this?\r\n\r\n"
