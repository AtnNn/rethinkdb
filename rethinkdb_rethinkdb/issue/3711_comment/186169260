      "Meteor development group (MDG) is doing some interesting work concerning this topic: https://github.com/apollostack/apollo\r\nThey make a javascript stack for realtime data subscriptions using GraphQL. Would it be a possibility to work together with them and implement a [Data driver](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo/blob/master/design/high-level-reactivity.md#data-drivers) so that we can do realtime GraphQL queries to rethinkDB via Apollo?\r\n\r\nMDG is probably going to implement this technology incrementally and won't have a \"true\" realtime implementation from the beginning because they will use databases (Mongo etc) that don't have \"realtime query\" features like RethinkDB out of the box. So maybe it's interesting if rethinkDB will have the first realtime data driver for apollo."
