      "@pilwon, @Agamennon Isn't what you really want an adapter for GraphQL that sits on top of RethinkDB? Would this be a project be outside the scope of the database? You can't, for example, query RethinkDB from the client (and you probably don't want to either) and GraphQL would always be queried from the client."
