      "> There's also no way (nor should there be) for RethinkDB to \"fall through\" to other systems in the case where your system evolves to the point that multiple backend services are necessary.\r\n\r\n@leebyron flipping this around, is GraphQL composable in any way? i.e. is it possible to configure a GraphQL server to read the schemas from and act as a proxy to other GraphQL endpoints?"
