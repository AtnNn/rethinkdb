      "@ide thanks for the quick response! I completely agree with your perspective on this, especially with regards to using changefeeds as a backing for GraphQL subscriptions. In my opinion, RethinkDB is one of the best tools available for this kind of project, in a major way due to RQL's expressiveness and composibility.\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to start work on a GraphQL-to-RQL library, I'd be more than happy to contribute when I can!"
