      "> @leebyron flipping this around, is GraphQL composable in any way? i.e. is it possible to configure a GraphQL server to read the schemas from and act as a proxy to other GraphQL endpoints?\r\n\r\nGraphQL is as composable as your programming language allows! You could absolutely call other GraphQL endpoints from a GraphQL server. I don't think I've seen this actually done before, but there's no reason it couldn't be done."
