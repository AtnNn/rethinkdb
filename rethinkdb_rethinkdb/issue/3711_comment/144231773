      "@pbowyer -- good question :smile: I actually spoke to the Netflix team that's building Falcor, and we do in fact have plans to build a Falcor plugin. I don't think there is an issue for it in the tracker, but the idea behind the plugin system is to allow support for a wide range of data protocols, and let the users pick whichever protocol makes the most sense for them."
