      "I should say the important reason for why this is the case and why I think it's not reasonable for RethinkDB to do this is that GraphQL is a way to write a mapping from field names to arbitrary functions in your programming language of choice. You can think of it as a sort of nested RPC. In contrast RethinkDB, like other DBs are not mappings to arbitrary logic but to specific storage engines. GraphQL was not designed to map directly against a storage engine in this way."
