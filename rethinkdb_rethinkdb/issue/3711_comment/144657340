      "First of all, this sounds like an exciting direction for rethinkdb. \r\n\r\nSomething that I haven't  seen mentioned yet is how changefeeds will be exposed. I haven't seen this tackled anywhere with regards to GraphQL. Assuming updates were sent over a websocket, what might they look like? \r\n\r\nSeeing as the results of GraphQL queries are json structures perhaps JSON-Patch could be a good fit? (related to https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3575)\r\n\r\nThe challenge I see though is that GraphQL results don't require ids to be included with embedded types so addressing the correct point in the graph would require json paths that include array indexes which doesn't seem robust enough.\r\n\r\nEDIT: The other option would be a json diff, this suffers the same problem though, you're still dependent on index position to target changes to the correct part of the json."
