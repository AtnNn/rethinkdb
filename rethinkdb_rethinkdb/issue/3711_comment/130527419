      "@coffeemug It's great that you see this as a tremendous growth opportunity as well! :+1:\r\n\r\nFor user's perspective, `Option 2` is no doubt the most compelling option, however I feel `Option 1` is (almost) as good as `Option 2`. You just need to show React developers how easy and fun it is to play with `r.graphql` in the data explorer. Building a backend is not a major burden if you also provide a rdb wrapper for [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql) (officially supported by FB).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, officially shipping an adapter (`Option 3` or `Option 4`) may not bring the result you'd expect. There will most likely be tons of other open source projects doing that for a wide variety of databases so it probably won't be easy to stand out even with a first-mover advantage. It might be better to just leave it up to the community."
