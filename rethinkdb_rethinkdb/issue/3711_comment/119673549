      "So this is what Facebook is selling, you have a relay store that talks to a Graphql server, relay assembles the query to the Graphql server that can answer that request accordingly, now why do i believe rethink could profit from this? my answer is two fold:\r\n\r\n1: Graphql on its own, is a much better way to query data from the server then thinking about the exact structure of how the data is stored on the server, in practice you never use tables or other \"sql like\" abstractions, what you want is just a specific Json, so Graphql on its own, even when not coupled with Ralay or other React fluff, stands on its own.\r\n\r\n2: By having an internal implementation of Graphql, Rethinkdb could optimize and do other stuff that drivers would need to do, and do that inside the server without back and forth information being exchanged with a potential rethink-graphql server driver, and they can only do that by inferring on the structure of the user data, and requiring the user to probably provide some mappings (this last part might be inevitable)\r\n\r\nSo, IMHO, Graphql should be taken seriously! rethinkdb would profit tremendously, as querying data from it would be intuitive to web developers, the old ways of writing backed code is over, rest or rpc specific code, is probably going to be obsolete, lets adjust accordingly."
