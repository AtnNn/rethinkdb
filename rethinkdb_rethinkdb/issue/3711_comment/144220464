      "@pbowyer as @coffeemug mentioned above, GraphQL support won't be baked in:\r\n\r\n> Roughly, our current plan is as follows (though it may evolve as we get deeper into the implementation):\r\n> \r\n> - Add an extension architecture to RethinkDB that implements a minimum possible featureset to make extensions useful.\r\n> - Build a GraphQL extension that will ship with RethinkDB out of the box.\r\n\r\nSo while there will be an *official* GraphQL plugin, the extension system should allow you to write a Falcor (or any other third-party) integration in much the same way."
