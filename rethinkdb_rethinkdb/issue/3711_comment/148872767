      "@freiksenet Great idea to come up with a common spec. I need to look into the details of this a bit more. Thanks for the writeup!\r\n\r\n@mquandalle Very interesting post indeed. Thanks for sharing.\r\n\r\nMany of the requirements they describe about the live-query complications happen to be solvable for changefeeds by using changefeeds on table joins (#3997) and on aggregations (#1118).\r\nWe have some plans for both of those, so live queries / changefeeds might actually become feasible for a lot of additional queries, including some really complex ones."
