      "Just one point of input on this.. would suggest to someone building a JS extension for this to support template based query injection for any JS interface...   \r\n\r\n    var result = await (r.graphql`\r\n      {\r\n        user(id: ${userId}) {\r\n          name\r\n          age\r\n          friends {\r\n            name\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    `)\r\n\r\nThis would make it more natural to deal with query injection.. yes it's a new feature of JS, and would require babel for most people, it would still be a good idea.  Why this isn't a part of the spec, I don't know."
