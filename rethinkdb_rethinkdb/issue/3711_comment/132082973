      "I'd like to echo the sentiment that RethinkDB could be a really good fit for Relay in particular because of your support for realtime queries.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug - my inclination is that Option 3 (library) leading towards Option 1 (engine support) is a good path forward. There are many GraphQL queries that don't map to ReQL in an obvious way (ex: \"get me this person's posts... that I'm allowed to see\" -- the privacy constraint is implicit and GraphQL has the notion of the current user but ReQL doesn't), which is why I believe it's so important to have a library that lets us implement parts of a GraphQL query with our own code that calls into RethinkDB. Native support for GraphQL is a nice optimization underneath that. I would strongly advise against Option 2 because of the security issue you brought up... you really want complex security and privacy logic to live in the application layer."
