      "@mike-marcacci great writeup. Agreed that we want to have a high ceiling that supports building real applications beyond demos. There are a handful of very (overly?) client-centric frameworks/services that make it easy to get started but hard to evolve as you mention. In that vein, automatically exposing RethinkDB documents via GraphQL could demo very well and be great for marketing but not be what you actually want for professional work. GraphQL is generally not intended to have a direct connection to RethinkDB or MySQL or any other traditional database (that said, it would be sweet for a DB admin tool where you do want a direct view of the database).\r\n\r\nWhere I believe RethinkDB can help is providing core features and helper libraries that make it easier for developers to build a GraphQL layer on top of it. I totally agree with your sentiment when you wrote, \"The RethinkDb team could instead focus on implementing general-purpose features like transactions, schemas and document edges/relationships that would make writing a GraphQL plugin/library easier and more performant.\" We'll have to build apps with RethinkDB and GraphQL to learn what those general-purpose features are.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm still excited by the prospect of using RethinkDB's changefeeds to power live GraphQL subscriptions =)"
