      "@ide -- cool, thanks for the feedback. Do you have an example of how to do security with GraphQL you could point me to? I couldn't find anything online (other than a vague \"do it yourself\").\r\n\r\nWouldn't the developer have to analyze every GraphQL query themselves to do security? That sounds like a huge burden, and it feels strange that security provisions aren't in the spec. I feel like I'm missing something, but I can't seem to find any information on this."
