      "I second @mike-marcacci's reservations about directly bundling one or more arbitrary additional query languages. The comment from @coffeemug about containing these in a plugin architecture is reassuring.\r\n\r\nAs someone very interested in [Falcor](https://netflix.github.io/falcor/) as mentioned upthread, is there room for a more general ticket about supporting graph query languages? (Apologies if one has already been linked). Things like @freiksenet's writeup would be very relevant to that conversation.\r\n\r\nThe comments in this thread implying a concentration on the support capability first, then language-specific plugins second, make me a lot less nervous about this."
