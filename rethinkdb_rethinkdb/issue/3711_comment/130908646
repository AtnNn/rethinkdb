      "@coffeemug and others, I'd like to say that the attitude I'm seeing here in this thread is one of the reasons why I'm building my product on top of RethinkDB even though it's not a market leader and even though it does not have support for Windows yet. You guys really care for innovation and promptly adopting new technologies that look promising, for the sake of progress. This is what technology is all about. Thanks everyone for your energy. RethinkDB rocks because of you."
