I'm really excited and curious about some of these new ideas (especially the security model) but I don't want to take this thread too off-topic with all my new questions :)\r\n\r\nI know there are several community-submitted issues/suggestions regarding these great new features: do you know which issues we should follow to stay up-to-date with the official proposals?"
