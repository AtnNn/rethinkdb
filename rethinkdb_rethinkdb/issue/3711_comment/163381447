      "@danielmewes sounds interesting and would love to talk with you guys more about it. I am curious around the write and subscribe areas especially. With recent progress on subscriptions in relay as well, and your general approach implementing the various features (read, write, subscribe).\r\n\r\nEdit: will add I'm working on something that I'd love to test this with, and would be honored to join the Fusion discussion."
