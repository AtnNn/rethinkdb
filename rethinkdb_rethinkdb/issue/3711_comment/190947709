      "All -- quick update.\r\n\r\nThe project is moving along and we settled on the name `horizon`. Our target ship date for Horizon beta is April 15th. We're very excited about this project because it will make building advanced, modern apps dramatically easier.\r\n\r\nThe first version will not have GraphQL support, but Horizon was designed with GraphQL in mind, so we should be able to follow up with a GraphQL adapter pretty quickly (possibly in the next version after launch, depending on the feature list).\r\n\r\nWe will likely open up the GitHub project before the launch date -- we're currently working on a security model/implementation, and once that lands we'll open source everything and make it generally available.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for your support -- we're super excited about shipping this! (the first 90% is done, we're now working on the last 90% :smile: )"
