      "Unfortunately I wasn't able to reproduce this problem @kulbirsaini. There is a set of tests for this which pass and when manually checking `dryRun` it behaved as expected as well. When using `dryRun` the returned object should have `\"repaired\": 0` instead of `\"repaired\": 1`, and the changes should obviously not be applied.\r\n\r\nI'll be closing the issue since I can't reproduce it, but if you have any further information please feel free to reopen it."
