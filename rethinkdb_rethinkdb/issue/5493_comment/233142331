      "Restarting the proxy fixed the problem, thanks. Its possible db2 was not running when the proxy was started. I assumed the proxy would discover new nodes via its connection to db1. Also from the docs I saw --join [host] implying only one host can be specified, if --join can/should be used more than once, that'd be nice to note in the command line help."
