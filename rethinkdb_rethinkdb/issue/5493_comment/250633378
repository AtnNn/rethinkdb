      "Several things to ensure that discovery works:\r\n- Keep in mind that other last server that is online will initiate the connection to your proxy, NOT proxy that initiated the connection to the cluster if there is new instance in the cluster after the proxy is started.\r\n- Make sure you have the proxy bound to the address that others will connect to.\r\n- Make sure that network access inbound access is allowed in your firewall/security group.\r\n- Whenever possible specify the canonical address, this address is your proxy address which other instances will connect to."
