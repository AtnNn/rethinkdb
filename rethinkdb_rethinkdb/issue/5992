        "To support some permission work in #5692 we need to make the YAML tests more aware of users. After some conversation in the office this morning here is what we have settled on:\r\n\r\n- setup an additional (to the built-in `admin`) user for every server. The working name is `test_user`, but better suggestions are welcome.\r\n- allow for an optional entry in `runopts` for each line named `user` that when set to this name would use a connection established (at test-startup) as that user\r\n- user(s) would be made admins with full privileges\r\n- clean/reset the server permissions between tests (as part of the `clean` operation)\r\n- optionally have `users` and `default_user` options at the top of the YAML file to create a list of users and set a default user to prevent some tests from having to have a user set in every test line"
