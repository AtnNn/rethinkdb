      "So the reason it's probably like this is because the underlying rawSocket does emit the errors. The reason the second version works is because we re-emit socket errors on the parent object (see [line 1219 in net.coffee](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/javascript/net.coffee#L1219). Since it's hard to track which order these handlers are executed in, it may be preferable to do it @kvnvelasco 's way.\r\n\r\n@kvnvelasco under what circumstances are you getting an exception here? This code as-is seems like it should work to me"
