      "`LEGACY_LINUX` is supposed to disable the timerfd provider, and quick check shows that the compilation flag does that.  The line number in the output should not even be compiled -- the body of timerfd_provider.cc is conditionally compiled away.\r\n\r\n@dulac - I think your problem is that you tried running rethinkdb with the command `rethinkdb`, which will run the globally installed rethinkdb executable unless \".\" is part of your PATH environment variable.  Try running `./rethinkdb`."
