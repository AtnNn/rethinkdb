      "@dulac - Could you run this C program on that system, and tell us what its output is, to help diagnose the problem?\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include <errno.h>\r\n#include <sys/timerfd.h>\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    int res = timerfd_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, 0);\r\n    int errsv = errno;\r\n    printf(\"timerfd_create returned %d, errno = %d\\n\", res, errsv);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave the code to a file `foo.c`, run `gcc foo.c -o foo`, and then run `./foo` to run the program.\r\n\r\n~~It also might be in your best interest to run memtest86+ or some other memory testing software on the system (if you're not sure it's running on top of ECC RAM).~~\r\n\r\nRight now, as far as we can tell, everything works fine on two of our 64-bit Ubuntu Server 12.04.1 systems, one of which was just freshly installed (`3.2.0-29-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 27 17:03:23 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`).  ~~So there is presumably some hardware difference that makes your system behave differently, and bad RAM is one likely culprit.~~\r\n\r\nEdit: The kernel version is too old.\r\n\r\n"
