      "What's rather disturbing is that when running rethinkdb, you should still get the ENOSYS error code, but instead we got zero.  But in the simple program we got ENOSYS (which is 38) as the errno value.\r\n\r\n@dulac - If you want to run RethinkDB on that machine, you could update your source to the latest version of rethinkdb on github and rebuild with `make clean && make DEBUG=0 LEGACY_LINUX=1`, which will use a different timer provider and avoid some other features available only on later linux kernels."
