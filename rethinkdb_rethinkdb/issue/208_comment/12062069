      "Thank you for submitting this report.  It's particularly peculiar because the output you've listed implies that the `timerfd_create` system call is failing without setting `errno` to a non-zero error code.  The documentation says this can't happen, so this means one of several things:\r\n\r\n- There is a bug in the kernel (or userland libraries), or\r\n- ~~Our error-reporting code is not handling the errno value properly, or~~\r\n- Some kind of memory corruption bug is manifesting itself oddly, or\r\n- (By process of elimination) your machine's hardware is glitchy?\r\n\r\nI'm going to double check our error-reporting code and maybe think of what other information might be useful."
