      "Will there still be a way to define split points manually through a lower-level API?\r\n\r\nI think there are some use cases where you want control about which keys end up where. For example imagine you store user data, and your users are in different locations. With manual split points, you can generate primary keys such that users from a certain location end up on servers in a data center close to them.\r\n\r\n(Edit: Also sorry I'm only commenting now, 10 days after the thing was proposed)"
