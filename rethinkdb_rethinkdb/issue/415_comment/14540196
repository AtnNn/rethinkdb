      "There was three errors\r\n- we were calling `_continue` instead of `_continueQuery` (that was throwing an error)\r\n- hasNext() was always return false\r\n- The callback passed in `query.run(connection, callback)` were called more than once (once every time we were getting results from the server).\r\n\r\nI manually tested it with the data explorer. I have not written a nice test for that.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug do you have a test for that?"
