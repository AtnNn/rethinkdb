      "Well, actually I'm overselling this quite a bit. It's just that backfilling works correctly with blocks returned in whatever order the serializer finds convenient. So that would probably already be a bit faster, and with some more optimization could request big batches of blocks and try to read them sequentially. It seems like we can only do so much here without changing the layout on disk though."
