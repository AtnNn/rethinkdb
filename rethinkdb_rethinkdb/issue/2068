It's not the most common way to create an expression, we should use `r.expr(1)`.\r\n\r\nAlso I would tend to think we should eventually drop the syntax `r()`, but that's another problem. I may open another issue later for that.\r\n\r\nNote: The same thing happens with `r.expr([r.expr(1).add(\"hello\")])`\r\n\r\nPutting in subsequent."
