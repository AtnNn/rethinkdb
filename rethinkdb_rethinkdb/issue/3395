        "Back before the new aggregation APIs were introduced, [`.groupedMapReduce()`](https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/blob/229f470d7e82300fddff216cd4d6eacfe959bcd8/api/javascript/aggregation/groupedMapReduce.md) used to take an optional `base` argument that allowed you to set the initial reduction value. Since it's been removed, I find myself having to map over all the rows before the reduction. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table('test')\r\n.map(r.object(r.row('foo'), r.row('bar')))\r\n.reduce(function (left, right) {\r\n  return left.merge(right);\r\n})\r\n```\r\n```js\r\nr.table('test')\r\n.reduce(function (left, right) {\r\n  return left.merge(r.object(right('foo'), right('bar')));\r\n}, {})\r\n```"
