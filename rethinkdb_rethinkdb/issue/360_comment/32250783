      "I've also noticed an issue with just plain table_create on the same database slowing down so if I create a new database and start to create inside it some 100 tables the last one will take considerably more time than the first one. Creating tables is not the most time critical action but such a noticeable difference would hint at some underlying scaling issue to me."
