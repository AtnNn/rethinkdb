      "> You just wait for them to send an acknowledge message to some node (it would acknowledge that the metadata update has been written to disk).\r\n\r\nNo, if all you had to do was \"just wait for them to send...\" then clustering algorithms like Raft and PAXOS wouldn't need to exist.  If you want to \"make sure\".. of this sort of thing, you need to do a clustering algorithm correctly and not roll your own thing that's broken."
