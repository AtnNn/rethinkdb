      "> You can't just do that. Clustering doesn't work this way. You have to discard old changes correctly.\r\n\r\nYou can't make sure that all members of the cluster have become aware of the deletion? How is that? You just wait for them to send an acknowledge message to some node (it would acknowledge that the metadata update has been written to disk). In the worst case you disallow new nodes to join the cluster while in that process to avoid race conditions coming from that, and there you go.\r\n\r\nI agree that old changes should be discarded correctly rather than incorrectly."
