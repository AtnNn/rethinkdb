      "@neumino: I also think we can clean them up after a while. We just have to make sure that all members of the cluster have become aware of the deletion.\r\nEssentially we can delete the `<uuid>: null` entry in the metadata as soon as all evidence of the given table ever existing has been removed, if that makes sense. ;-) In practice this probably means that the new metadata has been joined with all copies of the metadata that exist in the cluster."
