      "Hi @baruch, there were indeed some very significant inefficiencies in operations such as tableCreate, that caused it to scale very badly in the number of tables already existing on the cluster. These inefficiencies will be fixed in the 1.12 release.\r\n\r\nThere is still the problem of deleted tables having an impact on performance, as they leave traces in the metadata as described in this issue. That doesn't seem to be what you have observed in your test though."
