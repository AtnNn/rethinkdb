      "@srh: I don't know what this has to do with Raft of PAXOS. Those algorithms are there to handle cases of network partitioning and node failures. We don't have to do that here. If we have incomplete connectivity we just don't delete old entries until we regain it. It's easy to make sure that thing if it is ok for it to fail (it just must never say \"everybody knows\" if that's not the case, but it can always say \"maybe not everybody knows\". PAXOS and others don't have that luxury)."
