I've opened an issue about that (see #2030), but suppose we didn't fix that, or the user calls `reduce` or some such. Having a non-existence error, or a division by zero or anything like that on one group shouldn't blow the computation for the rest of the groups. A GMR query can run for hours and it would be very frustrating if the whole thing aborted because of a bad record.\n\nAlso `reduce` throws on non-existence -- we should think if that's what we want.\n\nThis is a 2.x sort of deal.\n"
