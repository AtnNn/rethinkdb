      "Just to make sure I understand the issue:\r\nYou mentioned in the other thread\r\n> Unfortunately, if the user doesn't catch this, it interacts poorly with Tornado, which assumes the `StopIteration` means that the coroutine has finished.\r\n\r\nIs that a special meaning of `StopIteration` in Tornado? What happens with other exceptions that the user doesn't catch? Would they also terminate the coroutine?"
