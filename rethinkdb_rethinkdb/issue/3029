        "We changed the server names to a more generic hostname + adapter + a random string in 1.14 (#236). I suggest two changes for friendliness, inspired by GitHub's suggestions for new repo names:\r\n\r\n- Instead of appending a random string, append a random selection from a list of adjectives (happy, shiny, calm, creative, tidy) -- that way the servers have some personality, and it's easier to remember what to type if you want to address a server by name.\r\n- Instead of using underscores, use hyphens -- they're easier to read. This could be bike shedding, so feel free to leave underscores if people disagree."
