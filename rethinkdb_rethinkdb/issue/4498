        "Among the most inefficient ones:\n- it causes `dummy_write_t`s that actually write a new superblock (plus at the moment they are even performed in hard durability). They also get throttled if there is heavy write load on the table.\n- it performs a noop raft transaction that I think also causes disk writes and has to acquire locks and such.\n\nThis currently makes retrieving `table_status` unacceptably slow during reconfiguration or high write loads.\n"
