        "I'm basically trying to do an inverse of `eqJoin` where the right-hand side is null. Is there an efficient way to do something like this?\n\n``` js\nr.table('diff_results').eqJoin('diff_id', r.table('diffs')).filter({ right: null })\n```\n\nUsing `filter` is proving to be rather slow. Left table contains ~1.7M docs, right table contains ~4K docs:\n\n``` js\nr.table('diff_results').filter(function (row) {\n  return r.table('diffs').get(row('diff_id')).eq(null);\n})\n```\n"
