        "I am seeing occasional table availability problems in `next` while running `./test-runner`. The problem has been showing up in every run of the entire suite (of 343 tests), but is hopping around on every run, so affects a handful of them with every test. It is a little hard to describe because it shows up a little differently every time, so I will give a few examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\n``` python\nr.db('test').table_create('test').run(conn)\nr.db('test').table('test').wait().run(conn)\n# RqlRuntimeError(u'Table `test.test` does not exist.')\n```\n\nExample 2:\n\n``` python\n# previous test drops table test.t665\n\n# test harness\nr.db('test').table_list().for_each(lambda tableName: r.db('test').table_drop(tableName)).run(conn)\n\n# new test using same server\nr.db('test').tableCreate('t665').run(conn)\n# RqlRuntimeError(u'Table `test.t665` already exists.')\n```\n\nExample 3:\n\n``` python\nr.db('test').table_create('t665').run(conn)\nr.db('test').table('t665').insert([{'id':1}, {'id':4}]).run(conn)\n# RqlRuntimeError(u'Table `test.t665` does not exist.')\n```\n\nI have cleaned up the examples a little, but mostly this is copy-paste from what the tests are doing. I have also only been running these tests locally. There have also been a number of other versions of the error, but these are three that were in one run.\n"
