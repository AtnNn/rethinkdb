        "The tests currently log by using print statements. It would be better to use the logging module and write at least our own Formatter object. This would provide the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1. We could have debug and info levels to allow for easier diagnosis when building/troubleshooting tests\r\n2. It is very easy to hijack the output streams for logging to provide notifications on STDOUT as well as log files. \r\n3. By catching the error level and worse we can now mark those as specific failures. This will be important later on when we want to have a bigger regression system.\r\n\r\nGoing farther than this, subclassing the logger would allow us to go even farther, and include things like colorized printing and artifacts with the same route."
