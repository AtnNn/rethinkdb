      "Under more extreme conditions (with 32 shards and ~800 connections per client machine, still three client machines and 8 server nodes split between 2 machines), I can only reproduce this issue when compiling on the servers at the same time. And then it only happens for a very brief period.\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of changes since the issue was opened, including changes to the message hub and how fast it can handle OS events. I think this might have been fixed as a side-effect.\r\nI'm closing this. If it pops up again, please re-open the issue."
