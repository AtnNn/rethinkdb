      "@coffeemug From what i understand one of the upcoming milestones has a lot of changes for changes() to make things better. I guess this would help it but i recommend insteed of doing this exact feature it may be better to finally do triggers so that triggers can work with changes and then small features like this would just be a custom trigger. \r\n\r\nSomething i notice with rethinkdb is that there is a cool new feature that is addeded but since rethinkdb is missing features that are found in RDBMS requestes like this come up. And then get put in to 2.0 because to the oveall project they are not imporant even though there imporant for users them selves."
