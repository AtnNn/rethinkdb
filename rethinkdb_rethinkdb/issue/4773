        "I think similar issues have been brought up before, but I just found a way to reproduce them easily:\r\n\r\nI started a server with a cache size of just 20 MB, and two large tables (a few million docs each).\r\nThe data was on an SSD.\r\nI then started running queries `r.table('table1').delete()` and `r.table('table2').delete()`.\r\n\r\nWhile the deletes were running, simple reads from those tables became extremely slow (often taking up to 15 seconds). Reads from a third table that I wasn't deleting from were still fast.\r\n\r\nWhat's even weirder though, is that access to many of the system tables also became extremely slow (multiple seconds for reading them). This included `table_config`, `table_status`, `jobs`, and even `stats`."
