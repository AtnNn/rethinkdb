      "@danielmewes I was mistaken yesterday, loading the keys upfront is actually ~4-5x faster!\r\n\r\nYou're right, good catch. I always forget about #3408. The time it took to build up the object was pretty negligible compared to the total query duration, though.\r\n\r\nYour suggestion can be further simplified which also makes it a bit faster:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table('right')('id').map([ r.row, true ]).coerceTo('array').coerceTo('object')\r\n\r\n// original:             500ms\r\n// coerceTo:             55ms\r\n// coerceTo simplified:  38ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found it slightly odd that `sequence.coerceTo('object')` fails. It seems like that should implicitly coerce to array first."
