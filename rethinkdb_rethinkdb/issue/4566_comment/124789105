      "Sorry to bump this again, but one more quick question. I don't know enough about how indices are persisted or the data structures used to speak about this intelligently (is it documented somewhere?), but would it be possible to optimize the case of getting primary/secondary index values from a table? For example, is `table('id')` any more efficient than `table('any_other_field')` or do both require scanning every document? Likewise, it seems like `table.distinct({ index: 'secondary' })` ends up doing a lot of reads and I'd be interested to better understand why that's necessary."
