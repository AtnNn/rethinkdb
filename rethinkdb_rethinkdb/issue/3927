        "Hi All,\r\n\r\nSo it looks like some queries in the WebUI are returning their execution time twice. I click 'run' once, and below the WebUI says 'Executed in xx', but no actual results are returned. About a second later the Executed time changes and results are returned.\r\n\r\nSeeing is believing:\r\n\r\n![executed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/44855/6608537/ff5ec772-c804-11e4-9efa-b0265f77dcdb.gif)\r\n\r\nThis is most prevalent in queries that involve subqueries, but I'm not sure exactly what about the query is causing it. Can reproduce 100% of the time with this query:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.db('fw').table('issuedbundlelicenses').filter(function(license) {\r\n  return r.db('fw').table('recurringsubscription').filter({CustomerID: license('CustomerId')}).nth(0).default(null).eq(null);\r\n}).filter({ProductId: 369});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is on latest rethinkdb 1.16.2-1. Obviously not too big of a deal but figured I'd throw it your way! :star2: "
