      "I wouldn't do this unless we have a very strong reason for doing it. It has effects on the cost of meta operations and significantly reduces the efficiency of reads (especially secondary index reads, but also range reads).\r\n\r\n(also compare https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1043 where we increased the number from 4 to 8, although some of the metadata scalability issues have since been addressed).\r\n\r\nAlso note that we already use additional cores for query parsing, the serializer, and i/o. We also use more than 8 cores for btree operations if multiple tables are being used."
