      "> I'm wondering if anyone knows why they were split in the first place.\r\n\r\nPresumably because that gives better visibility into what's going on for people who want it, but our visibility is already terrible because stats are inaccessible due to poor structure and documentation (and also, too many stats cause too much noise and obscurity). I think it makes sense to merge them, and then split again if and when someone actually needs that feature (at that point we'd presumably have a much more accessible stat system)."
