      "To be honest, I'm not sure why we're tracking sindex btree stats separately.  It increases the amount of work we have to do during stats requests (and increases the size of the stats requests, which was already a problem).  I'd prefer to just have them use the same perfmons, but I'm wondering if anyone knows why they were split in the first place."
