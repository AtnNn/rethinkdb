      "Thanks for reporting this. I believe we may have discussed this issue before. Generating the C++ headers on install will require both a supported version of libprotobuf and protoc installed on your system. I've tested it with 2.4.1 and 2.5.0 bit other versions might also work. We might even include the .proto and pregenerated C++ headers for when protoc is not installed but libprotobuf is compatible. @atnnn how hard would it be to check for the versions of these packages on install?"
