      "Yes, I think this issue is a dup of an existing one, but I can't for the life of me find it (@atnnn will know). @robert-zaremba -- we are definitely going to do this. It's a slightly non-trivial amount of work to package everything correctly though, and there are temporarily some higher priority issues that we're working through. We should be able to get this done pretty soon.\r\n\r\nDo you have a good work around in the meantime?"
