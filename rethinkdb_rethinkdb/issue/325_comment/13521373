      "I think `flatten` should be polymorphic on sequences and objects. On sequences\r\n\r\n```\r\nseq.flatten() = seq.map(r.row.flatten())\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn objects:\r\n\r\n```\r\nobj.flatten(...) = obj.map_merge(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs to what specific arguments `flatten` accepts and what it does with them, I think you're roughly correct, but we still have to work out what to do with pluck. But basically, the whole thing is sugar for `merge`."
