      "Just to make sure I understand, flatten is sugar for:\r\n\r\n    seq.flatten() = seq.reduce(lambda x,y: map_merge(x[\"value\"], y[\"value\"]))\r\n\r\nI think this is a very intuitive meaning for flatten. And flatten can also take arguments which is equivalent to:\r\n\r\n    seq.flatten(foo, bar) = seq.pluck(foo, bar).flatten()\r\n\r\n"
