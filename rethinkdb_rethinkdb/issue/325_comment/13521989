      "So polymorphism here seems very inconsistent with how we do `pick` and `pluck.` `Pick` and `pluck` are the same operation but one is for an object while the other is for a sequence of objects. I feel fairly strongly that we should either have both of these be polymorphic or neither.\r\n\r\nI'm in favor of making them polymorphic and I remember we argued about this at one point and judging by our current solution the other side won. Does anyone remember what the arguments were, @coffeemug I feel like you were the main opponent of polymorphism for pluck and pick but I could be misremembering."
