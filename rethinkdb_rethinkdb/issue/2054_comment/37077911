      "I'm personally don't really like the warning. It's intrusive in the sense that nothing bad can happen -- it's not like if the user can declare a machine dead.\r\nFor me it would be like if we were adding a warning every time the user was using reduce that would tell the user that this is not a fold.\r\n\r\nSo users have to be able to hide it.\r\n\r\nI'll fix the style for now, but if we decide not to display it, I would be happy to delete my branch :-)"
