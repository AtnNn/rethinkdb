      "I wouldn't refer to `GROUPED_DATA` since people don't necessarily know what it is.\r\n\r\nHere is one possibility:\r\n\r\n> Any command chained after `group` will be applied to each reduction. Add a call to `ungroup` to convert the result to an array.\r\n\r\nIt would also be great to have a cookbook entry for this and add a link to it in the message."
