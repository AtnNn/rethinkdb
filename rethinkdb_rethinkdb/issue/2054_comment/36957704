      "I put a blue info box for the warning (it looks better than an alert) in case the user gets back a `GROUPED_DATA`.\r\n\r\nThe question now is what do we put in the warning.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understood (correct me if I'm wrong), the point of the warning is to let people know that the type returned is not a DATUM even though we display it as a DATUM.\r\nThe main consequence being that any method chained after the query will be applied to each reduction, unless `ungroup` is called.\r\n\r\nShould we phrase it as\r\n\"The returned result is a GROUPED_DATA. Any method chained after the current query will be applied on each reduction.\"\r\n\r\nPing @coffeemug, @mlucy -- any though on what the message should be?"
