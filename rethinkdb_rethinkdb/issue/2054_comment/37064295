      "We can make the message tighter and have it not spill to multiple lines. Here is shorter, tighter text:\r\n\r\n> Commands chained after `group` will apply to each reduction. Call `ungroup` to execute commands on all the groups.\r\n\r\nAlso, a few more notes:\r\n\r\n* The original message interchanged the words \"method\" and \"command\". When we refer to ReQL commands we should always call them \"commands\" (in the docs, UI, etc.)\r\n* The little `x` to close the infobox seems too far left. It should be closer to the border.\r\n* The style of `x` when you mouse over it is odd. In the yellow box (say, when you delete a table and get a message that a table has been deleted), mousing over `x` results in it being bolder (which I like). Mousing over the `x` in the blue infobox here results in it being underlined. Also, the font styles for each `x` appear different. We should use a consistent style for both types of infoboxes.\r\n\r\nOther than these comments, everything is awesome.\r\n\r\nAlso a question -- will this show up in the autocomplete docs after tabs/dots? (I don't think it's worth taking the time to do it, btw; I think this implementation is great)"
