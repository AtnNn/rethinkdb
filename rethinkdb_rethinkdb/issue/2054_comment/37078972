      "The update warning is different because if you hide it by clicking `x`, it will show up again on the next update. Clicking `x` doesn't turn it off permanently.\r\n\r\nI see what you mean, though, with your `fold` analogy. May be a better alternative is to put it in gray text under the edit box? Or give it an entirely different style so it seems less obtrusive?\r\n\r\nLet's talk to @mglukhovsky on Monday, I bet we'll come up with something that makes everyone reasonably happy."
