      "Some more feedback.\r\n\r\n@mlucy proposed the following message, which I like more (it seems both more precise *and* easier to understand):\r\n\r\n> Commands chained after `group` will operate on each reduction. Call `ungroup` to operate on the array of groups.\r\n\r\nAlso, after some thought, I don't like the fact that clicking the `x` will hide the message forever. It's far to easy to a) click it without reading the message, and b) read the message, click on the x, and then run a group query later completely forgetting about the message.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the solution is. We could remove the `x` entirely (which I'd be ok with), or add a setting \"remind me about groupings\" or something. I think for now we should just force people to put up with this message and see what users think about it.\r\n\r\n@neumino -- thoughts?"
