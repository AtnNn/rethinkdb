      "Two more thoughts:\r\n\r\n* We should strive to make the presentation of the message strike the fleeting balance between being noticeable and unobtrusive. If we screw up the former, people will run into this problem and will get frustrated. If we screw up the latter, people will quickly get annoyed that we're telling them something they already know.\r\n* I think a link to the cookbook/troubleshooting entry on this in the message is pretty important. The message is great, but there is no way to fully remove all confusion unless you already know what's going on."
