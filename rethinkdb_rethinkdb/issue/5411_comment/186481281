      "Fixed in v2.2.x ca002ee and next 67fb015.\r\n\r\nThe optimization I ended up with only improves performance when points are stored in the index (rather than polygons or lines), but that's the most common case.\r\n\r\nThere's another optimization that can be done in the future which will have less of an impact, but works for all stored geometries (though it will now do very little for points, since the optimizations intersect)."
