      "RethinkDB actually uses ./rethinkdb_data i.e. it creates a folder called rethinkdb_data in the directory it's run from. I'm a big fan of this solution since it makes it very obvious to users where exactly the data is going without having to resort to googling or stracing the process. It also makes it very obvious how to run multiple instances at once on the same machine, you can just put them in separate directories. I've actually had several people praise the fact that we just put the data in a directory where the process is run so I'd be pretty averse to changing this now, especially since it's a convention that people know at this point. \r\n\r\n@ZDroid if you want your data to go in to the directory `~/.rethinkdb` you can always pass the flag `-d ~/.rethinkdb` to RethinkDB as you start it up."
