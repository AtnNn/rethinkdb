        "## Intro\n\nhttps://github.com/apa512/clj-rethinkdb/issues/69 was opened with some interesting behaviour when using `get-all`. After tracing this, it seems that RethinkDB is returning different results for the same query. I'm unsure whether this is a race condition, or a standard condition that drivers should expect and handle transparently.\n## Problem\n\nRunning `(r/get-all table [\"id\" \"cake\"] {:index \"by-race-id\"})` returns the same result (\"r\") but with either  `SUCCESS_SEQUENCE` (2) type or `SUCCESS_PARTIAL` (3) as the type (\"t\").\n\nTwo example lines from log output:\n\n```\nWriting: [4 [1,[78,[[15,[[14,[\"clj_rethinkdb_test\"]],\"example\"]],\"id\",\"cake\"],{\"index\":\"by-race-id\"}]]]\nReading: [4 {\"t\":3,\"r\":[{\"id\":\"6ec8d72a-9d35-405d-92a8-fe10af537016\",\"race-id\":\"id\",\"test\":\"document\"}],\"n\":[]}]\n              ^^^^\n\nWriting: [5 [1,[78,[[15,[[14,[\"clj_rethinkdb_test\"]],\"example\"]],\"id\",\"cake\"],{\"index\":\"by-race-id\"}]]]\nReading: [5 {\"t\":2,\"r\":[{\"id\":\"6ec8d72a-9d35-405d-92a8-fe10af537016\",\"race-id\":\"id\",\"test\":\"document\"}],\"n\":[]}]\n              ^^^^\n```\n## Questions\n- Is it expected that the same query can return either SUCCESS_SEQUENCE or SUCCESS_PARTIAL? If so then we'll handle this better in the driver.\n- Alternatively, is this a race condition?\n## Reproduction\n\nA reproduction repo is available at https://github.com/danielcompton/clj-rethinkdb-test. You can run it by running `lein run` (after installing [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org))\n"
