        "This is a follow-up of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3298 .\r\n\r\n> We will be providing an `on(cb)` function on cursors, and integrate with the framework's event loop to call the callback once we get a response.\r\n\r\nThis issue is for a Twisted-based implementation. Unless Twisted provides another natural way of handling errors, we should probably just make the cb a function on `(error, row)` like in the JS driver.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn open question is how to package the Twisted driver variant. The easiest way probably is to have a separate module \r\n```py\r\nimport rethinkdb-twisted as r\r\n```\r\nthat is equivalent to `rethinkdb` except for using Twisted for i/o.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to have a special connection type, e.g. `r.connect(host, backend=\"twisted\")`. That's a bit nicer to use I think, but I don't know how much work it is to get the driver module import properly on a system that doesn't even have Twisted installed.\r\n\r\nPinging @gchpaco @timmaxw @larkost for comments."
