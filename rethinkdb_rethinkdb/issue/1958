        "I wanted to use Valgrind, so I compiled with\r\n`make DEBUG=1 VALGRIND=1`.\r\nMake told me:\r\n`src/build.mk:244: *** cannot build with VALGRIND=1 when NO_TCMALLOC=0.  Stop.`\r\n\r\nOk, so I built with `make DEBUG=1 VALGRIND=1 NO_TCMALLOC=1`. That worked at first.\r\n\r\nHowever the generated binary was still using tcmalloc, and make also warned about NO_TCMALLOC potentially being an unknown variable.\r\n\r\nWhat was actually necessary was to rerun configure `./configure --without-tcmalloc`. The NO_TCMALLOC flag probably doesn't have any impact anymore, does it?\r\n\r\nVALGRIND=1 should not check for NO_TCMALLOC being 1, but for whatever the `--without-tcmalloc` configure option sets."
