      "I feel like with ReQL's native terms becoming more powerful and considering the fact that `r.js` is relatively slow and should be considered more of a backup than a feature that we encourage anyone to use, adding `r.coffee` appears rather useless.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug: Would you say your initial motivation for this still holds? Otherwise, can we just close this?"
