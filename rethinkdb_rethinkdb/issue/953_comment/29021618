      "My initial motivation was publicity -- \"RethinkDB now supports coffeescript\" would generate attention. That alone isn't a great motivation to add a feature, but I did think that adding a way to write server-side js code in coffeescript would be neat (which is also a pretty poor reason to add a feature).\r\n\r\nSo, since all I have is a combination of pretty poor reasons to add a feature, I'm cool with closing this :)"
