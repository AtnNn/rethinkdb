        "Right now python cursors `__misrepr__` themselves in a few weird ways. First they change their `__repr__` based on what data has been read. From the socket. This means that their `__repr__` will change as you iterate them which can be confusing. This also can happen with the end flag leading to the trailing `...` suddenly being dropped when it realizes that it's hit the end of the line.\n\nNotice: I'm guessing a bit at the behavior here because testing is blocked by #417.\n\nSolution:\nI think we shouldn't display the values in the `__repr__` at all because that means storing them in memory and we don't want to do that. Why not just have something like:\n\n``` Python\n<Cursor: r.table(foo)>\n```\n"
