      "I think that if we do this, we should just use `do`. If people use the streams incorrectly, they'll get an informative error message about the limitations, and will know what went wrong and how to use the feature. If eventually we remove the limitation, we'll just let people know and they'll be able to essentially use the same API.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still think this will require a porcelain syntax like https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1725#issuecomment-29547903 to make it easier for users to understand/type/etc. I think it's worthwhile to try to figure out what that syntax is first. It might give us bigger bang for the buck to just implement the porcelain syntax directly and drop the more general purpose implementation."
