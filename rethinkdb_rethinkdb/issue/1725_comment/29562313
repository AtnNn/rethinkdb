      "@mlucy it seems like you're still going to have to do some fairly heavy duty analysis to make sure that your arguments to `split` don't reference themselves. And I think that if we're going to do that it's not a huge step farther to just let people bind streams to variables and statically check that they're not evaluating things recursively. It also gets a lot better. For example with this `avg` becomes almost unnecessary. You can simply write:\r\n\r\n```Ruby\r\ntable[\"pts\"].do({|s| s.sum() / s.count()})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not advocating we get rid of `avg` but having it be this flexible seems really powerful. I actually talked to @atnnn about a scheme like this he had come up with and I believe actually wrote some code for in the haskell driver. I think we should definitely take a look at how nice we can get this."
