      "@danielmewes correct example could be made only in case of the several filters. \r\n\r\nLets say we have \"categories\" with ID numbers and \"prices\" with ranges (0-10, 10-20). When I'm selecting \"0-10\" in prices and 1 in categories, other \"prices\" and \"categories\" should also have count numbers, which tells how many \"items\" will filtered-in after I select those categories or price ranges. The problem here is when I'm selecting category 1, the other \"categories\" should be also grouped. But `group` aggregates values only after `filter` makes it work, so the `group` could not return count of category \"2\" when category \"2\" was selected in a `filter`. \r\n\r\nSimply: \"categories\" `group` should somehow skip `filter` by \"categories\", but \"prices\" `group` should include filtering by the \"categories\".\r\n\r\nGoal of the disjunctive faceted search is to show only possible variants of filters, and by including more selections in one filter (categories or prices) it extends search."
