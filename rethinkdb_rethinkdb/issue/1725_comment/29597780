      "@jdoliner -- that example with `avg` would work with the `split` semantics I'm proposing as well.\r\n\r\nThe analysis is actually pretty straightforward; the variable `x` bound by split:\r\n* Can only have terminals called on it (we already have a list of these for when we push work to the shards).\r\n* Can't be referenced from inside a nested function.\r\n\r\nIf we enforce those two constraints, we can do something efficient without too much work.\r\n\r\nI think that supporting full-blown streams in variables in a way that we know will be efficient would be a lot more work, but I'm not necessarily opposed to it if there's an easy way to do it."
