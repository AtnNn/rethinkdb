      "It sounds to me like we're pretty close to agreeing on the functionality here. @mlucy what you're describing sounds close enough to me to binding the stream to a variable that I think it's going to be easier to explain to users as `do` than `split`. I think concept of \"if I want to use the same value multiple times without recomputing it I bind it to a variable\" is universal enough that this is the easiest way to explain the functionality. And when people do hit the limitations of binding streams I don't think it's going to be harder to understand than it would be if it was a differently named function. Also we will eventually be overcoming a lot of those limitations so long term it's going to be very similar to `do`.\r\n\r\nAlso if we don't just roll the functionality in to `do` I really hate the name `split`. We're not splitting the stream what we're doing is better described as `tee` or maybe `clone`."
