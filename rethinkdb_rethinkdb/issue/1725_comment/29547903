      "> I was thinking of split having semantics where the only legal operations on the value in the variable are reductions (sum etc. count as reductions for this).\r\n\r\nI think it would be much more intuitive to implement a command that combines reductions instead:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nr.table('users').group('city').combine(r.count, r.avg('age'), r.max('height'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n(The syntax above ~~is~~ might be weird, but a step in the right direction IMO; also, sorry for commenting on this out of discussion period).\r\n\r\n"
