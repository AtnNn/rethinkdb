      "@danielmewes -- I'd like to propose taking this out of the reql discussion for 2.1/polish. There are already a lot of issues to discuss, and I think this one is unlikely to get a good discussion that it deserves. How do you feel about getting back to it after 2.1 is out (or possibly after 2.2)?"
