      "More specifically, as `git-bisect` indicates, why did that behavior work before 24ba709536ded05d4002c8ea920fd208be1ebda3, but break after?\r\n\r\nThe best I've got is that the `std::move` left the map in an undefined state which interacted poorly with the `counted_t<const shared_buf_t>` in the `shared_buf_ref_t` in `datum_string_t`."
