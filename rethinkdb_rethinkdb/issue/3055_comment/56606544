      "@coffeemug, I would rather push this into 1.15.x because it would involve a minor refactor of how these exceptions are constructed and passed around, and it is a cosmetic change.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure here as I'm still rather new to this code, but I suspect that the issue @AtnNn pointed out is a problem with the transformations provided by `build_polygon_with_inradius_at_least` or `build_polygon_with_exradius_at_most` when performing a nearest traversal, and should probably be a separate issue."
