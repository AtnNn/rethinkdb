      "Just a quick note: Our internal implementation of geometry is sort of unit-less, but in practice our convention is that they use meters (since we happen to define the WGS84 ellipsoid in meters). So the quickest fix would be to add m as the unit to the error message.\r\n\r\nUsing the unit that the user supplied in the error message is a bit more work, because currently units only exist in the topmost ReQL term layer and not underneath where this exception is generated. One option could be to extend the `geo_exception_t` class to have a `to_unit()` method that can be called to regenerate the error message with the given unit."
