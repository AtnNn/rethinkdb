      "> So if I write `r.connect(profile=True)` then every time I run a query the profile gets appended to an array inside the connection?\r\n\r\nI was thinking that setting `profile=True` on the connection would just be equivalent to setting `profile=True` on every instance of `run` (unless the user explicitly specifies `profile=False` in `run`). This is effectively a driver-only convenience change.\r\n\r\nI agree that appending profiles on the server until the user chooses to fetch them is a bad idea."
