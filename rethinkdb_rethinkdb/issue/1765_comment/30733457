      "@coffeemug yeah that would be nice but sometimes its nice to just turn it on for a select route and so on or when i am logged in as one user if a customer tells u something funky goes on when they load a cirten page deploy a hot fix that profiles everything they do.\r\n\r\nI know i have put a lot of werid feature requests in and i know that your really focusing on perfomance and stablity stuff right now just dont want you guys to get into the MySQL death trap where you gotten so much perfomance that now you cant add feautres because it will make perfomance worse. While psotgresql added all the features under the sun they have a nice soild base and then spent time getting the perfomance up. Based on the tickets I have submited you will find they are the building blocks that will help with making new features out of them OR that they are the tools that devs need to fix perofmance issues or allow there app to work better with rethinkdb\r\n"
