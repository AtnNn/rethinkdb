      "So if I write `r.connect(profile=True)` then every time I run a query the profile gets appended to an array inside the connection? It seems like that would make it kind of easy to accidentally consume a lot of memory in your python process. It's also so easy to write this code yourself by just wrapping the connection and then we know the person doing it is aware of the memory implications.\r\n\r\nA major feature that's planned for the profiling tools is the ability to aggregate the profiles of queries on the server. Eventually you'll be able to see exactly what gets run over the lifetime of a connection in an interactive view but this is probably a ways off."
