      "@coffeemug ruthless is fine and needed at this time just dont want anyone to get upset with the number of tickets i submit about different features everyone should be happy about the work thus far. Also did you get the email i sent over the weekend offering to help with the documentation and give en-depth documentation usage guides and so on to really help users get a more en-depth understanding? Not that they cant go into the IRC but being able to google search and get a result is the best\r\n"
