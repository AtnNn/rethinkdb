        "The series of tests created by `test/full_test/error_tolerant.test` all cause cluster changes while other operations are happening to them. If a sever crashes or one of the asserts along the way triggers, then the test is failed. However there is nothing in most of the tests that verifies that the cluster is still capable of producing correct results. This is a missed opportunity that I should remedy, probably with a `--workload-after`.\n"
