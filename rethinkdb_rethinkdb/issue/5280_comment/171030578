      "@danielmewes -- We *should* be yielding even for truncated keys because all that logic does is prevent the normal iteration logic from aborting when it normally would, but it's certainly possible there's a bug related to that.  It's also possible that there's somewhere else where we don't yield when processing the batch, and if the batch is sufficiently large (which you'd get in this case with truncated keys) then we take a long time to yield."
