      "Thanks for the report @r-marques .\r\n\r\n@mlucy Do you think this could be caused by key truncation? Maybe we don't yield if there are a lot of documents with the same truncated key?\r\n\r\n@r-marques Would it be an option to make the `assignee` shorter? For example you could use `r.uuid` (http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/uuid) to hash the assignee string. I think this might give you better performance, though I'm not sure if this will resolve the issue or not."
