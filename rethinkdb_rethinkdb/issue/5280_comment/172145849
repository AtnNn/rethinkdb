      "@r-marques Sorry about the confusion regarding `orderBy.changes`. I think we should actually disallow this query, since it doesn't currently do what it looks like. I opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5293 to discuss that change.\r\n\r\nWe still need to figure out the reason for the initial performance issue.\r\nPlease let us know when you get a chance to try the uuid keys."
