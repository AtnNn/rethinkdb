      "@r-marques -- are there examples that look like `r.table('test').orderBy(index: ...).changes()` in the docs?  There should be examples that look like `r.table('test').orderBy(index: ...).limit(n).changes()`, where you need the ordering to define the extrema that you want to subscribe to changes on, but if there are examples with `orderBy` but no `limit` we should probably remove them to avoid confusion."
