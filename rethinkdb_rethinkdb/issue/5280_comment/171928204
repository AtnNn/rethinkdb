      "@mlucy The examples do have `limit` in them. I realized that in the documentation it says \"order_by requires limit; neither command works by itself.\" I am not using limit and it works.\r\n\r\nSo from what I understand is that using `order_by` without `limit` in a changefeed does not guarantee correct ordering, right?\r\n\r\nAnd if I do use limit how can I get all the documents with `include_initial=True`?"
