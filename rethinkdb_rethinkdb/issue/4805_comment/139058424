      "That makes sense. I'm not sure if there is a reason for not doing it.\r\nThe only one I can think of is if we want to update the JS driver without releasing a new server version. In that case both versions could still get out of sync (unless there's a way in Semver versions to have a fourth version number?).\r\nThis is less of a problem in the other drivers, since we use an additional fourth number for driver releases there anyway. That is in addition to the three version numbers that we use to version our server releases.\r\n\r\n@AtnNn any thoughts on this?"
