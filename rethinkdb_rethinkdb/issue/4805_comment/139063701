      "We've been keeping only the first two numbers in sync because that's when the driver version syncs up with the server version. Point releases to the driver and to RethinkDB are often done separately.\r\n\r\nI believe the current situation is that the latest `x.y.*` driver should work with all `x.y.*` versions of RethinkDB.\r\n\r\nI think that ideally the development of the driver and the server would be decoupled and split into separate repositories. Their versions would diverge from each other even more. That would require investing a lot more love and magic into the driver.\r\n\r\nMaking the drivers submodules would be, in my opinion, a step in the right direction. But it would require convincing anyone who's used git submodules before that they're worth the trouble."
