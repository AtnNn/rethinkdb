      "A fix for this is in code review 1814.\r\n\r\nThe way the fix works is that you now have to get a subscription on a change_tracking_map_t to retrieve the set of changed keys. The subscription checks that you haven't skipped any version. If a version was skipped, the code falls back to recomputing everything."
