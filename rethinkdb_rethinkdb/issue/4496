        "In the 2.0.x branch the `connections/cursor.js` is hanging. A bit of selective commenting out shows that this is in the `works with a large array` subtest, specifically that it is never timing out. This is not happening either in a similar subtest for tables, nor is it happening in `next`. Since this is on a much better test ported from (pre-2.1) `next` it is possible that this is not a regression, but is a problem we have had for some time.\r\n\r\nI have played around a bit, and it seems that the per-iteration function is working as expected, and it is only that the final function (with the corresponding `done()` is just never called."
