      "Alright, here's what I think we should do:\r\n* Make `null` not be in the secondary index because it's confusing.\r\n* Leave the current `null` syntax for 1.7.  It's ugly, but if we don't allow NULLs in secondary indexes then it's non-ambiguous, and I think there are more important RQL problems that we need to address first.  (We still have dual-inclusive `slice`, for god's sake.)\r\n* Open a new issue to fix `between`, since it's outside the scope of this issue (we originally got onto it because I misunderstood what Slava was saying).\r\n\r\nAs for what I think we should do about `between`, I actually sort of like `r.minval` and `r.maxval`.  They would be useful in other terms as well.  For example, they would fix #955 at the same time; you could get a common prefix by writing `table.between([prefix, r.minval], [prefix, r.maxval], :index => ...)`."
