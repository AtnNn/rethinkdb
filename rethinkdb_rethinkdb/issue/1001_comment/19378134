      "This is more of a `between` thing than a secondary index thing.  If we change this we'll have to pick a new way to denote an empty endpoint for `between`.\r\n\r\nAlso, as an aside, making a secondary index with `match` like that won't really do what you want because each row that matches will have its own entry in the index (rather than being `true` it will be some object).  So even with this change, you could easily get all the rows that don't match a regex, but you couldn't get all the rows that do.\r\n\r\nWhat you really want here is `r.row('first_name').match('S.*').coerce_to(\"bool\")`, although that's an ugly thing to ask people to type."
