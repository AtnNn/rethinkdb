      "Using null as a special value in between is just generally a bad idea, we\r\nshould stop doing it and use a special value to represent unboundedness. My\r\nobjection is that if you're getting the arguments to between from another\r\nexpression such as accessing a field of another document its very easy for\r\na null which meant nonexistence to become a null which means unboundedness\r\nand yield confusing results.\r\nOn Jun 13, 2013 4:58 PM, \"Michael Lucy\" <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> @wmrowan <https://github.com/wmrowan> -- that works fine.\r\n> coerce_to(\"bool\") is effectively equivalent to do{|x| x.ne(null).and(x.ne\r\n> (false)).\r\n>\r\n> @coffeemug <https://github.com/coffeemug> -- we currently disallow nullas the value for an index and use it as a special value in\r\n> between.
