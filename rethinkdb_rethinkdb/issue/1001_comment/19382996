      "I thought we had a rule that index (only primary?) keys could not be null. This is what allows us to use null for empty endpoint in between. If secondary index keys can be null but between is supposed to work on secondary indexes then we already can't use nulls to denote empty endpoints. This is an inconsistency that we have to fix one way or the other.\r\n\r\nGiven that we decided to go the route that null generally means nonexistence then @coffeemug's original proposal makes total sense. Returning null in the secondary index function means \"don't include in the index\".\r\n\r\n@mlucy why does the query have to be `(...).coerce_to('boo')`? Why does @coffeemug's `(...).ne(null)` not work?"
