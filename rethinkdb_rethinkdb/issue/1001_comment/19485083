      "One moment ya'll -- I was just talking about changing the behavior of `indexCreate` to drop rows where the key of the secondary index is `null` (where as right now the row inserted with a `null` key).\r\n\r\nThe issue of `between` is somewhat related, but regardless of what we do with `between` I think we should change the behavior of index creation."
