      "Mostly because it would be yet another case where `null` and non-existence differ.  If someone creates a secondary index on a particular field (which I think is by far the most common use case, especially for novice users), then it's confusing to have different behavior when that field doesn't exist vs. when it's `null`.  I could be convinced otherwise, though.\r\n\r\nActually, it turns out that we already exclude `null` from secondary indices; `between` is just incorrect because it has a code path from before we had secondary indexes where if you don't specify either endpoint it's just an identity op.  We should just fix between to not have that behavior."
