      "@jdoliner -- I really don't like our new trend toward introducing terms that are only valid inside of one specific other term.  It feels really hacky and ugly (although `null` does too).  Can you think of any way of getting rid of `null` that doesn't do that?\r\n\r\n@neumino -- the advantage of Slava's proposal would be that creating an index on an attribute would have exactly the same behavior if that attribute is `null` or if that attribute doesn't exist in the object.  I also think that if we could push people away from using `null` as a regular value rather than a way to represent non-existence, that that might be a good thing."
