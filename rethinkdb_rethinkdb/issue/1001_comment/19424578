      "@wmrowan -- that works fine.  `coerce_to(\"bool\")` is effectively equivalent to `do{|x| x.ne(null).and(x.ne(false))`.\r\n\r\n@coffeemug -- we currently disallow `null` as the value for an index and use it as a special value in `between`.  If you write `.between(null, 1)` that means \"anything <= 1\", not \"anything between null and 1\"."
