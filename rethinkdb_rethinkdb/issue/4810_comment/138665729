      "I think this would be really useful.\r\n\r\nMarking as `ReQL_proposal` and putting into `subsequent`.\r\n\r\nMySQL has a comparable feature that can be useful for non-transactional storage engines: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_get-lock\r\n\r\nI think we might want to bind locks to actual tables, since then we can use the replication settings of those tables. This makes sure that whenever enough servers are up to allow writes to a particular table, you will also be able to (eventually) acquire the mutex, and vice versa."
