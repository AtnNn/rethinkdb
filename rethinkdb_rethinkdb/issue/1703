        "Lost power a few hours after creating a small test table with maybe 5 rows in it. When i restarted the server the table was empty. I MAY have lost 100k records from a different table. Not sure how often fsync is called with --no-direct-io and if it just waits for linux to force call fsync that could be the issue. I will update the ticket when i get back to my workstation with the mount output but should just be default ext4 with normal linuxmint (ubuntu) defaults"
