        "Hi,\n\nI have just gone from 1.12 to current (1.14.1 I think).\n\nIn 1.12 I had a table with ~2.1 Million documents.\nSince 1.14.1 it's now gone to ~ 2.0 Million documents.\n\nWhile I understand that manual migration is not an issue anymore, I think we should still consider disaster recovery situations. Note:\n\nnew/rethinkdb-data$ du -hs\n1.5G    .\nold/rethinkdb-datadu -hs\n6.8G    .\n\nIs this relevant (#2598)?\n\nI'm going to repopulate the database with the raw input and check how many documents reported.\n\nCheers\nMitch\n"
