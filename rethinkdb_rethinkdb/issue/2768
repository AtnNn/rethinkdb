        "Just like you can use `.merge()` on sequences and single selection, it would be nice to be able to do the same with `.map()`.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nr.table('Post').merge(function(post) { return {foo: true}; })\r\nr.table('Post').get(0).merge(function(post) { return {foo: true}; })\r\n\r\nr.table('Post').map(function(post) { return r.branch(post('deleted'), {deleted: true}, post); })\r\nr.table('Post').get(0).map(function(post) { return r.branch(post('deleted'), {deleted: true}, post); })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe use case is that sometimes I have to work on an opaque query that could either be a sequence or a single selection, and while some functions work fine on both (`.merge()`, `.pluck()`), more advanced cases don't."
