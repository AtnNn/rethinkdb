      "Thanks @jrote1, that's very helpful information.\r\nThis sounds like we're using a 32 bit offset somewhere in the Windows port and it overflows when the file grows over ~4 GB, thereby either truncating the file or overwriting the beginning of it.\r\n\r\nI think we can investigate this without the data for now, though we might need it later."
