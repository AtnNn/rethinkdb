      "Thanks for the report @jrote1 and sorry you had to run into this. I'm surprised that an out-of-memory condition would corrupt the data file, so we should investigate this.\r\n\r\nCan you send us a copy of the data directory (`rethinkdb_data` or a folder in `/var/lib/rethinkdb` by default)? If yes, I can give you access to our upload server so you can upload the data securely and without size limitations. We can also sign an NDA if the data is confidential.\r\n\r\nThe data would help is to investigate the type of the corruption, and potentially allow us to recover the data as well though I cannot promise that this is going to be possible.\r\n\r\nWhat system are you running RethinkDB on? Operating system, hardware, disks, any virtualization?"
