      "@jrote1 Normally we use 64 bit integers for all file offsets, so the limit would be 8,192 PiB (pebibyte). \r\n\r\nThe limiting factor will usually be the amount of available RAM, since you typically need about 1% of the total data size in RAM for some internal index structures with RethinkDB."
