There is confidential information so we would want to get an NDA signed before uploading the data.\r\n\r\nWith our use case we are seeing sustained writes of about 350 a second and this failure is quite consistent as it is the third time this has happened. And all three times the data file was 4,325,376 kb in size\r\n\r\nWe are running on:\r\nWindows Server 2016\r\n6GB RAM\r\n4 Core 3.2GHz\r\nRunning VMWare ESXi"
