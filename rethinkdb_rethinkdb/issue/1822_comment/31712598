      "I'd also note that I don't believe your setup.py for the Python driver works with Python 3. You use `print \"hey\"` instead of `print(\"hey\")`.\r\n\r\nFurther, once I've fixed the setup.py, I can't import the module. It fails on `AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute '__func__'`"
