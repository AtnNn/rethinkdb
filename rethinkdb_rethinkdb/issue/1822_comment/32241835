      "While working on this issue I found many other incompatibilities between the rethinkdb python driver and python 3.\r\n\r\n@hammer, you are the only person to report that our driver does not work with python 3 anymore. This leads me to believe that no one else has tried using rethinkdb with Python 3. Also, the python 3 support for protobuf is experimental.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone object to leaving the python driver as-is (python 2 only) and removing the python 3 instructions from the website?"
