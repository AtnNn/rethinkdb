      "The error suggests that the changes to the documentation are incompatible with python 3. We do not test python 3 support for the python driver.\r\n\r\nIf the problem is indeed related to the documentation, it can be avoided by removing the `import rethinkdb.docs` line from `rethinkdb/__init__.py`.\r\n\r\nWe should fix the generated documentation and start testing the python driver with python 3.\r\n\r\n"
