      "@hammer, thanks for opening this issue. I've opened rethinkdb/docs#169 to track the documentation issue.\r\n\r\nAs far as using setup.py and importing the module with Python 3, I'd ask @Tryneus or @atnnn to look into this. Do we have unit tests running for Python 3 support (since it requires a custom build)?"
