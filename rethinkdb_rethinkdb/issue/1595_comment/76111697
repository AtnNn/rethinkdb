      "It seems that every version starting with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion always uses a 64 bit kernel, at least according to http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4287 \"Can I switch between the 64-bit kernel and 32-bit kernel?\"\r\n\r\nThere probably aren't many people out there who still run 10.7, so I think we should just close this unless @larkost knows a better flag to test the architecture out of his head."
