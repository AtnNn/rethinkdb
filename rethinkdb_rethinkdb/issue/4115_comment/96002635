      "@jezzball -- ah, sorry, I was wrong about the bug (though my explanation was still correct).\r\n\r\nWrt to formatting, I can't seem to reproduce. I inserted 20,000 documents into the database. When I can `orderBy` without an index I get no formatting (as expected), but when I add `.limit(10)` the results are formatted.\r\n\r\nCould you give me a better idea of how to reproduce?\r\n\r\nAlso, I opened #4116 to address some other polish issues I noticed, FYI."
