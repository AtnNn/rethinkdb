      "I agree with @AtnNn that we should call the function right away rather than recursing.  I'm not sure what we should do with `r.literal`; I think ignoring it except that returning `r.literal` deletes a key is a good choice.  (We could also leave that out of the initial implementation if it turns out to be hard, I would guess it's pretty rare to want to do that.)"
