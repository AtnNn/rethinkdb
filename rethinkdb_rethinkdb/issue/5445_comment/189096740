      "I just had a quick peek at the related code and hopefully just spotted the problem, compare https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/net.py#L277 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/tornado_net/net_tornado.py#L87.\r\n\r\nNote that in the synchronous driver we use `socket.create_connection(...)` whilst in the Tornado driver we use `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, ...)` which obviously means we don't support IPv6 there.\r\n\r\nWe likely have the same problem in the asyncio and gevent drivers, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/asyncio_net/net_asyncio.py#L135 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/python/rethinkdb/gevent_net/net_gevent.py#L65 respectively.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus -- the fix should be straightforward, could you please have a look since you have the setup required to test this?"
