      "I found the cause.\r\n\r\nMy remote server's hostname is registered in `/etc/hosts` by IPv6 address.\r\nIf I try IPv4 address, the connection succeeds.\r\nSo the problem is that Python driver's async connection is **not** IPv6 capable.\r\nI didn't try twisted but at least tornado backend is **not** capable.\r\n\r\nPython's sync connection and JS driver are IPv6 capable.\r\n"
