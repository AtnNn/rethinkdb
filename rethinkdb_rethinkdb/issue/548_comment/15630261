      "I think one thing that would help to clear up the confusion here would be showing what the errant object was.\r\n\r\n@mlucy you mentioned you think getting rid of bases might help keep people from getting confused. I'm not 100% sure if that's the best option because bases are really useful when you need them. Maybe we should toy with the names a bit here. We could actually add a true fold function pretty and maybe there's a name for reduce that would describe it better."
