      "I think @al3xandru's point was that in the following example it's possible to detect and report a mistake at runtime:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nr.table('test').reduce(0) {|acc, row| acc + row[:num]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore passing a row to the block you first compare its type to the type of the base, and error if they differ. However, I agree that this heuristic is very error prone and I'd rather drop the base. @jdoliner -- what's an example where base is really useful (other than in case of empty streams, which I think we can deal with)?"
