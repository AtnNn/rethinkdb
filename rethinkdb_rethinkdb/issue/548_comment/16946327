      "I'd like to sum up this issue so we can start moving forward again.\r\n\r\nWe all seem to agree on the following changes:\r\n\r\n* Change the argument names from `acc` and `val` to `left` and `right`\r\n* remove the `base` optional argument\r\n* expand and improve the documentation for `reduce`\r\n\r\nNo consensus has yet been reached on the idea of adding a `fold` command.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to write a blog post fully explaining the design choices surrounding `reduce`, similar to the post on lambda functions I'm working on. It'll be fun to write and can later serve as in depth documentation."
