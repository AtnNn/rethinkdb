      "Ah, I see, thank-you @al3xandru and @wmrowan for the explanations of how `reduce` works and therefore the restrictions.  It is a lot clearer now, and I will modify my rethinkdb-net driver to reflect the correct approach.\r\n\r\nOne issue I had with understanding reduce is that my \"fold\"-style function appeared to work correctly when my query had 0, 1, and 2 rows in it.  Would it be possible to validate the reduction function returns the same type as the sequence, so that this isn't a runtime error?\r\n"
