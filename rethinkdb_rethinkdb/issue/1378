        "I have some data in Rethink I was trying to export into csv. I ran the following command:\n\n```\nrethinkdb export --format csv --fields followers -e test.blah2\n```\n\nAnd got the following crash:\n\n```\nTraceback: [('/usr/local/bin/rethinkdb-export.py', 236, 'csv_writer', 'info.append(str(row[field]))')]\nUnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\u2013' in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)\nerrors occurred during export\n```\n\nIt would be nice if:\n1. At least the export command should catch the error, report it, skip the row, and move on\n2. Is it possible to export anyway by using utf8 or some such instead of an ascii encoder?\n\nPinging @Tryneus.\n"
