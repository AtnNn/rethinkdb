      "What's wrong with looping to see when we can read from the table in question?  It seems easy, and it has the pleasant invariant that you know reads succeed on the connection at the end (which gets around any nasty races in the code).\r\n\r\nActually, the server does basically the same thing internally when you call `table_create` -- it does a range read every X ms until that read succeeds.  (You can see this in `wait_for_rdb_table_readiness` in `wait_for_readiness.cc`.)"
