        "Proxies use randomly assigned server IDs. Those can for example show up in the log messages of other servers (e.g. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5456#issuecomment-196419276 ).\n\nFor regular servers, we print \"Server ready, \"newton_ifn\" cb189fa9-06d2-442d-8675-e88d67200067\" on startup. However for proxies, we just print \"Proxy ready.\"\n\nI think we should include the server UUID there as well.\n\nAssigning to @nighelles .\nThis will also make the server connectivity status more useful when proxies are present.\n"
