      "@danielmewes: I actually asked @Tryneus to post this one. I don't think it will be too difficult to do, but it will require a lock in the `start()` method of `Process()` (grr... bad name) objects in the `driver` (grrr... grr... really bad name) module. I think that I already know how that is going to work.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that @Tryneus has already worked around this by excluding the first server in each cluster from the list to take down."
