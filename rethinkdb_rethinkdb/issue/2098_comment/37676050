      "So the tracebacks were intentional, the idea being that if something terrible happens, a user could send us the traceback and we would know exactly what happened (the printed format is a little more compact than the default python traceback).  Still, I can understand it being scary, so I have no objections to removing it if you think it best.  I'll take a look at the pull request.  Thanks for helping out, @Aleaxander!"
