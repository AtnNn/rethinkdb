        "The tests in the `test/changefeeds` folder are not integrated into our testing system, so they never get run. Additionally there are some problems in the tests that need to be rethought/reworked:\r\n- `test.sh` assumes ssh-key based access to arclight and sinister, it should probably be re-written to do everything locally, preferably using the Python testing system (i.e.: `./run`)\r\n- all of the files make assumptions about file locations based on `~`\r\n- all of this needs to hardened to make sure we are testing the drivers we think we are, reference #711"
