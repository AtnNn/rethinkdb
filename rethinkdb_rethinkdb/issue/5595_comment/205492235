      "@larkost @VeXocide  very strange, that error was from a compile 45min ago, but I now see that next has a commit from 4hours ago to fix the issue. Maybe there was a force push of old commits or something. Thanks, looks like this is no longer an issue.\r\n\r\nWRT the .gitattributes, is that just going to be the solution for that from here on out? Your suggested tips fixed the issue, however the issue remains on a fresh checkout of the repo. Either way, looks like you've answered all the questions here, thanks"
