      "Very odd. I wonder if the log messages are relevant. They might be a red herring, since the issue appears to only happen after a while and then goes away once `rethinkdb_data` is deleted.\r\nOn the other hand I think it's also weird that we're getting a \"Protocol wrong type for socket\" error while writing to a presumably already existing socket. I would expect an unsupported protocol type to bubble up when we initially open the socket, not when writing to it.\r\nEither the error message is wrong, or something very odd is going on. @Tryneus any ideas about the protocol error?\r\n\r\n@Ijmir when RethinkDB hangs, could you check two things for us and post the results here?\r\n* how much CPU is the RethinkDB process using at that time?\r\n* what is the content of `rethinkdb_data`?\r\n\r\nThis data might help narrow down the possible causes of this."
