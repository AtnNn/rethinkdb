      "@ambodi It's likely a different issue from what this was about originally. Check out @neumino's comment here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4299#issuecomment-106336033 about what slow-growth mode means.\r\n\r\nI recommend checking the ulimits, specifically the open file limit by running `ulimit -a`. You can also check the RethinkDB log_file for messages like these: `error: accept() failed: Too many open files.`."
