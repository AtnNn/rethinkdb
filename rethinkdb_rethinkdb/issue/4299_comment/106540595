      "After running the tests about 15-20 times in loop the db stops responding and all tests always fail.\r\nCan't reach via web interface too. An error I saw was \"Uncaught RqlDriverError: Handshake timedout\" while trying to connect to DB in hanged mode.\r\nAfter restarting db (by killing the process \"kill -KILL \\<pid\\>\"), it hangs even after the first time the test are running - no need to 20 times loop. Only when I delete the files in \"rethinkdb-data\" and restart db, it doesn't hang immediately."
