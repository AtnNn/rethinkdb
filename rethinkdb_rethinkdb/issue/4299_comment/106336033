      "You can enter slow growth mode, it's doesn't always mean that RethinkDB is dead/hanging.\r\nIt typically happen if you reach the maximum of open file. Basically rethinkdbdash will just slowly try to open connections instead of eagerly opening them.\r\n\r\nI tried running `npm test` in a loop and ended up with https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4300, not sure if it's related though."
