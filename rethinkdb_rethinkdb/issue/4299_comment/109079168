      "A fix for us not catching the stack overflow on OS X is now in code review 2954 by @AtnNn .\r\n\r\n@thaiat this fix will stop RethinkDB from hanging, but instead it is going to crash just like described by @neumino in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4300 .\r\nSo it doesn't fully resolve the problem. There must be some query in the test suite that's very deeply nested that's causing this to happen in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, we plan to implement a protection for such queries such that the query itself will fail, but the server won't crash (our current behavior is obviously bad).\r\n\r\nSorry you had to run into this."
