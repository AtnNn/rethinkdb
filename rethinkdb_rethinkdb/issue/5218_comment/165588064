      "Thanks for writing this up @r-marques .\r\n\r\nI think one of the most curious results in this is that it takes 4 seconds just to get the cursor for the `oderBy.filter` query. The only reason I could imagine for this is that the table traversal takes a long time until it finds the first result that matches the `filter`.\r\n\r\n@r-marques How long does it take to get a cursor for\r\n```py\r\ndef iterate_cursor3():\r\n    changes = r.table('backlog', read_mode=\"outdated\").order_by(index=r.asc('transaction_timestamp'))\\\r\n                   .run(b.conn)\r\n```\r\n(i.e. without the `filter`), on either 1 or 32 shards?"
