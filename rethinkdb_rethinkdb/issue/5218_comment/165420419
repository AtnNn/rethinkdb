      "@r-marques -- what do the timings look like if you create a table with a single shard and replica on the ec2 cluster?  That would let us know how much of the slowdown is due to the hardware difference and how much is due to the number of shards.\r\n\r\nOne potential source of problems here is the logic where we adjust batch sizes based on the number of shards.  If we're setting it too low we'd end up with multiple round trips, and if we're setting it too high we'd end up reading a bunch of useless extra rows from the shards."
