      "Hi @niieani, sorry you're running into this.\r\nThe problem is that VirtualBox shared folders behave differently from normal file systems, which triggers this crash.\r\n\r\nWe're going to work around this in our upcoming 2.0 release, which will work just fine on shared folders. We'll release it next week. You can also try our 2.0 release candidate https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/releases/tag/v2.0.0-0RC1 .\r\n\r\nAlso see https://github.com/stuartpb/rethinkdb-dockerfiles/issues/4\r\n\r\nThis is a duplicate of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3791"
