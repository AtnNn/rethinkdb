      "The premise of this is incorrect, we have long had the `ql` test that runs all of the `test-runner` tests. Additionally `interface.artificial_table` runs a subset with specific options. Finally this is eventually going to go away with #3442.\r\n\r\nTracking test failures is much more complicated, and sadly `buildbot` does not (currently) do anything to help us in this. Long term it is on my list of problems to solve, but that is some ways out both in terms of time and work."
