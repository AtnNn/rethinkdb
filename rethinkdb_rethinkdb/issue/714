        "Users often write code as follows (in semi-pseudocode):\n\n```\nrecords = []\nfor( i= 0; i < 1000000; i++) {\n    records = append(records, document)\n}\n\ntable.insert(records).run()\n```\n\nThe problem with this code is that there is a huge bottleneck in the protobuf libraries and it causes terrible performance. We should internally break the records array up in the driver and convert it to a number of inserts at ~1k docs per insert.\n"
