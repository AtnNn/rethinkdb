      "So what do you think about providing systemd support out of box?\r\n\r\nAnother question related to the service. Arch systemd service provides multiple instances similar to what debian service does. Would it be better to provide simpler one-instance service? I can write and test such file for you. Is multiple-rethinkdb-instances the default usage use-case?"
