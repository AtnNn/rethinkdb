      "Yep, everyone is moving to systemd.\r\n\r\nWe provide the same systemd config file in our docs as the Arch package -- http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/cluster-on-startup/\r\nSo instead of having users copy/paste the systemd file, we should put it in the repo.\r\nHaving it install with `make install` seems like a good idea too.\r\n\r\nAlso @anatol, congrats on becoming an Arch trusted user!"
