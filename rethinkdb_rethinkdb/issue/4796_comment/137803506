      "Thanks @marshall007!\r\n\r\nI think the API looks good.\r\n\r\n@deontologician and @Tryneus could you review the JS and Python implementations respectively when you have a chance please?\r\n\r\nOne thing we should test is if these methods still work with SSL connections. They wouldn't be very useful at the moment, since whatever acts as an SSL proxy between the clients and the server is going to have a different port for its own outgoing connection to the server (this will change when we integrate SSL directly into the server). However we should make sure that they still return something reasonable and don't throw an error.\r\nUntil we have https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4084, this might be a bit of a hassle to set up. I could probably launch a test instance on Compose and test it against that..."
