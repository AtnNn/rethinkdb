      "@danielmewes I think in Node and Ruby we'll always get a numeric address back. The [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html), however, seem to imply we could get back a hostname or address:\r\n\r\n> A pair (host, port) is used for the `AF_INET` address family, where host is a string representing either a hostname in Internet domain notation like `daring.cwi.nl` or an IPv4 address like `100.50.200.5`, and port is an integer.\r\n\r\nI don't think we need to worry about this right now, do you? You only really need `client_port` to filter the `jobs` table and `client_id` will be the more robust option once it's implemented anyway."
