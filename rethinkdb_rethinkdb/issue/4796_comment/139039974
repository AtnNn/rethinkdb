      "@marshall007 I agree that we shouldn't worry about it too much, since as you say the `client_id` will solve the issue better relatively soon.\r\nIf there are multiple client servers, the `client_port` is not going to be sufficient actually, since different client servers can assign the same client port to one of their connections.\r\n\r\nIn my brief test the Python driver actually did give me a numeric address though. I'm not sure under which circumstances it will report a hostname instead.\r\nIt sounds like `socket.getaddrinfo` is the way to get a numeric address from an arbitrary hostname or address string: https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html#socket.getaddrinfo\r\nDo you think it would make sense to call that as part of the `client_address()` implementation for the Python driver, to make sure that we resolve any hostnames that might appear before returning the address to the user?"
